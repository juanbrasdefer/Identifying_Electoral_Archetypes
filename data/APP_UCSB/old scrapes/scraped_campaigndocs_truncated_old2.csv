Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374530",15604,"THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Michigan! (Applause.) Hey! Oh. Oh, it's good to be back in Michigan. (Applause.) Hey, everyone. Can we hear it for Eric Price? (Applause.) Oh, it's good to be back in Michigan. Thank you all so very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you so very much. And, Eric Price, thank you for your leadership of UAW 651, and all the work that you do. (Applause.)And I want to thank all the leaders who are here. This is — I mean, this is — we've got thousands of leaders who are here, and I thank them — (applause) — including all our friends in labor: Shawn Fain, April Verrett — (applause); all of the incredible elected leaders, starting with the Governor Whitmer, who is amazing and is my friend — my dear friend — (applause); Mayor Neeley; Senator Stabenow; Senator Peters; Representative Slotkin, who we will elect to the United States Senate. (Applause.) And did you all see Magic Johnson? (Laughs.) (Applause.) Remember his number: 32? Today we got 32 days until the election. (Laughs.) (Applause.) So, 32 days — 32 days. AUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. We got some business to do. We got some business to do. All right. Thirty-two days. And we know we will do it. (Applause.) And — and this is going to be a very tight race until the very end. This is going to be a very tight race until the very end. We are the underdog, and we know we have some hard work ahead. But here's the thing about us: We like hard work. (Applause.) We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.) And with your help, in November, we will win. We will win. (Applause.) We are not playing around. So, listen, we know this election is about two very different visions for our nation: one focused on the past, and ours, which is focused on the future. (Applause.) We are fighting for a future where we tap into the ambitions and the aspirations of the American people and build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so every American has an opportunity to own a home, build wealth, start a business. (Applause.) And I'm going to speak about small — do we have small-business owners in the house right here? (Applause.) Right? Okay. So, on the economy, I'm just going to spend a minute on small businesses. So — so — because let me tell you. So, growing up, our mother often worked very long hours, and so my sister, Maya, and I, we would go over to Ms. Shelton's house. Ms. Shelton was from Louisiana, and we called her our second mother. And Ms. Shelton was a small-business owner. And so, from being a child, I know who our small-business owners are. They are community leaders, civic leaders. They mentor. They hire locally. They build up the community. They are part of the fabric of the community. (Applause.) And small-business owners are the backbone of America's economy. (Applause.) So, in my plan to build an opportunity economy, one of the things I will do is raise the start-up deduction from $5,000 to $50,000 to help entrepreneurs start their small business. (Applause.) You heard Eric talk about it. We need to build more housing in America. (Applause.) You know, my mother saved up for years to buy our first homes. I was a teenager by the time she saved up enough to do that. And right now, we know there's a serious housing shortage in our country, and it is part of what is driving up costs. So, we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes and provide first-time homebuyers with a $25,000 down payment assistance — (applause) — so you can just literally get your foot in the door, and you'll handle the rest. We need to lower the cost of living. Look, our economy is making good progress. Just this morning, we got a solid jobs report, right? (Applause.) Over 250,000 jobs created last month; unemployment fell; and just a few weeks ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, which helps. (Applause.) But there's still more we need to do. Prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. And I have a plan on lowering costs on everything from health care to groceries, including taking on corporate price gouging. (Applause.) Because as attorney general, I saw what happens where — there are few of them; they don't — not everybody but those who take advantage of desperate people — in particular, in the middle of an emergency — and there needs to be consequence. (Applause.) I will give a tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 extending and expanding the Child Tax Credit, so during the first year of a child's life — (applause) — young parents have the support they need to be able to buy a car seat, to buy a crib, to take care of their child during that first year of their life, knowing it's about setting them on a path to do everything they have a natural desire to do. And, look, let me — I say all this to say: I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.) I will never forget where I come from. And we know we cannot have a strong middle class without American manufacturing. So, over the last three and a half years, we have brought manufacturing back to America, creating 730,000 manufacturing jobs. (Applause.) We announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States. (Applause.) And we did it by investing in American industry and American workers. (Applause.) And I will make sure that America — not China — wins the competition for the 21st century — (applause) — which is why, under my plan, we will invest in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, and the great American auto industry. I see you, Shawn. (Applause.) And we will ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs, from advanced batteries to electric vehicles, are not only invented but built right here in America by American union workers. (Applause.) And, Michigan, let us be clear: Contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive. (Applause.) But here's what I will do. I will invest in communities like Flint — (applause) — Flint, which helped build the auto industry and the UAW. (Applause.) We will retool existing factories, hire locally, and work with unions to create good-paying jobs, including jobs that do not require a college degree — (applause) — because we understand a college degree is not the only measure of whether a worker has skills and experience to get the job done. (Applause.) In fact, part of my plan is to outline all of the federal jobs that should not require a college degree and make that clear. And when I'm elected, I'm going to challenge the private sector to take on the same approach. (Applause.) And then there's Donald Trump. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, Donald Trump has a very different approach. So, Donald Trump makes big promises, and he always fails to deliver. (Applause.) He said he was the only one who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs. Remember that? AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: And then America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president — AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: — including — including tens of thousands of jobs in Michigan. And those losses started before the pandemic, making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers — (applause) — of manufacturing jobs in American history. And his track record for the auto industry was a disaster. He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would, I'll quote, ""not lose one plant"" during his presidency. And then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president. We need a medic over here. We need a medic over here. Right here. Okay. Can everyone part so the medic can come through, please? Let's — let's let the medic through. (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: He's okay. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. He's okay? Okay. Okay. He's okay. All right. We're good. We got each other. (Applause.) Good. Good. Good. So, remembering, again, what Donald Trump talked about versus what he did. Then automakers — American automakers announced the closure of six plants when he was president, including General Motors in Warren and Stellantis in Detroit. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thousands of Michigan autoworkers lost their jobs. And when it came to building the cars of the future, Donald Trump sat on the sidelines and let China dominate. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: And then he talked down to American workers, saying we can't compete with Chinese workers. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: And make no mistake, Donald Trump is no friend of labor. He encouraged automakers to move their plants out of Michigan so they could pay their workers less. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: And when the UAW went on strike to demand higher wages that they deserved, Donald Trump went to a nonunion shop — don't forget — and he attacked the UAW. And he said striking and collective bargaining don't make, quote, ""a damn bit of difference."" AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: Remember how he's talked about striking workers, that you should fire them. That's how he talks about union labor. That's how he talks about workers. But, Flint, we know — we know: Strong unions mean higher wages, better health care, and greater dignity — (applause) — for union members and for everyone. (Applause.) And on top of all of that, Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion tax cut that mostly went to the wealthy and big corporations, not to working people. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: And now he is making the same empty promises to the people in Michigan that he did before. But we will not be fooled. We will not be gaslighted. Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people. (Applause.) And if he wins again, it will be more of the same. Check this out. Two days ago, his running mate — maybe you saw that. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: No, but — how about that Tim Walz, by the way? (Applause.) (Laughs.) That's right. That's right. So, two days ago, Donald Trump's running mate suggested that if Trump wins, he might let the Grand River assembly plant in Lansing close down — AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: — the same plant that our administration helped save earlier this year, along with 650 union jobs. (Applause.) Michigan, we together fought hard for those jobs. And you deserve a president who won't put them at risk. (Applause.) And for anybody watching, you know, if you want to learn more about Donald Trump's plans, just google Project 2025. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts, attack unions, cut Social Security and Medicare, and impose a Trump sales tax — a 20 percent tax on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average pam- — family nearly $4,000 a year. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act — AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: — even after he tried to repeal it time and time again when he was president and still has no plan to replace it. AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Concepts of a plan! THE VICE PRESIDENT: You watched the debate. You watched the debate. You saw that. (Laughs.) (Applause.) He said — AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: He said he, quote, has ""concepts of a plan"" — concepts. Now, you know, I have said that I do believe he is an unserious man. And the consequences — and the consequences of him being president again are absolutely, critically serious. Because, think about it. Even on health care, he has a concept of a plan. So, he's going to threaten the health insurance of 45 million people in our country based on a concept? AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: To take us back — do you remember that? — when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions? Remember what that was like? Well, Michigan, we are not — AUDIENCE: Going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: — going back. We are not going back. (Applause.) We're not going back. We are not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back. No. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because we will move forward. Ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) Ours is a fight for the future, and ours is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.) And these 32 days out from the election, it's important that we remind people how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would overturn Roe v. Wade, and they did. And now more than one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom — (applause) — as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly. And here's what I want to say. Look, and that's not our only battle. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-fon — -won freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote — (applause); the freedom to be safe from gun violence — (applause); the freedom to join a union — (applause); the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride — (applause); and the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water. (Applause.) Flint — you know all too well, Flint, that clean water should be a right for everyone, not just for the people who can afford it. (Applause.) And as president, I will continue to work with communities like Flint to ensure you not only have clean water but the opportunity to recover economically and thrive. (Applause.) So, Michigan, it all comes down to this. We are all here together because we know what is at stake, and we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. We love our country. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We love our country. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And because we love our country, we know it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what this is about. (Applause.) That's what this is about. So, Election Day is in 32 days. (Applause.) And already nearly 2 million ballots are in the hands of Michigan voters alone. (Applause.) So, if you have received your ballot, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it today. Early voting starts statewide on October 26th, and now is the time to make your plan to vote, because, folks, the election is here. The election is here. (Applause.) And we need to energize, organize, and mobilize. (Applause.) And remember: Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. (Applause.) So, Flint, today I ask: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.) And when we fight — AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374521",13437,"THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi. (Applause.) Oh, good afternoon, everybody. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. It is my great honor to be with everybody this afternoon. Matt, I want to thank you for your leadership and for all that you do for so many. You know, everyone here, you all have chosen to live a life of service in the most extraordinary way. And I'm so thankful to all of you — to Matt, for your leadership — and everybody here. And it is so good to be in the house of labor. Thank you all. (Applause.) Thank you all. Thank you all. And, you know, yours is a profession that is more than a profession. It really is about a calling. You know, my — I was just telling Matt — my brother-in-law just retired as a firefighter in California. So, for me, this is personal and it is professional. I know what you guys do, and I know your character. I know your families. I know what it means for the whole community for you all to take on the lives that you have decided to live, and I'm so thankful to you. You guys work long shifts with unpredictable hours in some of the most dangerous conditions. You do so on behalf of people you've never met. Sometimes, those people will never know your name, but because of what you do with such sincerity and the highest level of skill and professionalism, their lives are forever better. And they always know and have the comfort of going to sleep at night knowing that should any tragedy come their way that you guys are out there and would be there. It's an extraordinary thing you do, and it's a great gift that you have that you give. And so, I am so thankful to you. Thank you. (Applause.) And, of course, I am thankful for the union that supports you and your right to all that you deserve in terms of the wages and the benefits that you so rightly have earned. (Applause.) And I also want to thank the other brothers and sisters from labor who are here from UAW — (applause); IBE- — IBEW; LIUNA. Where are your orange T-shirts? I know you're here somewhere. I thank you all, all of you. So, look, just yesterday, we saw another example of the power of collective bargaining — right? — when the longshoremen and the U.S. Maritime Alliance came together, ended a strike, and reached an agreement on a record wage. Right? (Applause.) They did good. They did good. And I say, everywhere I go, look, collective bargaining benefits everybody. And you know the — the term — and I'm looking at our young leaders who are here. I'm so glad you guys are here. (Applause.) So, collective bargaining, it's really — it's just a basic logical point. So, here's what it means. It means that in any negotiation, you want the outcome to be fair. Right? We all want fairness, right? Everybody wants fairness — or should. So, here's the thing about collective bargaining. If you want the outcome to be fair, you got to realize, if you're requiring the one worker to negotiate against the big entity, do we really think that the outcome is going to be fair? Probably not. But if you let the workers together, as the collective, then negotiate against the big entity, it's more likely that the outcome will be fair. That's the basic point of collective bargaining. That's the basic point of why we want our unions to be able to do their work on behalf of workers every day, because we know when union wages go up, everyone's wages go up. (Applause.) Yeah. And when union workplaces are safer, all workplaces are safer. (Applause.) And the bottom line is: When unions are strong, America is strong. (Applause.) And our unions have always fought to make our nation, then, more equal, more fair, and more free. And in this election, in 32 days, everything we have fought for is on the line. This election is about two very different visions for our nation: one that is focused on the past, and ours that is focused on the future. We fight for a future where we protect the fundamental freedom to organize. We fight for a future where workers, all workers, are treated with dignity and respect; a future where we tap into the ambition and the aspirations of the American people and build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has an opportunity to buy a home, start a business, build wealth — intergenerational wealth for their family. Over the last three and a half years, our nation has seen historic small-business creation as an example of that focus. In Michigan alone, we have seen more than 500,000 new small-business applications. And when I am president, I plan to build on that progress and that success, including by raising the start-up deduction — tax deduction for small businesses from $5,000 for — to $50,000 to help more entrepreneurs start a small business. I'll tell you guys, my sister and I were raised by our mother, who worked very hard, and we lived on an apartment above a daycare center. And it was run by and owned by the woman that we called our second mother, who lived two houses down. She was a small-business owner, and her name was Ms. Shelton. And I grew up as a child knowing about who our small businesses are, right? They're leaders in the community. They're civic leaders. They hire locally. They train. And so, that's one of the reasons I'm focused on small businesses as part of how we lift up the middle class in America's economy. We need to also build more housing in America. Housing is too expensive. My mother saved up for years, until I was a teenager, when she was able to buy our first home. And right now, we have a serious housing shortage in America, and that's part of what is driving up costs. And so, we are going to cut red tape, we're going to work with the private sector, and we'll build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term — (applause) — including — including providing first-time homebuyers with a $25,000 down payment assistance so they can just get their foot literally in the door to be able to invest in the American dream — (applause) — which not everyone has access to these days. We need to lower the cost of living, because, look, our economy, while we're making good progress — just this morning, in fact, we got a solid jobs report: over 250,000 jobs created last month, unemployment fell. And just a few weeks ago, the Federal Reserve cut down interest rates, which is going to be great for a lot of folks. But there's still more work we need to do. Prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it. And so, we have a plan to lower costs on everything from health care to groceries, including what I've done in my career as attorney general, which is we got to take on corporate price gouging. We got to take on what we need to do to understand that if you want to grow the middle class, we need more middle-class tax cuts. And the tax cut that is part of my plan will give a tax cut to 100 million Americans. We need to expand Child Tax Credit, and I will do that to expand it to $6,000 so that for the first year of a child's life, their parents have the resources that they need to be able to buy a crib or a car seat, and in that very critical stage of their child's development, just be able to do more than get by but be able to get ahead. And I say all this to say, I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.) And we know we cannot have a strong middle class without American manufacturing. Over the last three and a half years, we brought manufacturing back to America. We created 730,000 manufacturing jobs and announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States. And we did it by investing in American industry and American workers. And I want to make sure that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century. (Applause.) So, under my plan, we will invest in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, and the great American auto industry — (applause) — yeah — so we can ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs, from advanced batteries to electric vehicles, are not only invented but built right here in America by American union workers. (Applause.) So, the election is in 32 days, and Americans have a big choice to make. And I think it's very important, then, to point out Donald Trump has a very different approach than mine. And let's be real about who Donald Trump is. Let's be real. This is a time for real talk. He was handed $400 million on a silver platter and filed for bankruptcy six times. This is a man who has only ever fought for himself. This is a man who has been a union buster his entire career, who has called union leaders, quote, ""Dues Sucking"" people. And as president, he did not lift a finger to save the pensions of millions of American workers. We did. We did. (Applause.) This is a man who sold promise after promise to American workers but never delivered, who said he supports so-called right-to-work laws ""100 percent."" Those are his words. He who joked and laughed about firing striking workers. You remember that? AUDIENCE: Yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Who rolled back labor standards and made it easier for companies that break labor laws to get federal contracts. And Donald Trump is a man who tried to cut funding for our first responders, including SAFER grants for firefighters. So, brothers and sisters, as we stand here in a house of labor, we will not be fooled. We will not be gaslighted. Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people, and he's trying to gaslight people all over our country. But we know the facts and we know the truth: He is an existential threat to America's labor movement. Just look at his track record to know. He said he was the only one who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs — Michigan knows what I'm about to say — then America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president, including tens of thousands of jobs in Michigan. And those losses started before the pandemic, so we're clear, making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs in American history. (Applause.) And recall his record — his track record for the auto industry. He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would, quote, ""not lose one plant"" during his presidency. Then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president, including General Motors in Warren and Stellantis in Detroit. Thousands of Michigan autoworkers lost their jobs. And now he is making the same empty promises to the people of Michigan that he did before, hoping you will forget how he let you down. But we know, if he wins again, it will be more of the same. Everything he intends to do is spelled out in Project 2025. If reelected, he intends to launch a full-on attack on unions and the freedom to organize. He will ban public-sector unions, roll back workplace safety protections, and appoint a union buster to run the Department of Labor. And on top of that, Donald Trump will give billionaires and the biggest corporations massive tax cuts like he did last time. He will cut Social Security and Medicare and impose what I call a Trump sales tax, a 20 percent tax on everyday goods and necessities, which will cost — the economists have said — which will cost the average American over $4,000 a year more. And if that weren't enough, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And even after he tried to repeal it time and time again when he was president, he still has no plan to replace it. Did you guys see the debate? (Laughter and applause.) ""Concepts of a plan."" He has ""concepts of a plan."" (Laughter.) Come on. And, you know, I've said many times he is an unserious human — (laughter) — but the consequence of him is quite serious, because think about that: ""concepts of a plan."" So, he's going to threaten the health care and health coverage of 45 million people in America based on a concept — think about that — to take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was like? So, look, I'm here to say, and I think we all know: It's time to turn the page. It's time to turn the page. (Applause.) We're not going back. America is ready to chart a new way forward, because we are not going back. AUDIENCE MEMBER: No, we're not. We're not going back. THE VICE PRESIDENT: No, we're not. And so, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we know what is at stake. And we are here together — and I'm looking at the young leaders — because we love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) Yes, we do. We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. We have 32 days to get this done, and we know this is going to be a very tight race until the very end. And we are the underdog, so we have some hard work ahead of us. But I know who's here. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.) And we know what we stand for, so we know what to fight for. We stand for opportunity, we stand for dignity, and we stand for the future. And so, we know when we fight — AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374522",10454,"THE VICE PRESIDENT: Can we hear it for Liz Cheney? (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Thank you, Liz! Thank you, Liz! Thank you, Liz! THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is so good to be back in Wisconsin. (Applause.) I thank you, everyone, for being — please have a seat. I thank you all for being here. But I just — I have to emphasize that every time I come here and — and, Liz, I was actually a kid here, too, when my parents were at the University of Wisconsin. (Laughs.) So, we have that in common as well. In fact, Tony Evers always says when I land, ""Welcome home."" (Laughter.) But I — I say all that to say every time that I've come here recently, one of the conversations that we have, all of us together, is how much we love our country and that that really is the binding factor in us all being together and taking the time to be together, to really just renew and remind everyone of what is at stake, but borne out of love that we have this fight. (Applause.) And I want to thank you, Liz Cheney, for reminding us that that, regardless of party affiliation, is a factor that binds us all. And so, I thank you for your support and your leadership and your courage. (Applause.) I also want to thank all the other great leaders who are with us today. Governor Tony Evers — (applause) — where is he? There you are. Thank you. Mayor Grant, thank you for the warm welcome. (Applause.) I want to thank Senator Tammy Baldwin, who is traveling around the state — (applause) — but who I know you will reelect in November. (Applause.) Thank you, Sheriff Michek, for your support and your life of service to the people of Iowa County. (Applause.) And so, I — I do want to say a bit more about Liz Cheney. You all know her leadership, and she has obviously, and so importantly, been a leader for the people of Wyoming, but she has also been an extraordinary national leader and has served with great honor. (Applause.) And she not only, as she has talked today, recognizes that character is among the most important attributes of leadership, but she also personifies that attribute. And she possesses some of the qualities of character that I most respect in any individual and any leader: courage, especially at a moment like this, where there are so many powerful forces that have been intent on trying to demean and belittle and make people afraid. And there are many who know it is wrong, and then there are those who have the courage to speak out loudly about it and the conviction to speak truth. And, you know, it is so admirable when anyone does it, and especially when it is difficult to do in an environment such as this. But Liz Cheney really is a leader who puts country above party and above self, a true patriot — (applause) — and it is my profound honor — my profound honor to have your support. (Applause.) And I also want to thank your father, Vice President Dick Cheney, for his support and — (applause) — and what he has done to serve our country. Every endorsement matters, and this endorsement matters a great deal, Liz. And it carries the spicals — special significance, because, as you said, we may not see eye to eye on every issue, and we are going to get back to a healthy two-party system — I am sure of that — where we will have vigorous debates. (Applause.) And as you said, you may not have — have supported a Democrat for president before, but as you have also said, we both love our country, and we revere our democratic ideals. And we both also believe in the nobility of public service, and we know that our oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America is a sacred oath — an oath that must be honored and must never be violated. (Applause.) And your words today and the reason we are all here today, I think, really do underscore perhaps one of the most fundamental questions that is facing the American people in this election: Who will obey that oath? Who will abide by the oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States of America? (Applause.) I have had the privilege — (laughs). AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution six times in my career, including as vice president, as a United States senator, and as the top law enforcement officer of the largest state in our country (Applause.) Responsible for upholding and enforcing the laws of the state and the laws of the United States was the work I did. And I have never wavered in upholding that oath, and I have always executed it faithfully and without reservation. (Applause.) And therein lies the profound difference between Donald Trump and me. He, who violated the oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. And make no mistake: He, who if given the chance, would violate it again. Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. (Applause.) And as you have heard and know, he refused to accept the will of the people and the results of an election that was free and fair. As you have heard, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. He threatened the life of his own vice president and refused to engage in the peaceful transfer of power. And let us be clear about how he intends to use power if elected again. He has called for jailing journalists, political opponents, anyone he sees and deems as being an enemy. He has pledged to destroy the independence of the Department of Justice, and he called for deploying our active-duty military against our own citizens. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Kristallnacht! Weird! AUDIENCE MEMBER: He's weird! THE VICE PRESIDENT: W- — I — well, I believe — AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're not going back! AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: You and my running mate both. (Laughing.) Well, listen, I believe that anyone who recklessly tramples on our democratic values, as Donald Trump has; anyone who has actively and violently obstructed the will of the people and the peaceful transfer of power, as Donald Trump has; anyone who has called for, I quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States, as Donald Trump has, must never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. (Applause.) And the tragic truth — the tragic truth that we are facing in this election for president of the United States is that there is actually an honest question about whether one of the candidates will uphold the oath to the Constitution of the United States. That is the tragic truth of this election, that this is actually an honest question that we are having as Americans. And I know the vast majority of us agree that upholding the Constitution must be a basic requirement we expect of anyone seeking the highest office in the land. I know the vast majority of us, regardless of your political party, agree we must hold sacred America's fundamental principles — from the rule of law, to free and fair elections, to the peaceful transfer of power. (Applause.) And if you share — if you share that view, no matter your political party, there is a place for you with us and in this campaign, because those principles, I know, unite us across party lines. And in this election, I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans. My entire career — (applause) — my entire career, I've only had one client: the people. (Applause.) And when I say that — and when I say that I mean all the people, not just those who share my party affiliation. Through all my decades in law enforcement, I never asked a victim or a witness, ""Are you a Republican or a Democrat?"" The only question I ever asked was, ""Are you okay?"" And that is the kind of president we deserve, and I pledge to you that is the kind of president I will be. (Applause.) Because the president of the United States must not look at our country through the narrow lens of ideology or petty partisanship or self-interest. The president of the United States must not look at our country as an instrument for their own ambitions. Our nation is not some spoil to be won. The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised — the nation that inspired the world to believe in the possibilities of a representative government. And so, in the face of those who would endanger our magnificent experiment, people of every party must stand together. And let me be clear: Democracy and freedom are not only at stake here at home; they are also at stake around the world. As president of the United States, I will strengthen, not abdicate America's global leadership. (Applause.) Last week, I met with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy — (applause) — and the message I delivered was the same message I've shared with him every time I've seen him: I stand with Ukraine, and I always will. (Applause.) And I told him, as I have before, I want Ukraine to prevail. By contrast, in our debate, Donald Trump couldn't even bring himself to say he wanted Ukraine to win the war — couldn't even bring himself to say that. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: A war that Putin, a brutal dictator, launched against a free and independent people. Trump wants to force Ukraine to give up its sovereign territory, a bedrock principle upon which we stand and fight for. And you know who else wants them to give up their sovereign — AUDIENCE MEMBER: Putin! THE VICE PRESIDENT: — absolutely — territory. (Laughter.) Putin. Putin. And that's not a plan for peace. It's a plan for surrender. Well, I believe that in the global struggle between tyranny and democracy, the president of the United States must always be on the side of freedom. (Applause.) So, we are gathered here today in Ripon, not far, as the congresswoman mentioned, from a small building where the Republican Party was born in 1854. Liz Cheney stands in the finest tradition of its leaders.(Applause.) And if — and if people across Wisconsin and our nation are willing to do what Liz is doing to stand up for the rule of law, for our democratic ideals, and the Constitution of the United States, then together, I know we can chart a new way forward not as members of any one party but as Americans.(Applause.) Americans who are united — united in our devotion to the country we love. I thank you all. May God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)","","",""

Good evening. Good evening. (Applause.) (Inaudible.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you all. Thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) And can we please hear it for Captain Quintero? (Applause.) Oh, thank you all. Thank you, everyone. Oh, it is so wonderful to be back in Nevada. Thank you all. Thank you. (Applause.) And happy Hispanic Heritage Month to everyone. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you all. It's good to be back, and I want to thank everyone for all that you do. I know we have some extraordinary elected leaders here, and I want to thank them for their incredible work and friendship. It is good to be with all the leaders who are here, including Representative Susie Lee, who is here — (applause); Steven Horsford — (applause); Dina Titus — (applause); the great General Ford — (applause); Senator Catherine Cortez Masto — (applause); Senator Jacky Rosen, who we're going to send back to the United States Senate. (Applause.) Thank you, everyone, and all the local leaders here. There are so many leaders here. It is good to be back with you. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you. And wait a minute. We also tonight have here some of the Vegas Raiders, who won their game tonight. (Applause.) Thank you. Congratulations. Oh, congratulations. You came right from the game. Congratulations. Give them an applause, right? (Applause.) Well done. Well done. Well done. So, in all seriousness, everyone, before I begin, I want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. And please have a seat if you're able. I want to talk about Hurricane Helene for a moment, and I know that everyone here sends their thoughts and prayers for the folks who have been so devastated by that hurricane and the ensuing events in Florida, in Georgia, the Carolinas, and other impacted states. And we know that so many have been impacted; some have died. But I want to thank everyone for doing everything you can to think about them. Send them your thoughts. Send them your prayers. I want to thank the first responders who have done so much. (Applause.) And we will stand with these communities for as long as it takes to make sure that they are able to recover and rebuild. Earlier today, I received an operational briefing from FEMA Director Criswell. More than 3,300 federal personnel have been mobilized. We are deploying food, water, and generators and working to restore water and power. (Applause.) And the president and I have told state and local leaders we will provide whatever help they need in the days and weeks ahead. And so, I thank you all for sending your best wishes to everyone there. Thank you. (Applause.) So, Las Vegas, we have 37 days until the election. (Applause.) Thirty-seven days. And we know this will be a tight race until the very end. And let's level set. We are the underdog. We are the underdog, and we have some hard work ahead. But here's the thing. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.) And with your help, we will win in November. (Applause.) Yes, we will. Yes, we will. Yes, we will. AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win. AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win. AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win. And here's why — and here's why — and here's why: Because we here know that this election is about two very different visions for our nation. And the contrast, I think, was quite clear in our debate. Did you all see the debate? (Applause.) You saw — you saw the debate. You saw the debate. Yeah, yeah. And in two days, I know we will cheer on Coach Walz when he debates J.D. Vance. (Applause.) Yeah. But listen, also, their debate should not be the last word. I'm trying to debate Donald Trump again and — (applause) — I think he should debate again. The American people have a right to hear us discuss the issues. And as you say here in Las Vegas, I'm all in. I'm all in — (applause) — even if my opponent is ready to fold, so there you go. But you will remember, in our first debate, I talked about issues like bringing down the cost of living, investing in small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom — (applause) — and keeping our nation secure. (Applause.) But from Donald Trump, well, it was the same old, tired playbook — same old, tired playbook — with no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. Well, folks, it's time to turn the page. (Applause.) It's time to turn the page. America is ready to chart a new way forward — (applause) — ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership — (applause) — which is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign, because we know we need a president who works for all the American people. (Applause.) Enough of the division. Enough of the hate. We are all in this together. (Applause.) And you all know, for my entire career, I've only had one client: the people. The people. (Applause.) From being a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators. (Applause.) As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks — (applause) — and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. (Applause.) I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by for-profit colleges — (applause) — for workers who were being cheated out of their wages. (Applause.) And I pledge to you, as president, I will fight for all Americans. And together, we will build a brighter future for our nation. (Applause.) We will build a future that includes thinking about our economy in a way that it is about lifting everyone up. We will build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business. (Applause.) And let me tell you, I love our small businesses, of which I've met so many right here in Vegas. (Applause.) You know, growing up, our mother worked very long hours, and so, my sister Maya and I would go over two doors down to Ms. Shelton's house. She — we called her our second mother. And Ms. Shelton was a small-business owner. So, I know, since I was a young child, who our small businesses are, who our small-business owners are. Small businesses are the backbone of America's economy. (Applause.) I know that. I know that. And Latina small-business owners are the fastest growing segment of our economy. (Applause.) So, my plan is about tapping into that ambition, those aspirations, those dreams, those incredible ideas, that strong work ethic that people have, also understanding not everybody gets handed $4 million on a silver platter and files for bankruptcy six times. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, my plan is about saying we've got to help entrepreneurs, startups out, and I will give a $50,000 tax deduction to help entrepreneurs start their small businesses. (Applause.) Because right now, that tax deduction is $5,000. Can't nobody start a small business in 2024. So, we're going — we are going to make it something what — where it is doable to lift folks up. We also need to build more housing in America. (Applause.) My mother saved up for years, until I was a teenager, when she was able to buy our first home. And right now, a serious housing shortage is part of what is driving up cost. So, we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes — (applause) — and provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 down-payment assistance — (applause) — so you can just get your foot in the door. You'll do the rest. And we must lower the cost of living, because while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it. So, I have a plan that includes lowering costs on everything from health care to groceries, including I will take on the corporate price gouging that we know — (applause) — has resulted in jacking prices up, often around tragedies and emergencies. We will give a tax cut to 100 million more Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life — (applause) — knowing that the vast majority of our young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well but not always the resources to do it. And that $6,000 in extending and expanding the Child Tax Credit will help buying a crib, buying a car seat, doing the things that are so critical in that first phase of life. I will also make sure good-paying jobs are available to all Americans, not only those with college degrees. (Applause.) Because we need to recognize the value of additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs. (Applause.) And so, as president, part of how I'm going to push this forward is I will get rid of unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs — (applause) — understanding that having a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a worker. (Applause.) And when we do that with the federal workforce, I'm coming to ask the private sector — challenge you to do the same. (Applause.) So, all of this is to say I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.) Never. Now, Donald Trump has a different plan. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Just google ""Project 2025."" AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: Which, I have to say, I still can't believe they put that thing in writing. (Laughter.) They printed it up. They bound it. They handed it out. Just google it. It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he would do if he were elected again as president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts again — AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: — cut Social Security and Medicare — AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and impose what I call a ""Trump sales tax,"" which would be a 20 percent tax on everyday basic necessities — AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which economists have measured would cost the average family nearly 4,000 more dollars a year in everyday expenses. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of all this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he has no plan to replace it. He has, quote, ""concepts of a plan."" (Applause.) ""Concepts."" So, here's the thing, though. We can laugh about many things, but the consequences of this are quite serious — quite serious. Because think about it: He's going to threaten health coverage and health insurance for 45 million people in our country based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was like? AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We — we will move forward and — (applause) — and we will take on the biggest issues facing our nation. We have talked about the economy. We have talked about what we can do in terms of investing in the ambition, the aspirations of our country. We will take on the issue of immigration. We will take on a number of issues. On the subject of immigration, we must have comprehensive immigration reform — (applause) — with strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship — (applause) — including for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years, including our DREAMers — (applause) — including our DREAMers. And I was attorney general of a border state. I prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings. And as president, I will double the resources for the Department of Justice to go after those transnational cartels — (applause) — and take action to stop the flow of fentanyl coming into our country, which is destroying entire communities. (Applause.) These are serious problems, and we know Donald Trump won't solve them. When he was president, he did nothing to fix our immigration system. (Applause.) And earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades, and Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought that that bill, if passed, would have hurt him, and he'd prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. That's not the kind of president we want. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: As president, he cruelly separated families and plans to do it again. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he continues to fan the flames of fear and division. Look, we need a president who cares more about solving problems than playing political games and demeaning people full time. (Applause.) We're tired of that. We're — we're done with that. So, Nevada, ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.) And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court — the court of Thurgood and RBG — AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: — so that they would do as they did and overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade. And now one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban — AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: — many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest. It is immoral. Immoral. And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. (Applause.) If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.) Come on. And with Jacky Rosen back in the United States Senate — (applause) — when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly sign it into law. And, Nevada, you know I'm traveling all over our country. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote, the freedom to join a union, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride — (applause) — and the freedom to be safe from gun violence — (applause) — which after 1 October Nevada proved that smart gun safety laws are just common sense. (Applause.) So, look, generations before us, generations of America led the fight for freedom, and the baton — well, it's now in our hands. It's now in our hands. (Applause.) And it all comes down to this. We are here together. You came out on a Sunday evening. We are here together because we know what is at stake, and we are here together because we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I do believe — I do believe that one of the highest forms of patriotism that we could show is to then fight for the ideals of our country. That's what this is about. It is a fight to realize the promise of America. (Applause.) And I know the people of Nevada; you are Battle Born. You are Battle Born. (Applause.) Yes, you are. And we are all ready for the work ahead. Thirty-seven days. (Applause.) Thirty-seven days. And here in Nevada, every voter will receive a ballot in the mail, and in-person early voting starts October 19th. (Applause.) So, now is the time to make your plan for how you are going to vote. Okay? And I'd ask you to start making your plan now for how you are going to vote. And if you choose to vote by mail, do not wait. Fill out your battl- — ballot, sign it, and send it back right away. (Applause.) Okay? And tell your neighbors. Because, folks, the election is here — (applause) — and we need to energize and organize and mobilize. And remember, your vote is your voice. Your voice is your power. Don't ever let anybody take your power from you. Never. (Applause.) Never. Don't let anybody silence you ever. So, Las Vegas, today, I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.) And when we fight — AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you. (Applause.)","","",""

Can we please applaud Theresa and her extraordinary courage? Please, can we applaud her extraordinary courage? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please have a seat, everyone. Thank you. It's good to be back in Arizona. (Applause.) It is good to be back in Arizona. Thank you all. Thank you so very much. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. I appreciate — thank you so very much. I — I just want to, for a moment, speak about Theresa. We — we had some time together backstage. And, you know, I think that in moments of crisis, such as the fentanyl crisis, there are people who, through their suffering and their pain, rise with courage in such a selfless way to be a voice for others with the anticipation and the hope and the hard work of hoping that their story will be the reason other people don't have that story. And you sharing your story about Jacob and your advocacy on why we have to stop this scourge is so incredibly important. And, again, I applaud Theresa, and I know we all do. (Applause.) And our need to stop this issue is one of the reasons that we are all here together today. I also want to thank the extraordinary elected officials who are here. Senator Mark Kelly, who came with me. (Applause.) He had — and his extraordinary wife, Gabby Giffords, traveled with me from Washington, D.C. to be here. And Senator Kelly has been talking with me for quite some time about the importance of this visit. And so, I thank you in front of all of our friends for your work. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Attorney General Kris Mayes, who just tore up the floor up. (Applause.) She is, you know, one of — well, I'm going to talk a bit about it in a minute, but some of the work that — that I have done in my career as attorney general and watching her do the work that she has done as attorney general really does emphasize the importance of having the right leader at the right time in the right place, and that's who she is. (Applause.) Mayor Huish, I thank you for the warm welcome. We've spent some time together. You've shared with me the needs of your community. (Applause.) And I thank you for your leadership as well. And to all the elected and community leaders here today, thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. Before I begin, I do want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. I spoke this morning with our FEMA Administrator Criswell, and President Biden and I, of course, will continue to monitor the situation closely. We have mobilized more than 1,500 federal personnel to support those communities that have been impacted. We have food, water, and generators that are ready for deployment, and — (applause) — we are working to restore power for — for millions of people who currently are experiencing outages. And I just want to stress — and for the — the press that is here, to those who are watching — the storm continues to be dangerous and deadly, and lives have been lost, and the risk of flooding still remains high. So, I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment. So, thank you all. And — and now I'll speak about, in particular, the people who are here today and why we are gathered here together today. So, Arizona, I think you all know, and this is why you are here, there are consequential issues at stake in this election, and one is the security of our border. The United States is a sovereign nation, and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them, and I take that responsibility very seriously. We are also a nation of immigrants. The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story, and so we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that it is humane, and that it makes our country stronger. (Applause.) So, I've just come from visiting the border and the port of entry in Douglas. I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and Customs officers who every day see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port. These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help keep our nation secure, and they need more resources to do their jobs, which is why we have and are in the process of investing half a billion dollars to modernize and expand the port of entry here in Douglas — (applause) — and why last December I helped raise the rate of overtime pay for border agents — (applause) — and also why I strongly supported the comprehensive border security bill written last year — written last year, as you know, by a bipartisan group of senators, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Congress. That bill would have hired 1,500 more border agents and officers. It would have paid for 100 inspection machines to detect fentanyl that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. It would have allowed us to more quickly and effectively remove those who come here illegally. And it would have increased the number of immigration judges and asylum officers. It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol union, and it should be in effect today, producing results in real time right now for our country. (Applause.) But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said, ""Stop the bill."" Because, you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. (Applause.) And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future. (Applause.) And so, even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the border security bill, it is my pledge to you that as president of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) And let me say, the issue of border security is not a new issue to me. I was attorney general of a border state for two terms. I saw the violence and chaos that transnational criminal organizations cause and the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs. I walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United States. I've seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room, complete with lighting and air conditioning, making very clear that it is about an enterprise that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. And my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings. My team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican cartels. We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa Cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the United States. We seized millions of dollars' worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cortel — Cartel and broke up a drun- — a drug trafficking operation, including pill mills and so-called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results. As attorney general of California, it was 10 years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American attorneys general and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet with Mexican attorneys general to address this issue and, in particular, to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity. All of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers. And I started, as attorney general, the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy. So, stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me, and it is a long-standing priority of mine. I have done that work, and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected president of the United States. (Applause.) And it is my pledge to you, understanding how solutions get formed, that I will reach across the aisle and I will embrace commonsense approaches and new technologies to get the job done, because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs, and human beings, could care less who somebody voted for in the last election. (Applause.) They could care less. They've got one goal in mind, and it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would work with other leaders for commonsense solutions, understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don't work together to fix these problems. And look, I — transnational gangs, one of the things I know about them, they are always innovating. So, to disrupt them, we must do the same, and that means, again, working together in real time, grounded on finding commonsense approaches, not just about some rhetoric at a rally but actually doing the work of fixing a problem. (Applause.) And as president, I won't only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked; I will do more to secure our border. To reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry. Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from reentering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States, our system must be orderly and secure, and that is my goal. (Applause.) And that is my goal. Securing our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities. Fentanyl is a scourge on our country. The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal, so much so that using it one time only can be fatal. I have met far too many families, parents, loved ones who have lost a family member, a child to fentanyl, and their grief is heartbreaking. And the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities. It's impacting communities across our country, regardless of where they are geographically, politically, or any other demographic you cl- — you choose to talk about. It's a scourge in our country, and we have to take it seriously. And as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. (Applause.) And I know everyone here understands that most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico. Most often, they are smuggling it through vehicles at legal ports of entry, like the one I visited today. The fact is, border officers don't have enough resources and are only able to search a fraction of the vehicles that pass through their checkpoints. This is unacceptable. They need the resources to do their jobs. And as we could have done with that border security bill, I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines — more personnel, more training, and more technology, including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles. And we will make sure that our ports of entry, including airports and seaports, have additional state-of-the-art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it. I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels. (Applause.) Yes. I will ensure that we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain, because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country. My approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl are by and large made in China and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here into the United States. Our administration demanded that China crack down on the companies that make those chemicals, and it has started to happen, but they need to do more. And as president, I will hold them to their commitment to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals coming from China. (Applause.) Yeah. And all of this to say, we must tackle this issue from every angle, because our highest charge must be to protect the lives of our people. It must be to understand the pain and to have the courage to know that the solutions are at hand if we focus on fixing a problem instead of running on a problem. (Applause.) And on this issue, writ large, we must ensure that our country remains strong and competitive, which includes fixing our broken immigration system. (Applause.) And let me be clear, I reject the false choice — I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly, and humane. We can and we must do both. (Applause.) We must do both. And we need clear, legal pathways for people seeking to come into our country — (applause) — and we must make our current system work better. For example, it can take years for asylum claims to be decided. Well, this is a problem we can solve, including by hiring more asylum officers and expanding processing centers in people's home countries. (Applause.) And as president, I will work with Congress to create, at long last, a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years — (applause) — for years and deserve to have a system that works. I also have in mind our DREAMers. I have met — (applause) — I have met with so many of our DREAMers throughout my career. They who have grown up in the United States, were educated here, pay taxes here, serve in our military, and contribute to our communities every day. They are American in every way, but still, they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship. And this problem has gone unsolved, at this point now, for decades. The same goes for farm workers who ensure that we have food on our tables — (applause) — and who sustain our agricultural industry, and they, too, have been in legal limbo for years because politicians have refused to come together to fix our broken immigration system. Well, as president, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions — solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long. (Applause.) For far too long, we have all known this is not working as it can and as it should. And so, as I said at the beginning, these issues are highly consequential for our nation, and the contrast in this election is clear. It is a choice between commonsense solutions and the same old political games. In the four years that Donald Trump was president, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system. He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges. He did not solve the shortage of border agents. He did not create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system and did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge. (Applause.) As overdoses went up during his presidency, he fought to slash funding for the fight against fentanyl. And what did he do instead? Well, let's talk about that. He separated families. He ripped toddlers out of their mother's arms, put children in cages, and tried to end protections for DREAMers. He made the challenges at the border worse. And he is still — and he is still fanning the flames of fear and division. And let me be clear, that is not the work of a leader. That is not the work of a leader, and that is, in fact, I think we all believe, an abdication of leadership. (Applause.) And so, on behalf of all across our nation who want to see these problems solved, I say we cannot accept Donald Trump's failure to lead. We should not permit scapegoating instead of solutions. And let's see what's happening. Let's not permit scapegoating instead of solutions or rhetoric instead of results. As your president, I will protect our nation's sovereignty, secure our border, and work to fix our broken — broken system of immigration, and I will partner with Democrats, Republicans and independents to do it. (Applause.) Arizona, it is time for us to turn the page on the ugly battles that have characterized our politics, and it is time to move forward together to achieve real solutions that make our country stronger. And I know we can get this done. I know we have the will. I know we have the courage. I know the solutions are at hand, and I know we are ready. (Applause.) And so, with all of that, I say, thank you. May God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you all.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374389",17368,"THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. (Applause.) Good afternoon. Hi, everyone. (Applause.) Good afternoon. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Okay. We have work to do. We have work to do. (Laughs.) Please have a seat, everyone. Oh, it's so good to see so many friends. Thank you all, and thank you for all you have done to be so supportive. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you for all that you have done and for taking the time to be here on this Sunday afternoon. It means so much. And we have a lot of work to do, but there's a lot of work that's already happened thanks to all of you. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you. And this is a room full of incredible leaders, including, of course, our governor of New York, Kathy Hochul — (applause); Leader Schumer, who has been an extraordinary partner to the president and me — (applause); members of Congress, including Representative Goldman. (Applause.) And to all the dear friends and long-standing partners here today, I thank you. I thank you. All right. Let's level set. Everybody get — just get comfortable. (Laughs.) Let's level set. We have 44 days — 44 days. And every four years — because a lot of us have been in rooms like this every four years, if not more frequently — and we say, every four years, ""This is the one."" Well, this here is the one. This is the one. (Applause.) This is the one. This is probably the most important election of our lifetime and probably one of the most important in the lifetime of our nation. And this election really is about two very different visions for our nation, a contrast that I think became very clear in the recent debate. (Applause.) And, by the way, I think we should have another debate. (Applause.) I just accepted an invitation to debate in October, which my opponent seems to be looking for an excuse to avoid. But he should accept. In all seriousness, he should accept, because I feel very strongly that we owe it to the American people and to the voters to meet once more before Election Day and continue the conversation from that first debate. (Applause.) And in that debate, you'll remember, I talked about my plans to bring down the cost of living, to invest in America's small businesses, to protect reproductive freedom, and keep our nation safe. (Applause.) But that's not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, it was the same old show; the same old, tired playbook that we've heard for years, with no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people. Well, it's time to turn the page. (Applause.) It's time to turn the page. And America is ready to chart a new way forward, ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic — optimistic about what we can do together. (Applause.) And I do believe that is why Democrats and Republicans and independents are supporting our campaign, because they want a president who works for all the American people, and that is the kind of president I pledge to you that I will be. I have, my entire career, fought for the people. As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As attorney general of California, I defended communities that were being poisoned by polluters and Big Oil. I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges, for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due, for seniors facing elder abuse. And as president, I will fight on behalf of all Americans. And I know that, together, we can and we must build a brighter future for our nation, a future where we build what I called an ""opportunity economy"" — an economy where everyone can compete and everyone has a real chance to succeed; where middle-class families have security and stability; and all Americans, regardless of who they are or where they start, can build wealth for themselves and their children. To build that opportunity economy, I will bring together labor, small business, founders, and innovators in major companies. We will partner together to invest in America's competitiveness, to invest in America's future. We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors. We will create a stable business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road. We will invest in semiconductors, clean energy, and other industries of the future. And we will cut needless bureaucracy and unnecessary red tape, all of which will create jobs, drive broad-based economic growth, and cement America's leadership throughout the world. (Applause.) The way I see it, this is motivated and designed in large part knowing that the vast majority of Americans don't want to just be able to get by. They want to get ahead. They want to get ahead. They want to be able to own a home, build wealth, start a business. And so, I'll tell you a little bit more about some specific plans I have — and, again, in contrast to my opponent, who offers very little. (Laughter.) So, for example, I'll tell you I love our small businesses. I love small businesses. (Applause.) I really do. And maybe it's because, growing up — and my sister Maya is here — (applause) — you know, when we were growing up — she's somewhere, usually in the back of the room. There she is. Well, when we were growing up, we lived in an apartment above a childcare center, and that childcare center was owned by Mrs. Shelton, who lived two doors down from us. And Mrs. Shelton helped my mother raise us. When my mother worked long days and worked on the weekends, Mrs. Shelton helped raise us to the point that Maya and I have always called Mrs. Shelton our ""second mother."" Well, Mrs. Shelton was a small-business owner, and I will tell you that I learned from childhood the character of a small-business owner. She was a matriarch of the community. She mentored. She hired locally. She was part of the civic fabric. And in addition, then, to being a business leader, she was a civic leader. And when I travel our country — and I have been traveling our country a lot recently, but — but for the last four years, I meet our small-business owners, and they are literally — and I think we would all know this — small businesses are the backbone of America's economy. They really are. (Applause.) So, my plan includes giving a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses. (Applause.) Because here's the deal. Right now, the tax deduction for start-ups is $5,000. Nobody can start a small business on that. If we really mean that we want to fuel the innovation, if we want to reward the ambition, we got to do better. We also need to build more housing in America. (Applause.) And so, when I referred earlier to part of how I think about things, it includes cutting the red tape. And on the issue of building more housing, working with the private sector so that, by the end of my first term, we can build 3 million new homes. (Applause.) Part of my plan includes lowering the cost of living for America's middle-class families. Because look, I grew up a middle-class kid, and I will never forget where I came from. And I have a plan, then, to bring down costs on everything from health care to groceries, because it's a real impediment to people's ability to get ahead, and we've got to bring down those costs. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life. (Applause.) Because, look, new parents, wherever they are, whoever they are, have a natural desire to parent their children well but not always the resources that are necessary to do that. And it is in our collective benefit to be able to help them, especially when you're talking about such a fundamental phase of their child's development. So, that $6,000, that's going to include giving them support to buy a car seat, to buy a crib, to just take care of those basic necessities at a critical time. All of that to say: Donald Trump has a very different plan based on a very different vision of who we are and the needs of the American people. And I've said this before, and I'll say it again: In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the consequences of putting him back in the White House are extremely serious — extremely serious. (Applause.) Look, for example, at Project 2025. And, you know, honestly, I just have to keep saying this. I can't believe they put that thing in writing. (Laughter.) I mean, they didn't just put it in writing. They — they bound it and — and handed it out. And, you know, if you can't sleep one night, google it. Because — because here's the thing. It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if elected president again. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare; to repeal our climate investments and send thousands of good-paying clean energy jobs overseas; and he wants to impose what I call a ""Trump sales tax,"" a 20 percent tax on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year. And top economists have reviewed our plans. Goldman Sachs says my plan would grow our economy and that his plan would shrink it. Sixteen Nobel Prize-winning economists have said he would reignite inflation. Moody's assessed he would ignite a recession by the middle of next year. On top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And as he said in the debate, he has — I'm going to quote now — (laughter) — ""concepts of a plan."" (Laughter and applause.) ""Concepts"" to replace it. In all seriousness, think about this. So, he's going to threaten the health insurance of 45 million people based on a concept. Serious consequences we're talking about. And if he were to do that, it would take us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. Remember what that was like — for so many people in our country what that meant, not having access to the health care they need? So, I will say, then, what I say everywhere I go and when I'm in those rooms — those very big rooms with a lot of people — yeah — (laughter and applause). I couldn't help myself. But what I say there and — and folks will repeat: We are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. We are not going back. Because, as much of anything, our fight is a fight for the future. Our fight is a fight for the future. I was saying to some folks I was talking with earlier: We're not fighting against something; we're fighting for something. And ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) And ours is a fight for freedom — (applause) — because you all know — and as I travel the country it becomes increasingly clear to me — there is a full-on attack afoot against hard-fought, hard-won, fundamental freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote. The — in Georgia — right? — passed a law that basically makes it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote. Think about that. The hypocrisy abounds. Whatever happened to ""love thy neighbor""? Attacks on the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.) And on that point, y- — many will remember: I was one of the first electeds in the country — it was Valentine's weekend of 2004 — to perform same-sex marriages. Twenty — (applause). So, this last February, we just celebrated the 20th anniversary of that. But think about this. Think about this. It pains my heart when I think about that and think about something like in Florida and a ""Don't Say Gay"" law and what that means, because, if you think about it, among the people directly impacted are teachers. And think about that young teacher who is probably in their 20s who is afraid to put up a photograph of themselves and their partner for fear they could be fired. For doing what job? God's work — teaching other people's children. So, this is real, what we're looking at, in terms of these attacks on fundamental freedoms and rights. And, of course, front of mind for so many is the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.) And on that point, let's always remember and remind folks of how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court — the court of Thurgood and RBG — with the intention that they would overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. And now more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral. (Applause.) It is immoral to tell a survivor of a crime of violence to their body, of violation of their body, that they don't have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. It's immoral. And as I travel the country, most people agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.) Not the government. Elections matter. Elections matter. And I'll tell you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly sign it into law. So, so much is at stake and on the line in this election. And this is not 2016 or 2020. It's not '16 or '20, because — for many reasons, including what happened a couple of months ago when the Supreme Court — the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president that he is effectively immune for whatever he does when he's in the White House. Now, think about that. So, at least before that ruling, there was the appearance or the threat of consequence, but now there is essentially explicit authority to do whatever he wants. And let's put this ruling, then — this decision in context. This is a man who has vowed that he will be a dictator on day one. He has said he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. He has called for, and I'm going to quote, the ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States. So, just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. So, all this to say: Forty-four days. And we're all here together, and you all have taken the time out of your busy lives, because we know what is at stake. And we are all here together because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. We love our country. And I do believe that it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight for us to realize the promise of America. So, 44 days. And early voting has already started in some states. So, essentially, the election is here, right? And this race — and I cannot emphasize this enough — this race is as close as it could be. It's as close as it could be. This is a margin-of-error race. I know we've got a lot of enthusiasm and excitement about all that is possible. This is a margin-of-error race. And I'm running — and we are running — as the underdog in this race. Our campaign is doing the work we need to do on the airwaves, on voter education in every county of every battleground state. And we are leading in many ways in terms of what we are committed to doing to build up that grassroots and community-based leadership. And in the process of all of that, we are leaving it all on the field. And your support, as you know, which is why you've been so generous — your support is absolutely critical to the work we have in front of us. The leaders in this room have done so much already, and I'm going to ask for a bit more. (Laughter.) So, here's what I'm asking for. The leaders here are part of large networks. Everyone here is part of many large networks in which you are an opinion leader. I need you to activate those networks — to tell your friends, your colleagues, your neighbors about the stakes. Tell them how close this race is, and let them know why you support our campaign. And let them know we need their help also in the next 44 days. And we need their help to please join our team in battleground states and help folks register to vote and get them to the polls; to sign up to make phone calls, to do that kind of work that really is so fundamentally important that's about that human interaction that I think so many people are really craving to remind us that we're all in this together. And I'll say this. In this campaign, let's also be intentional about building community and building coalitions and bringing folks together, because I do believe that the work we are doing right now — yes, our first imperative is to win, but it is also to build — to build community and coalitions and to remind people that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. I think there's a hunger for that right now in our country. (Applause.) So, all that to say: This is a fight for our freedom and our future, and the baton is in our hands. It's in our hands. (Applause.) And so, I'll end by saying what I say at every rally. When we fight — AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you, all. Thank you, all. Thank you. (Applause.)","","",""

Please have a seat, everyone. Please have a seat. It's so good to be back in Atlanta. Thank you all. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Thank you. You know, I — I just want to say — AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible) to have you. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Laughter.) I just — I want to say about Dr. Reddick — you know, I — some of you may have seen I did a — an event last night with Oprah Winfrey and — (applause) — and that — it highlighted so many tragic stories, but it also highlighted so many important issues, which is why everyone has taken time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. And it highlighted the importance of a Dr. Reddick. AUDIENCE: Yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because the courage, Dr. Reddick, that you are showing in the face of these arcane and immoral laws, to stand so publicly and talk about your commitment to your oath and to the health and well-being of people who need to be seen and treated with dignity is so extraordinary. And I do believe, in moments of crisis, the world has a way of revealing the heroes among us. (Applause.) And I would say, Dr. Reddick, you are one of them. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you. And thank you to all of the elected and community leaders who have joined us today. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, everybody — everybody who is here. So, Georgia, the- — this election right here is a fight for the future. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom — for freedom. And we know, in America, freedom is not to be given. It is not to be bestowed. It is ours by right. (Applause.) It is ours by right, and that includes the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.) Yes, we must trust women. And we all know how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court — the court of Thurgood and RBG — with the intention that they would overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. And now more than 20 states have Trump abortion bans — extremists that have passed laws that criminalize health care providers, doctors and nurses, and punish women. In two states of those states, they provide for prison for life — prison for life for health care providers for simply providing reproductive care, the care they so earnestly and rightly believe must be delivered. All Trump abortion bans. And think about this: Many of these bans make no exception even for rape and incest. Now, many of you know I started my career as a prosecutor specializing in crimes of violence against women and children. What many of you may not know is why. So, when I was in high school, my best friend, I learned, was being molested by her stepfather. And I said to her, ""Look, you've got to come and stay with us."" I called my mother. She said, ""Of course she does."" And she came and she stayed with us. And so, I made the decision early in my life that I wanted to do the work that was about protecting the most vulnerable among us and doing the work that was about giving them dignity in the process. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. THE VICE PRESIDENT: And so — well, thank everybody here for being here, standing in solidarity around the importance of that. (Applause.) And so, I say to you, then, from that experience and from the work that I've done, the idea that someone who survives a crime of violence to their body — a violation of their body — would not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, that's immoral. That's immoral. And let us agree, and I know we do: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. (Applause.) If she chooses — if she chooses, she will talk with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her imam. But it should not be the government or Donald Trump telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.) And think about it — the stories that Dr. Reddick shares with us, the stories we heard last night, the stories we've been hearing for two years. One in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban. This includes Georgia and every state in the South except Virginia. Think about that when you also combine that with what we know has been long-standing neglect around an issue like maternal mortality. Think about that when you compound that with what has been long-standing neglect of women in communities with a lack of the adequate resources they need for health care — prenatal, during their pregnancy, postpartum. Think about that. And these hypocrites want to start talking about ""this is in the best interest of women and children."" (Applause.) Well, where you been? Where you been — (applause) — when it comes to taking care of the women and children of America? Where you been? How dare they? How dare they? Come on. And — and we understand the impact of these bans and the horrific reality that women and families — their husbands, their partners, their parents, their children are facing as a consequence every single day. Since Roe was overturned, I have met women who were refused care during a miscarriage — wanted to have a child, suffering a miscarriage. I met a woma- — a woman — I've actually met several who were turned away from the emergency room. One, at early stages after the Dobbs decision came down, told me with tears — she was with her husband — about how only when she developed ses- — sepsis did she receive emergency care. Only when she developed sepsis did she receive emergency care. And now we know that at least two women — and those are only the stories we know — here in the state of Georgia died — died because of a Trump abortion ban. One — and we heard about her story last night — a vibrant, 28-year-old young woman. She was ambitious. You know, we — I talked with her mother and her sisters about her, and they described such an extraordinary life of a person. She was excited. She was working hard. She was a medical assistant. She was going to nursing school, raising her six-year-old son. She was really proud that she had finally worked so hard that she gained the independence. Her family was telling me that she was able to get an apartment in a gated community with a pool for her son to play in. She was so proud, and she was headed to nursing school. And her name — and we will speak her name — AUDIENCE: Yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Amber Nicole Thurman. AUDIENCE: Amber Nicole Thurman. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Amber Nicole Thurman. AUDIENCE: Amber Nicole Thurman. THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. And she had her future all planned out, and it was her plan. You know, let's understand — just take pause on that for a moment. She had her plan, what she wanted to do for her son, for herself, for their future. And so, when she discovered that she was pregnant, she decided she wanted to have an abortion, but because of the Trump abortion ban here in Georgia, she was forced to travel out of state to receive the health care that she needed. But when she returned to Georgia, she needed additional care, so she went to a hospital. But, you see, under the Trump abortion ban, her doctors could have faced up to a decade in prison for providing Amber the care she needed. Understand what a law like this means. Doctors have to wait until the patient is at death's door before they take action. You know, on the other side of my — you know, the — the other folks, th- — Trump and his running mate, and they'll talk about, (deepens voice) ""Oh, well, yeah, but I — you know, I — I do believe in the exception to save the mother's life."" (Laughter.) Okay. All right. Let's break that down. Shall we? AUDIENCE: Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let's break that down. (Applause.) Let's break that down. So, we're saying that we're going to create public policy that says that a doctor, a health care provider, will only kick in to give the care that somebody needs if they're about to die? Think about what we are saying right now. You're saying that good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy, is about saying that a health care provider will only start providing that care when you're about to die? And so, Amber waited 20 hours — 20 hours, excruciating hours — until finally she was in enough physical distress that her doctors thought they would be okay to treat her. But it was too late. She died of sepsis. And her last words to her mother — which her mother, as you know, tears up and cries every time she speaks it — last words to her mother, ""Promise me you'll take care of my son."" So, I met last night and I spent time with Amber's mother and her sisters, and they spoke about Amber — a daughter, a sister, a mother — with the deep love that you can imagine and how terribly they miss her. And their pain is heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking. Amber's mother, Shanette, told me that the word ""preventable"" is over and over again in her head when she learned about how her child died — the word ""preventable."" She cannot — she can't stop thinking about the word that they spoke to her. It was ""preventable."" Because, you see, medical experts have now determined that Amber's death was preventable. And through the pain and the grief of her mother, who courageously told her story, I promised her, as she has asked, that we will make sure Amber is not just remembered as a statistic — (applause) — that she will not just be remembered as a statistic, so that people will know she was a mother and a daughter and a sister and that she was loved and that she should be alive today — (applause) — and that she should be alive today. And many of us remember — there's so many leaders here — from two years ago when the Dobbs decision came down, we knew this could happen. There is a word ""preventable,"" and there is another word: predictable. AUDIENCE: Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And the reality is for every story we hear of the suffering under Trump abortion bans, there are so many other stories we're not hearing but where suffering is happening every day in our country, an untold number of people suffering. Women who are also being made to feel as though they did something wrong. The judgment factor here is outrageous — being made as though to feel as though they are criminals, as though they are alone. So, to those women, to those families, I say on behalf of what I believe we all say: We see you, and you are not alone, and we are all here standing with you. (Applause.) Standing with you. You are not alone. You are not alone. (Applause.) So, Georgia — AUDIENCE MEMBER: We will not be silent. THE VICE PRESIDENT: We — and we will not be silent. AUDIENCE: We will not be silent. THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we will not be silent. But this is a health care crisis. AUDIENCE: Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT: This is a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect of this crisis. He brags about overturning Roe v. Wade. In his own words, quote, ""I did it, and I'm proud to have done it,"" he says. He is proud. Proud that women are dying? Proud that doctors and nurses could be thrown in prison for administering care? Proud that young women today have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers? How dare he? How dare he? And in our debate last week — (laughter and applause). Well, that was fun. (Laughs.) But — and I know everyone here paid attention to the words, though — the words, right? AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) I'm trying to get another debate. We'll see. (Laughter.) But in our debate last week, remember when he said: Everyone wanted Roe v. Wade to be overturned. AUDIENCE MEMBER: I don't know where ""everyone"" is. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, exactly. I don't know where everyone is either, because — (laughter and applause) — women have been arrested and charged for miscarriages. They didn't want that. AUDIENCE: No! THE VICE PRESIDENT: I — I was speaking with a physician who is here, who has, in her professional experience, been administering care to girls. And what we know is that 12- and 13-year-old survivors of assault are being forced to carry a pregnancy to term. They didn't want this. AUDIENCE: No! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And couples just trying to grow their family being cut off in the middle of IVF treatments, they didn't want this. AUDIENCE: No! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on that last point, you probably saw, this week, for the second time, Republicans in the United States Senate blocked a bill that would protect access to IVF treatment. Now, consider among the multitude of ironies the fact that, on the one hand, these extremists want to tell women they don't have the freedom to end an unwanted pregnancy, and on the other hand, these extremists are telling women and their partners they don't have the freedom to start a family. Okay. And they want to restrict access to contraception as well. And now Donald Trump says that he would personally cast his vote in Florida, which is where he now lives, to support their extreme abortion ban, just like the one that is here in Georgia. And — AUDIENCE MEMBER: Felons can't vote! (Laughter and applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, that's a whole different policy discussion that we'll have for another day. (Laughter.) But let's understand, if he is — if he is elected again as president, Donald Trump will go further. (Applause.) But we know what we're up against, and we must — we must speak of the stakes. We must remind — everybody here knows, but we got to remind our friends, our neighbors, our coworkers: The stakes are so high. Because, if he is elected again, I am certain he will sign a national abortion ban, which would outlaw abortion in every single state. And he would create a national anti-abortion coordinator — look at Project 2025 — and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions. It's right there. I can't believe they put that Project 2025 in writing. (Laughter.) I — I — they — they put it — they literally put it in writing. They bound it. (Laughter.) They handed it out. I mean, they are simply out of their minds. (Laughter and applause.) And it's clear that they just don't trust women. AUDIENCE: They don't. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we trust women. We trust women. (Applause.) And like Dr. Reddick said, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will so proudly sign it back into law. (Applause.) I will so proudly sign it into law. Proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) So, 46 days to go. And let us remember that momentum on this and so many issues — momentum is on our side. (Applause.) Let's remember, since Roe was overturned, every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot — from Kansas to California to Kentucky; in Michigan, Montana, Vermont, and Ohio — the people of America have voted for freedom. (Applause.) The people of America have voted for freedom — and not just by a little but by overwhelming margins, from so-called red states to so-called blue states, providing and making clear, also, this is not a partisan issue. This is not a partisan issue. And it is proving that the voice of the people has been heard and will be heard again — and will be heard again. (Applause.) So, 46 days to go in probably the most consequential election of our lifetime. And with that, then, today, I ask: Georgia, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we trust women? (Applause.) Do we believe in reproductive freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.) And when we fight — AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win. (Applause.) God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for being here. (Applause.)","","",""

WINFREY: So, welcome to -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oprah -- MS. WINFREY: Oh, hello! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi. (Laughs.) MS. WINFREY: Madam Vice President, hello. Welcome to Michigan. THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's so good to be back. And, Governor, thank you for everything you are and everything you do for this state. Thank you. (Applause.) MS. WINFREY: Well -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. MS. WINFREY: Can you see this? We have a thousand -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh, my goodness. MS. WINFREY: -- screens here -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oh, my goodness. MS. WINFREY: -- representing people from all over the country. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, everyone. Oh, my goodness. MS. WINFREY: Can you feel -- can you feel -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes. MS. WINFREY: Can you feel it? Can you feel -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: I can. MS. WINFREY: -- the joy rising in here? THE VICE PRESIDENT: I can. And I -- I have to tell you, there is so much that I love about our campaign, because it really is about the people. And I look around at these screens, Oprah, I look at who's in the room, and this is America. MS. WINFREY: This is. THE VICE PRESIDENT: This is America. You know, I was saying with a group of friends earlier: I think, in this moment, where we've dealt with so much that I think is quite exhausting around powerful forces that would try and divide us -- MS. WINFREY: Yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and try us -- to have us, as Americans, pointing fingers at each other -- MS. WINFREY: Yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- that this movement that is about reminding each other that we have so much more in common than what separates us is so critically important, and this is about the strength of who we are as Americans. And this movement that we're in about, as I like to say, seeing in the face of a stranger, a neighbor. MS. WINFREY: Yes, yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right? MS. WINFREY: Yes, yes, yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: An extension of ""love thy neighbor,"" that you literally, in the face of a stranger, see a neighbor -- MS. WINFREY: Yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and approach each other with that level of dignity and grace and -- and kindness. MS. WINFREY: Well, that's exactly what happened with -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know? MS. WINFREY: -- Win With Black Women. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes. MS. WINFREY: I know you've known Jotaka -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Jotaka. MS. WINFREY: -- for many years. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, my dear. Oh. MS. WINFREY: Well, that's exactly what happened -- (applause) -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: She started it. MS. WINFREY: -- tha- -- is that they had this big call -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Jotaka started it. MS. WINFREY: They had the big call -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's your fault. (Laughs.) MS. WINFREY: They had the big call and then said, ""Let's open the door."" THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. MS. WINFREY: ""Let's open the door and invite everybody else in."" And everybody actually came. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Organically. MS. WINFREY: Yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Organically. MS. WINFREY: Yeah. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Like, this is the beauty of our country. I -- you know, there's so much at stake in this election, and, ultimately, the question before us is: What kind of country do we want to live in? And the beauty of a democracy -- as long as we can hold on to it -- the beauty of a democracy is each of us has the power -- MS. WINFREY: That's right. THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- each of us has the power -- MS. WINFREY: That's right. That's right. THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- to answer that question. MS. WINFREY: That's right. Everybody -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right? MS. WINFREY: -- on this call and beyond has the power. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. MS. WINFREY: But can I just start with this? THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, please. MS. WINFREY: I have to say this, because in all of my private conversations -- Gayle and I have said this a hundred times -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. MS. WINFREY: Ev- -- and everybody is saying it. You all have said it. I know you have. It seems to us that something happened to you the moment Joe Biden -- President Biden stepped aside and withdrew his candidacy, that a veil or something dropped, and you just stepped into your power. (Applause.) I mean, literally, looking at you at a speech like the week before, which was a great speech, very nice -- (laughter) -- and then the next week -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Oprah. (Laughs.) MS. WINFREY: -- I saw you walking in the thing -- (Oprah struts around the stage) -- (laughter and applause) -- and I said, ""What happened to you?"" THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know, we each have those moments in our lives where it's time to step up. MS. WINFREY: Time to step up. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Time to step up, you know. (Applause.) MS. WINFREY: Well, the moment you heard -- I mean, I really have been saying to people, it felt like a veil dropped, and you sort of stepped through that veil. Did -- did that actually -- did you feel like that? THE VICE PRESIDENT: I felt a sense of responsibility, to be honest with you. And with that, comes a sense of purpose. But, I mean, we're all here, and you all are taking time out of your busy lives -- everyone here, everyone on the screen -- because there really is so much at stake. You know, I have spent the majority of my career being concerned about the well-being of other people. MS. WINFREY: Yeah. THE VICE PRESIDENT: As I have said, my career as a prosecutor, I never looked at a -- a victim or a witness and asked them, ""Are you a Republican or a Democrat?"" The only thing I ever asked them is, ""Are you okay?"" MS. WINFREY: ""Are you okay?"" I know, when I heard that -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know? MS. WINFREY: -- it touched me. THE VICE PRESIDENT: And traveling this country and knowing what is at stake in terms of fundamental freedoms, what's at stake in terms of fighting against hate and those -- those efforts to divide us, and I do know that I am in a position to do something about it. So, I felt a great responsibility and -- and the incredible power of the people -- right? -- who -- and I'm not the only leader in this. We're all leaders in this. This is so much bigger than me. It's about who we are as Americans, and it's about making clear what we stand for. And what we stand for is it is about the ideals upon which we were founded, including the importance of freedom and -- and the importance of independence and -- and the importance of dignity and -- and purpose, but it is also about what we stand for in terms of our values. I -- I think of it this way -- MS. WINFREY: Yeah, I think a lot boils down to values. I just said: Values are -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: It really does. MS. WINFREY: -- on the line here. Yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: It does. I mean, think about it, Oprah. The idea that some would suggest and that my opponent and -- suggests, which is that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down -- come on. The real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. And it's -- it's important for us -- (applause) -- MS. WINFREY: Absolutely. And, you know -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- to articulate that. MS. WINFREY: You know, ever since the debate, we feel for our fellow citizens in Springfield. Do you not -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. MS. WINFREY: -- think about the fellow citizens in Springfield, Ohio; the Haitian families; the -- the non-Haitian families; everybody having to deal with this lie that has endangered the lives of Haitian people and anybody who looks Haitian? Everybody in America feels for that. And I -- also, everybody in America -- left, right, middle -- has concerns about immigration. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. MS. WINFREY: And I'm told that Justin -- Justin, where are you in the audience? Justin -- PARTICIPANT: Hello. MS. WINFREY: -- in our audience. PARTICIPANT: Hello, Madam Vice President. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, Justin. MS. WINFREY: You live in Michigan? PARTICIPANT: Yes, ma'am. MS. WINFREY: Don't you love saying, ""Hello, Madam Vice President""? (Laughter.) PARTICIPANT: I do. I do. MS. WINFREY: What's -- what's your question? It's an immigration question, I was told. PARTICIPANT: My question for you is: When you become president, what would be your specific steps -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: With your help. (Laughter.) PARTICIPANT: Yeah, of course. What would be your specific steps to strengthening the border? THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, it's a wonderful and important question. I -- you know my background was as a prosecutor, and I was also the elected attorney general for two terms of a border state. So, this is not a theoretical issue for me. This is something I've actually worked on. PARTICIPANT: Okay. THE VICE PRESIDENT: I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. I take very seriously the importance of having a secure border and ensuring the safety of the American people. Sadly, where we are now can be traced most recently back to the fact that when the United States Congress -- members of the Congress, including some of the most conservative Republicans, came up with a border security bill -- and here's what that border security bill would have done: It would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border. And let me tell you, those border agents are working around the clock. It would have just been about giving them some support and relief, which is probably why the border agents actually endorsed the bill. It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl. And I'm looking at people from all over the country here, so I don't need to tell the folks who are watching this what fentanyl has done to families, to -- to kids in our country, and the need to take seriously stemming the flow coming into our country and addressing that extraordinary and -- and tragic issue in terms of its effect. The bill would have allowed us to have more resources to prosecute transnational criminal organizations, and it would have been part of the solution. And Donald Trump called up those folks and said, ""Don't put that bill on the floor for a vote."" He blocked the bill. And you know why? PARTICIPANT: Why? THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because he'd prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. (Applause.) And he has put his politil -- personal political security before border security. Because understand, even in the intervening months, what that bill would have done to give support to folks who care about this issue. And this, again, gets to the point about what does leadership really look like, and is it about you or is it about the people? PARTICIPANT: Right. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Is it about running on problems or fixing problems? My work and my career has always been about saying, ""Let's fix problems."" MS. WINFREY: So -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let's address the needs, because we know it's within our capacity to do that. MS. WINFREY: So, to answer Justin's question, now that that bill has gone and hasn't passed, will you reintroduce that? THE VICE PRESIDENT: Absolutely. And when I am elected president of the United States, I will make sure that bill gets to my desk, and I will sign it into law. (Applause.) MS. WINFREY: Thank you, Justin. PARTICIPANT: Thank you. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Justin. MS. WINFREY: Listen to this. A majority of young Americans, 18 to 34, say that the cost of living is their top issue ahead of the election. Let's take a look. (A video is played.) Well, Rachael and Garrett are joining us on Zoom from Pennsylvania. And I understand your sister and brother-in-law moved in, and you're hoping to save money to have a second child. PARTICIPANT: (Via teleconference.) That's right. Hi, Oprah. Hi, Madam Vice President. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, guys. PARTICIPANT: It's nice to be with you all. MS. WINFREY: Yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi. MS. WINFREY: And so -- PARTICIPANT: (Inaudible.) MS. WINFREY: -- what did -- what did you want to say to the vice president? PARTICIPANT: So, Madam Vice Predi- -- President, we are, like many, many young Americans, just experiencing a very high cost of living. We ended up giving up our apartment, moving in with our parents, who were so gracious to take us in for over a year so that we could save money and ultimately buy a home, because that's what we thought the American dream was: to -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yep. Yeah. PARTICIPANT: -- to get married and buy a home and have a baby. And now, here we are, and our mortgage is incredibly higher than what we thought it would be. And my sister and our brother-in-law are living with us right now so that they can hopefully one day do the same. And while it's beneficial for us because they help us pay off some of our mortgage, it's also beneficial for them because they can save on cheaper rent. But we really would love to know what your plan is to help lower the cost of living. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. I -- first of all, thank you both for being here. And yours is a -- a story I hear around the country as I travel, and in terms of both rightly having the right to have aspirations and dreams and ambitions for your family and working hard and finding that the American dream is, for this generation and so many recently, far more elusive than it's been. And we need to deal with that, and there are a number of ways. One is bringing down the cost of everyday necessities, including groceries. So, that's why I'm taking on, for example, price gouging, which is when -- you know, most companies and corporations are good, but for those bad ones, they take advantage of people, especially during a pandemic or extreme weather, and they end up jacking up prices. And there needs to be accountability and consequence for that. So, I'm going to be taking on price gouging. But it's also about dealing with what we need to do around homeownership, right? So, as someone mentioned during this -- this film -- look, I grew up a child of a mother who worked very hard. She raised me and my sister. And she saved up, and by the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy a home. And we grew up, actually, for a long time, in an apartment on top of a childcare center that was owned by the woman we called our second mother, because she helped my mother raise us, and she was a small business owner: Ms. Shelton. So, I'll bring all this together to tell you: The way I think about it is, one, when people work hard and have a dream of buying a home, we should give you the opportunity to be able to do that, which is why part of my plan is for first-time homeowners -- -buyers to have a $25,000 down payment assistance to buy your first home. Because people just need -- (applause) -- to be able to get their foot in the door, and then you'll do the hard work. Part of my plan is what we need to do to support small businesses, because my second mother was a small-business owner. And I love our small businesses and our small-business owners. They are not only business leaders, they are community leaders. They -- they mentor; they hire locally. And we have so many entrepreneurs in our country who have great ideas, incredible work ethic, but not necessarily access to capital, because not everybody, like my opponent, was handed $400 million on a silver plate that he filed bankruptcy six times on. (Laughter.) And so, part of my plan is to give start-up small businesses a $50,000 tax deduction to start up their small business. Right now, it's $5,000. Nobody can start a small business with $5,000. So, that's part of my plan. MS. WINFREY: It's -- that's a teeny-tiny business. (Laughter.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's -- that -- that's business in -- MS. WINFREY: $5,000 -- teeny-tiny business. THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's a concept of a business. Right? (Laughter.) MS. WINFREY: Yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know where I'm going. (Laughs.) MS. WINFREY: That's right. THE VICE PRESIDENT: And part of -- MS. WINFREY: It's still on paper with the $5,000. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. Right. MS. WINFREY: It's still on paper. THE VICE PRESIDENT: It just hasn't happened. But -- MS. WINFREY: Right. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Part of the -- to speak to you guys and your family and your dreams -- is what we need to do around giving middle-class families tax breaks. And so, part of my plan is also to ext- -- extend and expand the Child Tax Credit to $6,000, so that you can, in the first year of your child's life, have the resources to be able to buy a crib and a car seat and -- and clothes for your baby, knowing that's such an extraordinarily important time in their development and you shouldn't have to worry about how you're going to take care of their basic needs. All of this and more is part of what I plan to build, and I call it an opportunity economy. And it's basically about creating opportunities, knowing so many people have the ambition, have the aspirations, are working hard, but just need opportunity to reach their goals and their dreams. MS. WINFREY: I saw you smiling with that $25,000 credit for the home. I saw that smile on your face -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) MS. WINFREY: -- and the $6,000. Thank you all so much. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you, guys. MS. WINFREY: I want to just introduce you to Shelby, who's also in our virtual audience. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. MS. WINFREY: Thank you, guys. Shelby from Virginia, who's also struggling with the cost of living. Tell us your story, Shelby. Why? PARTICIPANT: (Via teleconference.) Hi. Hi, Madam Vice President. Hi, Oprah. I'm 24 years old. I'm a graduate student living with my parents, and I want to move out next year and potentially buy a home. And I'm concerned about the affordability of one -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. PARTICIPANT: -- with the extra cost and bills that I'm paying now, along with the bills and costs I will pay in the future too. And so, everything just has a cost and everything is so expensive. And so, I'm worried about my capacity and how I'm able to fully support myself once I do live independently. MS. WINFREY: You sound like one of my daughter girls from South Africa. Graduated -- she was like, ""I hate adulting."" (Laughter.) ""I hate adulting."" THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. MS. WINFREY: ""This adulting isn't going so well."" Yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, so par- -- first of all, congratulations on all the success you've already achieved. And it is -- your story and the story of our friends before you is really -- that's the American story, right? You -- you are working hard, you have goals, you have ambitions. And so, part of it is, again, the $25,000 down-payment assistance. Part of it is what we need to do to also push back against a very different vision for our country. Because, look, in this election, there are two very different visions for our country: One, for me, that is focused on the future, including you; and another that is focused on the past. What Donald Trump -- what my opponent plans on doing for the economy is doing what he did the last time he was president, and giving another tax break for billionaires and the biggest corporations that would add $5 trillion to our deficit. And get this. He plans on what -- doing what I call a ""Trump sales tax,"" which is, basically, he's going to put a 20 percent tax on everyday necessities that economists have estimated will cost the average American $4,000 more a year -- which is why Goldman Sachs, which is why Moody's, which is why Wharton School of Business, which is why 16 Nobel laureates have collectively determined after analyzing our plans, one, mine would strengthen the economy, his would weaken it; two, that on his plan, he would actually blow up inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. So, when you think about the cost of living, my approach is about lifting you up. His would be about actually weakening our economy. And I feel very strongly when an individual, when a small business, when a family, when the middle class is strong, America is strong. MS. WINFREY: Amen to that. Amen to that. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right? MS. WINFREY: Thank you, Shelby. Thank you, Rachael and Garrett. So, the Harris campaign kicked off the Fighting for Reproductive Freedom bus tour to support the fundamental right for women to make decisions about our own bodies. And here is a short tape on that. (A video is played.) So, for the millions of you who watched the Democratic National Convention, you will remember Hadley Duvall telling her incredibly powerful story. And in case you didn't see it, here's just a brief look. (A video is played.) Hadley is here. THE VICE PRESIDENT: There's Hadley. MS. WINFREY: Stand up, Hadley. (Applause.) I have to tell you, we are all standing up because we are so impressed by your courage to stand up and share your story. Where did that come from, the strength to -- to do this? Because I'm sure you thought long and hard before deciding to go public with your story. PARTICIPANT: When Roe v. Wade was overturned -- MS. WINFREY: Thanks, everybody. PARTICIPANT: -- I woke up with a harsh reality of my abuse was over but my story is not. And I just could not fathom thinking about the other Hadleys out there that don't have that choice, that don't have somebody to go to. So, being able to find courage and be the light for them, that's -- that's really what I do it for. MS. WINFREY: And so, what do you want to say to other people who are voting in this election regarding what happened to you and what that means? PARTICIPANT: You can't wait until it's too late to care about reproductive health care, because then it's too late. And when it affects you, it -- it hits, and it -- you can't deny it. You can't look at someone with a story like mine and say it didn't happen. And there are more people like me out there, and there are going to be so many more who deserve their options. They deserve their choices. Let's get involved. We have someone who's willing to hear us at a level like never before. We have someone who wants to know what we want in this country. We have someone who wants to lift up our voice, and we need to show out and show up for her, just like she's showing out and showing up for us. (Applause.) MS. WINFREY: All right. Is there something wanted to say to Madam Vice President? PARTICIPANT: Madam Vice President, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for seeing us, for hearing us when the Supreme Court won't. Thank you for fighting and, you know, really showing us that life is -- is not about the hard things that you go through. You don't bow down -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. PARTICIPANT: -- even when you're the underdog -- especially when you're the underdog -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. PARTICIPANT: -- you stand up and you stand tall. And you give me so much hope and so much strength. And thank you. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Aw, Hadley. Honestly -- MS. WINFREY: Thank you, Hadley, for coming all this way. I hope you continue to use your voice. I hope you continue that. This week, the case of a young woman who lost her life after the abortion ban took place in Georgia made national headlines. Amber's case came to light through the reporting of journalist Kavitha Surana with Pro- -- ProPublica. And so, listen to her story. (A video is played.) Amber's mother, Shanette, and older sisters C.J. and Andrika are here, and they -- are they wanted to be here tonight to speak out for the first time. Ms. Shanette, what do you want us to know about Amber's story? PARTICIPANT: Initially, I did not want the public to know my pain. I wanted to go through it in silence, but I realized that it was selfish. I want y'all to know Amber was not a statistic. She was loved by a family -- a strong family, and we would have done whatever to get my baby, our baby, the help that she needed. When ProPublica came to my home, I pushed them away. ""No. No. No."" But Kavitha, she kept -- she was persistent. She said it was something that you needed to know; you have to hear me: Women around the world, people around the world, need to know that this was preventable. Two years later, after speaking with my daughters -- because I lost strength; I lost hope -- you're looking at a mother that is broken. The worst pain ever that a mother, that a parent could ever feel -- her father and myself and the family -- you're looking at it. MS. WINFREY: Well, we appreciate so deeply you being here. And I -- we're all watching you hear that tape and those words. We know how re-traumatizing that is and the strength it takes for you to be here to tell your story, and we deeply appreciate it. And I have to ask you, as her sisters, how are you coping? And what does knowing that this could have been prevented -- how does -- how does that sit with you? How do you cope with that on a daily basis? PARTICIPANT: I mean, it's heartbreaking. You know, that was my baby sister. I loved my baby sister, you know? I'm beyond hurt. I'm disappointed. I feel guilty. I wish I could have helped her, you know, because she was suffering. And we had no idea. We trusted them to take care of her, you know? And they just let her die because -- because of some stupid abortion ban. They treated her like she was just another number. They didn't care for her as if, you know, she was their daughter or their, you know, granddaughter. MS. WINFREY: Yeah. PARTICIPANT: You know, and she's not here. She'll never come back. MS. WINFREY: Yeah. Andrika, what do you want to say? PARTICIPANT: I want to say that it's -- it's very disheartening that my sister was allowed to suffer for 20 hours. She suffered. There was nothing that we could do to help her. We trusted the health care professionals to do their job and save her, but they failed her. MS. WINFREY: Well, I think the most powerful thing that you've said here, Ms. Shanette, is that your daughter is not a statistic. She had a life. She was loved by her sisters, loved by her family, loved by those who knew her. And she's not just a tis- -- statistic. And we are happy to speak her name tonight. In -- in this room, talking about what this country needs in terms of reproductive rights and freedom, what do you want to say, Madam Vice President? THE VICE PRESIDENT: I'm just so sorry. And the courage that you all have shown is extraordinary, because also you just learned about how it is that she died. And -- MS. WINFREY: They just recently learned, yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: How, yeah. MS. WINFREY: Yeah, yeah. THE VICE PRESIDENT: And -- and Amber's mom shared with me that the word over and over again in her mind is ""preventable."" MS. WINFREY: Yeah. THE VICE PRESIDENT: ""Preventable."" That word keeps coming to her. And this story is a story that is, sadly, not the only story of what has been happening since these bans have taken place. And, you know, so the -- just to step back in terms of how we got here. The former president chose three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would overdo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. And in state after state, including yours, these abortion bans have been passed that criminalize health care providers. In a couple of states, prison for life, Oprah -- prison for life in a couple of states for a doctor or nurse who provides health care. And so, it -- it seems very apparent that -- MS. WINFREY: Even when the -- even when the mother's life is in danger. THE VICE PRESIDENT: But see, here's the problem with that. Here's the problem with that. So, is she on death's door before you actually decide to give her help? MS. WINFREY: Mm-hmm. That's the problem. (Applause.) That's the problem. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Is that what we're saying? MS. WINFREY: Yeah. That you've got to prove -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: That -- MS. WINFREY: -- you're on death's door. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Like, literally, a doctor or a nurse has to say, ""She might die any minute. Better give her now care, because otherwise I might go to prison for life,"" in some cla- -- cases. Think about what we're doing in terms of saying that certain people who are in these state houses -- and then starting with the former president of the United States -- think they're in a better position than a doctor or a nurse to determine when their patient needs medical care. This literally -- and -- and Amber's story highlights the fact that among everything that is wrong with these bans and what has happened in terms of the overturning of Wa- -- Roe v. Wade, it's a health care crisis. It's a health care crisis that affects the patient and the profession. And going back to Hadley's story -- and, Hadley, you've been so remarkable -- PARTICIPANT: Thank you. THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- in telling your story and being so strong in the way you do it. And both of these stories -- really, I mean, the courage for -- out of pain, for you to tell these stories to help other people is e- -- is just extraordinary. It's -- and, Hadley, and -- and I'm -- you just -- you've been so remarkable. You know, I -- Oprah, I don't know if you know this, but when I was in high school, I learned that my best friend was being molested by her stepfather. MS. WINFREY: Yes. Yes. We heard that story on the -- at the DNC, yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. MS. WINFREY: Yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: And -- and I said to her -- MS. WINFREY: And you had the courage then to go to her and say, ""You've got to come"" -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: ""You come"" -- MS. WINFREY: -- ""to our house."" THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- ""you have to come"" -- yeah. And she came to stay with us. I called my mother, and she came to stay with us. And the idea that these same legislators who would be saying, you know, ""criminalize health care providers"" are also saying that after a person's body has been violated, that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next -- that's immoral. MS. WINFREY: Yeah. (Applause.) I think it -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's immoral. MS. WINFREY: -- it's not just i","mmoral. And here's -- here's what I want to say: I just don't believe that those legislators, that the government has a right to be in your womb. They have no right to be in your womb with decisions about your womb. THE VICE PRESIDENT: And one does not have to abandon their faith -- MS. WINFREY: Right. THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. (Applause.) MS. WINFREY: Absolutely. Absolutely. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right? If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, or her imam, but not the government telling her what's in her be- -- best interest. MS. WINFREY: Well, this is a long healing process for this family, and we thank you, and we hope that by being amongst people who heard you and heard your daughter's story will be meaningful to you in this journey to healing. Thank you so much for being here. Okay, I want to also -- (applause). Thank you. I want to hear from Star Walker, who is a campaign engagement organizer in Milwaukee -- one of my hometowns, Milwaukee. Hi, Star. What's going on in Wisconsin? PARTICIPANT: (Via teleconference.) Hi, Oprah. Hi, Madam Vice President. We are fired up here in Wisconsin. I'm an engagement organizer, so I'm focused on (inaudible) -- (applause) -- within their personal networks, as friends, family, teammates. Yeah, and by empowering people to leverage their relationships, we amplify their voices and deliver progress. We're fired up, but we also know it's a razor-thin race. So, just like in 2020, this is going to be won by a field margin. It's on us to roll up our sleeves and do the work. Let's make phone calls and knock on doors. Go to Go.KamalaHarris.com to join this people-powered movement. That way, when we look back, we won't just be remembering how we felt, we'll be remembering what we did. Thank you. (Applause.) MS. WINFREY: Wooo! I love that. I love that. Y'all, I love that. That's a big takeaway, because we are feeling really good right now, but it -- what really matters is: What are we going to do? THE VICE PRESIDENT: Absolutely. MS. WINFREY: What are we going to do? Thank you so much, Star. I see somebody else on the screen. Julia Roberts! Hi, Julia. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, Julia. MS. ROBERTS: (Via teleconference.) Hi. Hi. MS. WINFREY: I heard you were so excited; you wanted to be here tonight. Why? MS. ROBERTS: Well, first of all, Oprah, thank you for hosting this, because, I guess, if I started a voting club, it would be ""Conversationalists for Kamala"" -- MS. WINFREY: Yes. Yes. (Laughter.) MS. ROBERTS: -- because to -- to talk, to -- to listen, to be heard, to have this back-and-forth is so unique in this campaign to beautiful, wonderful Kamala Harris, who I have had the good fortune of knowing for many years. And I am a mother of two kids. This is their first chance to vote in an election -- (applause) -- and I couldn't be more excited for them to have the legacy to say that their first vote they ever cast for president was for you. I have just chills saying that out loud. MS. WINFREY: Are you all going to the polls together? Are you organizing a party? Are the Moders -- MS. ROBERTS: We -- MS. WINFREY: -- having a poll party? What's happening? MS. ROBERTS: (Laughs.) I wish we were all going together. In fact, you know, they are in college, so we will be separated on the great day. But -- but in spirit, united always for what we believe in and what we -- You know, I feel like it's interesting. We talk so much about being Americans united for something, but this has become such a global representation of our country and what we stand for. And I get to travel internationally a lot, and I want people to say, ""Oh, you're American"" and not ""Oh. Huh. How's it going over there?"" (Laughter.) You know? MS. WINFREY: Yes. MS. ROBERTS: So, I want to get back to that space. (Applause.) MS. WINFREY: Exactly. MS. ROBERTS: And I -- and I just -- MS. WINFREY: Thank you, Julia. Exactly. Thank you. And, hey, there's Tracee Ellis Ross coming up there. Tracee, we sh- -- now, listen -- MS. ROSS: (Via teleconference.) Hi. MS. WINFREY: If anybody should have a voting party, I think it should be at your house, because you have great parties, girl. (Laughter.) MS. ROSS: I just want to say hi. Hello, Madam Vice President. It -- Ma- -- Ma- -- it's just an honor. I actually have never met you -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: I know. MS. ROSS: -- which is -- which is crazy. And hi, Oprah. (Laughter.) I am here because -- wait, what did I miss? MS. WINFREY: You go -- she go- -- we just saw each other the other day. Okay. (Laughter.) Oh, hi, Tracee. Hi. MS. ROSS: We did. Hi, Oprah. How are you doing? MS. WINFREY: Good. (Laughs.) Yeah. MS. ROSS: Okay. MS. WINFREY: This is exciting, though, isn't it? Isn't it exciting? MS. ROSS: It's exciting. It's exciting because I believe in democracy. I believe in the future of our country, in reproductive freedom, bodily autonomy, women leading. I believe in decency. The idea of leading with joy and kindness has always been in my DNA. And I'm here both for the seriousness of this election but the joy with which it is being handled. It is stunning. And then, I -- I also really want to remind everybody -- it hasn't been mentioned -- but voting up and down the ballot -- (applause) -- is incredibly important. Your freedom and your daily life are -- are all the way up and down that ballot. People are policies, and we need the right people in all areas -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. MS. ROSS: -- all -- all positions. And then, I would like to say to you two women: Thank you for what you represent, because as a 52-year-old childless woman, I want to say to the people who think that a woman's worth is measured in her baby count -- I mean, shout out to all the amazing mothers -- but the childless women have been mothering the world and elevating culture -- (applause) -- as aunties, godmothers, teachers, mentors, sisters, and friends and the list go- -- goes on, and you do not need to push out a baby to help push humanity forward. MS. WINFREY: Amen to that. Thank you so much. Tracee Ellis Ross. (Applause.) Thank you so much. So, another important issue of this election is, of course, our safety. And just two weeks ago, our country experienced yet another horrific school shooting. Watch this. (A video is played.) We live in a country where 383,000 children have been exposed to gun violence. Now just sit with that number for a second. It's a number until it's your child. This is not normal, y'all. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. MS. WINFREY: This is not normal, and this is not right. Other people in other countries do not have this issue. We -- Americans, we have to do better. We have to do better. (Applause.) We cannot continue to just settle for your ""our thoughts and prayers."" Lives are being destroyed. THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. MS. WINFREY: Fifteen-year-old Natalie Griffith and her parents, Doug and Marilda, are here. And, Natalie, we are so sorry to know that you, too, have been added to that number because you were in algebra class when you were shot twice by a 14-year-old fellow student. We're so glad that you lived to tell your story. And so, how are you tonight? PARTICIPANT: Well, before that thing -- the video, I was ver- -- I was very happy. I still am very happy to be here and to -- and to tell my story and what hap- -- and what happened, because it was a terrible thing, and it should -- and it should not have -- what's it called -- PARTICIPANT: Never happened. MS. WINFREY: Where were you shot? Where were you physically shot? PARTICIPANT: I was right here on my shoulder, and then around here, right -- PARTICIPANT: Her wrist. PARTICIPANT: -- around my wrist. MS. WINFREY: I was saying that 383,000 students in our country, the United States of America, have been -- been exposed to violence -- that same scene that you experienced in your school. Had you all been having, you know, drills or preparation -- PARTICIPANT: Yes. MS. WINFREY: -- for what should happen should there be a shooting? PARTICIPANT: We have -- I've had intruder drills and fire drills and stuff in my old schools. We had -- we have had a fire drill at Apalachee, but it was the first two months of -- of the school year. We hadn't had an -- had an intruder drill yet. So, we didn't even -- we weren't even completely sure where to go in the classroom. We all just -- I remember being like huddled and (inaudible). MS. WINFREY: So, I was watching your mother, even just when that tape was coming on. It's still very much PTSD, very much traumatic. You're still reliving it. And how has it been for you? How did you -- how were you notified that there was a shooting at the school? PARTICIPANT: I was notified by a friend. She called me. I was at work, and she called me, and she said, ""Do you know about the shooting?"" Which -- with the school that she goes to, the Apalachee. I said, ""No, I don't."" And then she said, ""There was a shooter at the Apalachee High School."" My dr- -- my heart just dropped. In my heart, it just got so heavy, and I could not stop -- I just like -- I had to leave. I told my coworkers, ""I got to go. I have to leave."" And my first thing I did is drop my knee on the floor and just start praying. I prayed for about 30 minutes from my -- from my work on the way to the s- -- I didn't get to get to the school on my car. I had to leave my car at a gas station about two -- maybe two and a half, three miles, and I walk on foot. And I ran because my heart was so heavy, I could not get -- I couldn't get in touch with my daughter. MS. WINFREY: And I hear you have a message for people in power regarding guns now. PARTICIPANT: I do. I want to finish that story, because no parent should go through this. I want to just finish what -- MS. WINFREY: Yes, go ahead. PARTICIPANT: -- you know, the whole -- the experience -- you do not know what feels until it's you. MS. WINFREY: Yes. PARTICIPANT: You know, all those numbers that you show on the TV -- MS. WINFREY: Yes. PARTICIPANT: -- you know, a lot of people that are here are mothers. You know, what are we doing about this? What are we doing? Let's make sure that everybody listens. Let's make sure that everybody hears it. The whole world needs to hear that we women that have our children, we have a job. That job is to protect our children. That job is to protect our nation. That job is to protect our country. (Applause.) We cannot let -- we cannot leave -- we cannot let that go on. We have to stop it. You know, where -- I was asking earlier, where are those people (inaudible) the shooting? Where are they? They needed to make a noise. I'm ready to make a noise about this, and I'm ready to stop it. Because no one -- no one knows what feels when you can't find your child. When you call her and you call her and she's not answering. When I went through it, you know, it's just me that knows it. And I'm sure -- I'm so sorry for those that lost -- their -- their children actually died. I can actually hug my child. My child is here. And I gave all these praise to my -- the Lord, our Father in Heaven saved my child. You know, but the other two mothers there lost their kids, and there are the teachers that died. You know, those people are suffering like I'm suffering. I'm very sorry for them. I'm very sorry that they lost the pe- -- their loved ones. MS. WINFREY: And you have a message for the people in power. PARTICIPANT: Yes, the people in power: Let's make it a change. Let's make happen. Let's make -- you know, let's just not hear about this. Who wants to just hear about this? (Applause.) We got to change it. We got to make it happen. You know? MS. WINFREY: And, Doug -- Doug, I hear you're not a registered Democrat, but you now say it doesn't matter what side of the aisle you're on when it comes to this issue. What change do you want to see now that it has affected your family? PARTICIPANT: You know, common sense. You know, I think a first step would just be metal detectors in schools -- you know, make a budget, make a plan. And -- and the people that say, ""Well, we've never really done stuff like that before."" I don't care. You know, they didn't have metal detectors at airports at one time. You know, they didn't have metal detectors at courthouses. They -- you know, I think that if a child knew that he would -- would get caught that the likelihood of him trying would be -- they may -- there may be another target, but it wouldn't be us having to worry about schools being hardened. Or, you know -- MS. WINFREY: Yeah. Yeah. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. I mean, I think that Doug has said it so eloquently, which is, we just need to apply common sense. And, look, I think for far too long on the issue of gun violence, some people have been pushing a really false choice to suggest you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away. I'm in favor of the Second Amendment, and I'm in favor of assault weapons bans -- (applause) -- universal background checks, red flag laws. And these are just common sense. These are just common sense. MS. WINFREY: I thought it was so powerful at the convention when you s- -- when -- when you said you have guns -- no, at the debate. At the debate when you s- -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: I'm a gun owner. Tim Walz is a gun owner. MS. WINFREY: I did not know that. (Laughter.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: And if somebody breaks into my house -- MS. WINFREY: And I thought that was powerful. THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- they're getting shot. (Laughs.) I'm sorry. MS. WINFREY: Yes. Yes. I -- I hear that. I hear that. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Probably should not have said that. (Laughter.) MS. WINFREY: But I -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: My staff will deal with that later. MS. WINFREY: Yeah. (Laughter.) But you have been a gun ow- -- gun owner for a while. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, I have. MS. WINFREY: Yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: But -- but here's -- here's my point, Oprah, is that I'm not trying to take everyone's guns away. I believe in the Second Amendment. But we have to agree that -- look, I -- I did, last fall, a -- a college tour with college-age young people. So, I also did trade schools. And packed audience every time in their auditorium, and I would ask, ""Please raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade, you had to endure an active shooter drill."" Almost every hand went up. It was bone-chilling. MS. WINFREY: Yeah. This is the way our kids -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's bone-chilling. MS. WINFREY: -- are living. Yeah. THE VICE PRESIDENT: And think about it. You know, I grew up -- we had fire drills only -- well, I grew up in California, we also had earthquake drills. But the fact that our children are sitting in a classroom where they should be fulfilling their God-given potential and exploring the wonders of the world, and some part of their brain realizes somebody could bust through that classroom drawer -- door with a -- with a weapon -- with an assault weapon. And -- and let's all agree that the -- the trauma so many children, even those who have not directly experienced the tragedy -- MS. WINFREY: Just being in the environment. THE VICE PRESIDENT: I -- MS. WINFREY: Just being in the environment. THE VICE PRESIDENT: I cannot tell you the number of young people who -- I mean, our kids had active shooter drills -- that -- that they're concerned that there might be somebody who would kill them while they are at school. This is not the sign of a civil society. MS. WINFREY: It is not. THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we -- it doesn't have to be this way. MS. WINFREY: It doesn't have to -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: It does not have to be this way. MS. WINFREY: -- be this way. THE VICE PRESIDENT: But we need to have the courage to act. I mean, look, my opponent, when he was told and -- and knew about a -- a shooting of a young girl, you know what he said? ""Get over it."" ""Get over it."" No, we're not getting over it. No. And -- and to the point, everyone should have a sense of collective responsibility for the children of our community -- MS. WINFREY: Yes. THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and understand their right to live and be safe. I have personally prosecuted homicide cases. I know -- I've -- autopsies. I've seen autopsies. I've seen what these weapons do to the human body. And we've got to agree that, in particular, when we're talking about something like an assault weapon, it's literally designed to be a tool of war. It has no place on the streets of a civil society. (Applause.) It's designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly. And there are things we can do. I mean, thankfully, over the last three years -- MS. WINFREY: Gosh, it just seems like -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we've done some. MS. WINFREY: -- common sense. It seems like -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: But it is common sense. MS. WINFREY: It just seems like common sense. We would see this. We would see this. THE VICE PRESIDENT: I think so. MS. WINFREY: And I think that the majority of Americans agree with you -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. MS. WINFREY: -- that we do not want assault weapons in the hands of children and other people who have no business with those types of weapons. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. Right. MS. WINFREY: We know this is true. So, we thank you, Natalie, and your family, for being here. PARTICIPANT: Thank you for -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. MS. WINFREY: And good luck in that marching band this year. I hear you're going to go out for the marching band still. PARTICIPANT: Thank you for inviting us. MS. WINFREY: Thank you. PARTICIPANT: It's -- it's -- we are -- unfortunately, it's a sad moment for us, but I wanted to make sure that, you know, we came because we needed to be heard and we needed to -- you know, change has to be made. It -- and we ready to fight for this. MS. WINFREY: Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Okay. We want to hear what's going on in another battleground state. Tracey is a regional organizing director in Nevada. Tracey, tell us how things are going for you. Hi. PARTICIPANT: (Via teleconference.) Hi, everybody. I'm Tracey Ly, a regional organizing director in Nevada. I'm in the Silver State this year because there's so much on the line. From health care to lowering costs, these inch- -- these issues impact all of us. My team and I have been building relationships with voters across this state, because, here in Nevada, we know that enthusiasm alone does not win campaigns; organizing does. So, all of you watching tonight can become organizers. Whether you talk to your sister, a roommate, or a grandparent about why you're so excited to vote for Vice President Harris, you are organizing and energizing other supporters. So, please go to Go.KamalaHarris.com to find ways to help. And enjoy the rest of tonight's event, and let's get to work. MS. WINFREY: Let's get to work. Let's do something. (Applause.) Meryl Streep, hello. You and I -- hi, Meryl Streep. (Applause.) MS. STREEP: (Via teleconference.) Hi. (Laughs.) MS. WINFREY: You and I have talked about this moment. MS. STREEP: Hi, hi, hi. MS. WINFREY: How are you feeling? How are you feeling about the momentum? MS. STREEP: Oh, man. This -- this has been overwhelming to have the privilege to sit in and -- and listen to the testimony of the people here. Hello, President Harris -- oh. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Not yet. MS. STREEP: (Inaudible.) (Laughter and applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Forty-seven days. MS. WINFREY: Forty-seven days, yes. MS. STREEP: (Laughs.) From my mouth to God's ear. (Laughter.) And hello, Oprah. I think the word of the day has been ""preventable."" Preventable. All of this, the surround of hatred and -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. MS. STREEP: -- and venom and toxicity and encouraging some segment of Americans to hate other segment of Americans -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. MS. STREEP: -- it's just crazy, and nobody wants it. We're done. THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. MS. STREEP: We're done with it. I'm just -- I wanted to ask you -- (laughs) -- I can't believe I have this opportunity. (Laughter.) I probably never will again. (Laughter.) If -- I have a little Debbie Downer moment, because, actually, I think you're going to win. I'm sure you're going to win. I think -- (applause) -- yeah. But what happens when you win -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. MS. STREEP: -- and he doesn't accept it? And you know that there's going to be this long slog of shenanigans. And I'm wondering wh- -- how we get to that moment, how we preserve certification on January 6th? Because if it doesn't happen, it'll be maybe thrown back to the legislatures of the states. And I've been -- I've been working with State Government Citizens' Campaign, which is SGC[C]America.com, so -- they're -- they're a great -- they're doing the -- the unglamorous, down-ballot work of promoting those -- those candidates. Because we really -- I'm worried about it. And I wonder -- I wonder if we're ready for January 7th, 8th, 9th, and what happens. What happens? THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, we will be ready. But just taking a step back and -- and thank you, Meryl, for your -- just the gift that you give: you -- you are a -- you -- your talent and your creativity. Thank you for being here. One of the things that I have realized in the course of our campaign is that more Americans than we may realize who voted for Trump before have decided January 6th was just a bridge too far. It -- when we reflect and think about what January 6th was, where the president of the United States, sitting in the Oval Office, incited a mob, a violent mob, to attack the United States Capitol, such that 140 law enforcement officers were injured -- some were killed -- to -- to try and upend a free and fair election where the American people voted -- that was a bridge too far for a lot of people. And we have sadly now seen how far he could go. And I think there is absolutely no tolerance whatsoever for the vast majority of Americans for that. And they've seen the lies. They understand, for example, almost every court case -- I think every court case where he's challenged an election he lost. I said on the debate stage, look, because he's having a very difficult time, obviously, processing the fact that 81 million people fired him. (Applause.) Right? But -- so, there is that: that it really was a bridge too far for so many people that they are not willing to repeat. But the other piece of it is the lawyers are working. The -- it's very important that we all speak to our friends and our neighbors about misinformation and help them now see how it occurs, where it is occurring. It is important that we stand up for the integrity of poll workers and people who are working on Election Day. And -- and that we also -- and this is critically important, that we ask people to be alert about mis- and disinformation, and we ask them, ""Do not be afraid to vote."" Because I think there is also something quite insidious about these attacks on the electorate in these various forms that are intended to convince people that their vote won't matter. And, in that way, there's a little bit of reverse psychology going on here, and let's -- let's just make sure nobody falls for it. Your vote does matter, and we cannot let anyone ever take our power from us. We can never let anybody silence us. (Applause.) And when we get those votes out, starting soon -- early voting is already going to start this week, I think -- through November 5th. And let's make sure everyone votes. And we are going to have a good Election Day. We're going to fight for the integrity of the people's voice and for our democracy. And, you know, I'll just mention. Earlier, a couple of folks talked about what this means in terms of the world. You know, Oprah, as -- as vice president, I have -- I've met over 150 world leaders: presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. And the thing about representing the United States of the America is when we walk in those rooms around the world, we have historically and traditionally been able to walk in those rooms chin up, shoulders back, with the self-appointed and earned authority to talk about the importance of democracies. People around the world are watching right now. Because, you see, the thing about walking into a room and being a role model is people watch what you do to see if it lines up with what you say. And, in that way, the consequences of this election are directly going to impact the American people and people around the world. That's what we're fighting for and those are the stakes. And that's why we're going to win, because we know what we're fighting for. We -- because we know what we stand for. (Applause.) MS. WINFREY: Thank you, Meryl. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. MS. WINFREY: So -- thank you, Meryl. What is on your heart to say to the American people, as we have 47 days until November 5th? What's on your heart -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: We -- MS. WINFREY: -- to say to particularly those people who are still undecided or maybe indifferent or on the fence still? THE VICE PRESIDENT: We love our country. I love our country. I know we all do. That's why everybody is here right now. We love our country. We -- we take pride in the privilege of being American. And this is a moment where we can and must come together as Americans, understanding we have so much more in common than what separates us. Let's come together with the -- the character that we are so proud of about who we are, which is we are an optimistic people. We are an optimistic people. Americans, by character, are people who have dreams and ambitions and aspirations. We believe in what is possible. We believe in what can be. And we believe in fighting for that. That's how -- that's how we came into being, because the people before us understood that one of the greatest expressions for the love of our country, one of the greatest expressions of patriotism, is to fight for the ideals of who we are, which includes freedom to make decisions about your own body; freedom to be safe from gun violence; freedom to have access to the ballot box; freedom to be who you are and just be, to love who you love openly and with pride; freedom to just be. And that's who we are. We believe in all that. And so, this is a moment where we stand, knowing what we are fighting for. We're not fighting against. It's what we're fighting for. MS. WINFREY: Thank you. Thank you. Madam Vice President. (Applause.) Thank you. And I want to say -- (applause) -- thank you, Madam Vice President. I also want to say: Thank you, Jotaka. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Jotaka. MS. WINFREY: Thank you, Jotaka Eaddy and the Win With Black Women, who started the gatherings on Zoom and all of the grassroots. Now each of you listening tonight, you become your own grassroots organization to go forward and do something, coming together for the largest Zoom call we've all ever had. Thank you so much. (Applause.) And I just want to say -- I just want to say, for all of you watching who are still on the fence -- you're in the middle; you're independent, as I am -- or whether you're -- just still don't know what you're going to do: This is the moment for all decent people, all caring people who want the best for yourself and you want the best for other people. This is the moment for people who are tired of all of the bickering and all of the name-calling; people who are exhausted by the craziness -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. MS. WINFREY: -- and the made-up stories and the conspiracies. This is the moment. You want to get on with your life, because you know that we can do better and that we deserve better. You know this. I know you know this. I know you feel this. I know this is what you're saying amongst yourselves. It's in all the conversations that we're having, that you're having. And we're better than this. We're better. THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're better than this. MS. WINFREY: We're better. And we want to create a world where our children will be safe in school again. And as my friend and mentor Maya Angelou always said, ""When you know better, you got to -- AUDIENCE: Do better. MS. WINFREY: -- do better."" Thank you. So, let's do better and vote for Kamala Harris. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Oprah. MS. WINFREY: Thank you to all of our special guests. Thank you for sharing your stories, for being here -- Ms. Shanette. (Applause.) Vice President Harris, we thank you. We hope you keep fighting for us -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: I will. MS. WINFREY: -- and the country we deserve to have. Thank you so much. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Oprah. MS. WINFREY: To find out more about how you can register or where you can vote, go to IWillVote.com. Good night, everybody. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good night. MS. WINFREY: Thank you on Zoom. (Applause.) Thank you.","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374232",6467,"THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you, Gabby. (Applause.) Thank you all so very much. I — first of all, Mayor, thank you for being here, and I (inaudible) — (applause). You've been — you've just been extraordinary as a leader and also as a friend, and I thank you so very much. Hi, guys. (Applause.) I'm so happy to see you guys. What schools are represented here? AUDIENCE: (Inaudible.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: UPenn! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. (Laughter.) Poor guy. You're the only one in here from UPenn. (Laughter.) (Applause.) Okay. Come on. (Laughter.) (Applause.) I'm so happy to see you guys. You know, I — you guys know how I feel about you and your generation. You all are just killing it. And you are the reason — one of the reasons, for sure, that I am so optimistic and excited about the future of our country. Your generation — seriously, because you guys — the thing I love about you: You're brilliant, you care, you are impatient. (Laughter.) You're like, ""I'm not waiting for somebody else to handle this; I'm going to work on getting it done,"" which is why you guys are all here. You all have figured out — you know, I think we're all born as leaders, and it's a matter of when you decide to kick it in, and you all have decided to do that at this stage of your life in such a critical way. And every issue that is at play in this election is going to directly impact you. And, of course, you know that, and that's why you're here, because you're taking matters into your own hands. And I think it's really important at a moment like this, when there are some powerful forces, frankly, that are trying to diminish and belittle and suggest that, you know, we have nothing in common and divide us that leaders pull together, build community, build coalitions — right? — who really intentionally understand the power in the collective. And you all have figured that out in such an amazing way. And I hope you're making friends with each other, because you're going to run into each other years from now like, ""Yeah, you remember '24 (inaudible)"" — (laughter). You guys are going to remember each other when — whether you decide to run for elected office or whatever you decide to do with your role of leadership. So, I hope you're making friends and enjoying each other as you build up what we need to do over the next 49 days. In 49 days, we are going to make such a big difference, and we're going to win. We are winning this campaign. (Applause.) We are winning this campaign. And I will tell you — and I will tell you, it's very, very important to me, and I know to you that our goal, yes, is that we must and will win and that through these next 49 days, we continue to build community and coalition. Let's leave something for the work we are doing right now that lifts people up, that strengthens people, that strengthens communities. Right? Let's have that as our co-equal goal, because that's when we really — combined with the goal, the ultimate goal of winning, that's when we're about building something that will be bigger than any one of us, and it's a great feeling. You all have heard me say probably many times, I think part of what's wrong and backward thinking about what we've been seeing from some folks is the suggestion that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down, instead of what we all know: The true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. So, let's do our work. (Applause.) Let's do our work in a way that is about doing just that, and that includes being a volunteer. You know, I've worked on many campaigns, and I don't know if some of you know, but I — my first political office that I ran for was freshman class representative of the liberal arts student council. (Laughter and applause.) Mayor, it was a very tough race. I ran against this girl from Jersey. She was tough. (Laughter.) But I was from Oakland, so we were all right. (Laughter and applause.) But I say all that to say that there is so much that you guys are going to do during these next days. It's about knocking on doors and talking with people. You know, I know everyone is living online and through their phones, but the power that I hope you have seen already and you're going to see over these next 49 days — there's an incredible power that comes with just looking somebody in the eye, shaking their hand, asking them, ""How are you doing? What are you concerned about? What are you worried about? What are your dreams? What are your hopes?"" It's an incredible, incredible thing you can do when you do that sincerely. And you're going to see that there's a lot of joy that comes with that experience, too, but an incredible amount of power. And so, that's the — that's the joy of — of volunteering. You know, and you going to knock on doors, you're going to call. It is just as equally important. You know, I mean — you know, so many people in my life, they're like, ""You're the only person who leaves voicemails that I know."" (Laughter.) But they love my voicemails — (laughter) — because there's something about hearing another human's voice in addition to receiving a text message. Right? And so, you're going to be doing the calls, and you're going to be texting, and you're going to be engaging. And it's a reciprocal relationship, and you're going to be receiving so much in the process. So, thank you all for all that you are doing and that you're committing to do over these next 49 days. I know there are many other things you could be doing. Don't put aside your studies. (Laughter.) You know, shower from time to time. (Laughter.) Try to eat vegetables when you can. (Laughter.) But enjoy it and know — know, most importantly, you are making a difference. You are making a difference. Our country is relying on you guys. We really are. So, keep at it. Thank you for everything. Today is National Voter Registration Day. We — voting registration, I believe, ends October 21st, so we've got, you know, about a month to get this done and make sure that people are registered. And then we're going to remind them about why it's important that they are, because their voice is their power; their power is their voice. We're going to remind people: Don't ever let anybody silence your power. (Applause.) Right? (Inaudible.) So, with that, I'll see you all in these streets. And please take care. (Applause.) And be well. And thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. (Applause.)","","",""

Can we please hear it for Mary-Grace? (Applause.) It's good to be back in Pennsylvania. Hi, everyone. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Okay. We got some business to handle. Okay. (Applause.) (Laughs.) So, let me start by saying to everyone here, thank you for all you are doing and for taking the time to be here this evening. You know, one of the things that I love about everyone who is here and what we are doing: You know, in the midst of this moment where there are people trying to divide us as a nation, trying to make people feel small and feel alone, these are moments that remind all of us that we are all in this together as one loving community. (Applause.) We're all in this together. We're all in this together. So, thank you all for the time you've taken to be here this evening. I want to thank also all the incredible leaders, including Governor Shapiro, who you heard from earlier — (applause); Senator Bob Casey, who we will reelect to the United States Senate — (applause); and Mayor Brown. And thank you, Mayor, for the warm welcome. (Applause.) All right. So, Pennsylvania, three days ago, Donald Trump and I had our debate. (Applause.) (Laughs.) You watched it? (Laughs.) So — yeah. So, here's the thing. So, I — I take it many people here watched it. So — (applause). (Laughs.) So, you'll remember, that night I talked about issues that matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom — (applause) — and keeping our nation safe and secure. (Applause.) But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump. AUDIENCE: Noo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: Instead, it was the same old show, the same tired playbook we've heard for years with no plan — no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. Well, folks, it's time to turn the page. (Applause.) Let's turn the page. We're not going back. We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And — AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are not going back because — AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back because America is ready for a new way forward. (Applause.) We are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do together, which is why — and, Mary-Grace, thank you — which is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign. (Applause.) We need a president of the United States who works for all the American people — (applause) — and that just stops with all the trying to divide us. Like, people are exhausted with that stuff. (Applause.) Exhausted. And, you know, my entire career, I have fought for the people. As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. (Applause.) As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. (Applause.) I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges — (applause); for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due — (applause); for seniors facing elder abuse. And as attorney general of a border state, I took on transnational criminal organizations, like the Sinaloa Cartel, that traffic in drugs and threaten the safety of our communities. (Applause.) I know these cartels firsthand, and as president, I will make sure we prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law — (applause) — for pushing poison like fentanyl on our children. (Applause.) And as president, I will fight on behalf of all communities and all Americans. And together, we will build a brighter future for our nation. (Applause.) Together. Together. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And that future — and that future we build will include what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, and to start a business. You know, I love our small businesses. So, growing up — (applause) — I really — do we have small-business leaders here? Raise your hand. (Applause.) Yeah. Right? Right? So, growing up, my sister and my mother — my sister and me had a mother — have a mother — had a mother — excuse me; she passed. But our mother worked long hours. She worked hard; she worked long hours. And my sister, Maya, and I would go over to Ms. Shelton's house. Ms. Shelton lived a couple of doors down, and she helped my mother take care of us. And we, in fact, used to call her our second mother. Well, Ms. Shelton was a small-business owner. And I will tell you, since I was a child, I know the character and the — the person who is a small-business owner. You're not only business leaders; you're civic leaders. You hold the community together. You're part of the fabric of the community. And small-business owners are the backbone of America's economy. (Applause.) The backbone of America's economy. Which is why part of my plan that you heard about the other night will give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses — (applause) — knowing that not everybody, like my opponent, got handed $40 million on a silver tray and then filed for bankruptcy six times — (applause) — and people sometimes just need the opportunity, because we, as Americans, do not lack for ambition, for aspiration, for dreams, for the preparedness to do hard work, but not everyone has the opportunity, because not everyone has the access. When I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is grounded in that foundational belief that when given an opportunity, people excel every day — (applause) — every day. Part of my focus is on the fact that we need to build more housing in America. (Applause.) And so, we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term. (Applause.) And I have a plan to help lower the cost of living for America's families on everything from health care to groceries, including I will take on corporate price gouging — (applause) — which, as we know, is about those few bad guys taking advantage of desperate people. And there needs to be a consequence. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut, including — including expanding the Child Tax Credit — (applause) — to $6,000 during the first year of a child's life, understanding that new parents need support in that most critical phase of their child's development to help them — (applause) — buy a car seat, a crib, baby clothes. I will also make sure good-paying jobs are available to all Americans, not just those with college degrees. (Applause.) For far too long, our nation has encouraged only one path to success: a four-year college degree. Our nation needs to recognize the value of other paths — additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs. (Applause.) So, as president, I will get rid of the unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs — (applause) — to increase jobs for folks without a four-year degree, understanding that requiring a certain degree does not necessarily talk about one's skills. (Applause.) And I will challenge the private sector to do the same. (Applause.) All of this to say, look, I come from the middle class. I understand where I come from, and I'm never going to forget that. And I will always put middle-class working people first. It will always be my priority — (applause) — always be my priority. I know where I come from. I know where I come from. But now, Donald Trump has a different plan. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just google — just — just look up the Google. (Laughter.) Just google Project 2025. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is a detailed, dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he were elected president again. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts, like he did before. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he wants to impose what I call the ""Trump sales tax"" on everyday basic necessities, which, as economists have reviewed, would cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: In fact, independent economists like Goldman Sachs have said my plan would grow our economy — (applause) — and his plan would shrink the economy, reignite inflation, and send us into a recession by the middle of next year. On top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And let's remember — AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: Like, we're not here with Trump amnesia. We remember. Remember, when he was president, he tried 60 times to end the Affordable Care Act. And as he said in the debate just this week, he has no — no plan to replace it. (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. Right. You said it. He said he has, quote, ""concepts of a plan"" — ""concepts of a plan,"" no actual plan. So, let's — let's just think about this for a moment. He's going threaten health insurance for the 45 million people who rely on it based on a concept and take us back — AUDIENCE: Noo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: — when insurance companies had — but — because we remember where that was. We remember what that was when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. Remember what that was like? Remember. Well, we are — AUDIENCE: Not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: — not going back. We are not going back. (Applause.) No. We are not going back. (Applause.) Because — because — because ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) And — and ours is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.) And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intent that they would overturn Roe v. Wade, and they did exactly as he intended. (Protestor interruption.) AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we — and we understand where we are. We understand where we are. AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hey, listen. Listen. Now — now is the time to get a hostage deal and ceasefire. I — we have been working around the clock to get that done. (Applause.) And I respect your voice, but right now I am speaking. (Applause.) So, on the issue — so, on the issue of fundamental rights and freedoms, we remember how he selected those members of the Supreme Court to undo Roe v. Wade. They did just as he intended. And what we have seen is, in state after state, they passed laws to criminalize health care providers, to punish women. Now, more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions — AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: — many with no exceptions for rape and incest, which is immoral. To tell a survivor of a violation to their body that they don't have a right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, that's immoral. And let us agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do — (applause) — not the government. And I will tell you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly. And I'm traveling our country, and I'll tell you, across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won fundamental freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote — (applause); the freedom to be safe from gun violence — (applause); the freedom to join a union — (applause); and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.) And generations — let's remember who we are as Americans. Generations before us led the fight for freedom. And to the friends here, I say: The baton is now in our hands. (Applause.) It is now in our hands. And so much is on the line in this election. We all know and remember. This is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher than they were then, because two months ago, the United States Supreme Court essentially told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does, if he gets back into the White House. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Imagine what that might mean. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. He who has vowed, if reelected, he would be a dictator on day one. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: He who calls for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States. And let us be clear: Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States of America should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, Pennsylvania, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. (Applause.) We love — we love our country. And we who are here understand the awesome responsibility — the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth: the privilege and pride of being an American. (Applause.) That's right. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. (Applause.) So, Pennsylvania, 53 days until Election Day. (Applause.) And we know ours will be a tight race until the very end. We are the underdog. We are the underdog. Let's remember that and know that. And we know how they play. We know how they play. We are the underdog, and we have some very hard work ahead of us. But here's the thing. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.) And with your help, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. So, Pennsylvania, today, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.) And when we fight — AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win. (Applause.) God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)","","",""

We owe it to the voters. Because here's the thing, in this election, what's at stake could not be more important.

And let me tell you, I love our small businesses. Are there small business leaders here? Raise your hand. (Applause.) That's right. That's right. So, you know, growing up -- growing up, my mother, she worked long hours. She often worked very long hours, my mother. And so, my sister Maya and I would go over to Ms. Shelton's house. Now, Ms. Shelton, we called her our second mother. She was the second mother to us. She actually was from Louisiana, and she would take care of us in the evenings and on the weekends when my mother was working. And she was a small-business owner. And let me tell you what I learned from being a young child about a small-business owner, Ms. Shelton. Our small-business owners, you are business leaders and you are civic leaders. You are community leaders. (Applause.) You hire locally. You mentor. You are part of the fabric of our communities. And you, like Ms. Shelton, are the backbone of America's economy -- (applause) -- the backbone. So, I have a plan for you, and my plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction for start-up businesses. (Applause.) Because I understand not everybody, like the person that was on the stage with me the other night, gets handed $400 million on a silver platter and then files for bankruptcy six times. (Applause.) Come on. Come on. I know what -- because, look, my mother, she worked hard, she saved up, and it wasn't until I was a teenager she was able to buy our first home. I know the challenges that Americans and working people and families are having right now in terms of affordable housing. And we need to build more housing in America. (Applause.) So, part of my plan -- part of my vision for an opportunity economy is we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term. (Applause.) And I have a plan to lower the cost of living for America's families on everything from health care to groceries, including taking on price gouging -- (applause) -- and those corporations when they take advantage of people in need. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut. (Applause.) Thousands of dollars of your hard-earned money will go back in your pockets, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life -- (applause) -- for young parents, knowing in that critical stage of your child's development, you might need a little help, not just to get by but to get ahead. (Applause.) And I will always put the middle class and working families first. I know where I came from. (Applause.) I know where I came from. I'm clear about that. Now, Donald Trump -- well, he has a different plan. Just google ""Project 2025."" AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: I see you have. (Laughs.) It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires massive cuts -- massive tax cuts and cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- even as they pull down record profits. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he wants to impose what I call a ""Trump sales tax"" on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average American family nearly $4,000 a year. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Some of the top economists in our country and in the world have reviewed these plans. Goldman Sachs, for example, has said that my plan would grow our economy and his plan would shrink the economy -- (applause) -- that his plan would reignite inflation and send us into a recession by the middle of next year. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: On top of this -- on top of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now, think about that. Think about that. Think -- we remember what it meant when insurance companies could deny you for a preexisting condition. Remember what that was? So, he wants to get rid of it. And as he said in the debate, he made clear he has no plan to replace it. In fact -- you remember? ""Concept."" (Laughter.) Do you remember? He has, quote, ""concepts of a plan."" Concepts of a plan. I mean, we're 54 days from this election. ""Concepts of a plan,"" which means no actual plan -- (laughter) -- which means no actual plan. And 45 million Americans are insured through the Affordable Care Act. So, understand what that means. He's going to end it based on a concept and take us back when folks were suffering. Well, we're not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. (Applause.) We're not going back. No, we're not going back. No, we -- we, together, will move forward, because ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) And -- and ours is a fight for freedom -- (applause) -- like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.) And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade -- with the intention they would undo the protections. And they did exactly as he intended. And now, more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban, including North Carolina -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and every single state in the South except Virginia, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. It is immoral -- immoral. And I know everyone here understands. Let us agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.) Come on. Come on. And when -- and when he was asked on Tuesday night, Donald Trump refused to say that he would veto a national abortion ban. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well -- well, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law -- (applause) -- proudly sign it into law. We are not playing around. And across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on attack on hard- fought, hard-won fundamental rights and freedoms, like the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence -- (applause); the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water -- (applause); and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.) And here's the thing that I know about all of the North Carolinian leaders who are here. You know this so well as part of your DNA. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Generations of Americans before us, many from right here -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: Get a medic! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- led the fight for freedom. (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: Medic! Medic! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let's get a medic. Let's get a medic. Do we have a medic? Get -- no -- let's get a medic over there, please. Let's get a medic a- -- over there. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. But let's make sure -- see -- see, this is who we are. We look out for each other. That's what leaders do: looking out for each other. (Applause.) Okay, we've got a medic. Okay. So, generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom, and now the baton is in our hands. (Applause.) The baton is now in our hands. And we who believe, then, in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and red flag laws. (Applause.) So much is on the line in this election -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: You got this, Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And -- we got this. (Applause.) We got this. But look -- but look, here's the thing. This is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher, because two months ago, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well -- well, here's the thing, the courts will take care of that. Let's take care of November. How about that? (Applause.) All right? (Laughs.) But imagine -- imagine what that court ruling means. Imagine what that means. Because before, there might have been at least the -- the belief that there would be the threat of consequence, but now there's an explicit ruling from the court that suggests he would be immune. Imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Imagine what that would look like. He who has vowed, if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He who called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States. And let us be very clear: Someone who suggests that we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. Never. (Applause.) And put that all in the context of people who have been talking about how he was when they served with him in the White House, people who saw him every day -- his national security advisor, his defense secretary, his chief of staff, and his vice president -- all -- all of whom have warned America Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States -- (applause) -- and should never occupy our nation's highest office again. So, North Carolina, I believe it all comes down to this. We are here together. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) And we together understand the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth: the privilege and pride of being an American. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's an awesome responsibility. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right. That's right. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I do believe -- I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. (Applause.) And so, North Carolina, we have 54 days until Election Day -- (applause) -- 54 days until Election Day and just 35 days until early voting begins. (Applause.) And it's not only the presidency that's on the ballot. There are many, many important races, like Josh Stein running for governor -- (applause) -- whose -- whose opponent -- whose opponent was handpicked by Donald Trump because he wants a total ban on abortion in this state. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And that is just one of the many stakes that are at play in this election. But see, we know the power is with the people. The power is with the people. (Applause.) Your voice is your vote, North Carolina. (Applause.) And you are going to make all the difference in the outcome of this race. And look, we know ours will be a very tight race until the very end. We are the underdog. Let's be clear about that. We are the underdog. And so, we have hard work ahead of us, but we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. And with your help, we will win. We will win. (Applause.) And so, I ask you today, North Carolina, are you ready to make your voices heard? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in freedom? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in opportunity? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in the promise of America? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: And are we ready to fight for it? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: And when we fight -- AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win. (Applause.) (Laughs.) There you go. God bless you. And God bless America. (Applause.)","","",""

Can we give it up for Stacy for telling her incredible story? (Applause.) And can we please thank that incredible Anthony Hamilton for his incredible performance? (Applause.) I love Anthony Hamilton. And it is so good -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back. I love you back. Thank you. And we have so many outstanding leaders here today, including my friend, Governor Roy Cooper, and your next -- (applause) -- and your next governor, Attorney General Josh Stein. (Applause.) And here with us is your next attorney general, Congressman Jeff Jackson. (Applause.) Mayor Lyles, my dear friend; the Council of State candidates; and all the leaders who are with us today, I thank you all -- everyone -- everyone here for taking the time and doing the work you are doing.(Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) All right. So, here's the thing. Okay. We got a lot of work to do. We got a lot of work to do. Okay. So, North Carolina, you probably know -- and please have a seat, if you have a chair. (Laughs.) Two nights ago, Donald Trump and I had our first debate. (Applause.) And I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate -- (applause) -- because this election and what is at stake could not be more important. On Tuesday night, I talked about issues that I know matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom -- (applause) -- and keeping -- and keeping our nation safe and secure. But that's not what we heard from Donald Trump. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Instead, it was the same old show, that same tired playbook that we've heard for years, with no plans for how he would address the needs of the American people -- because you know it's all about him, it's not about you. Well, folks, I said it then; I say it now: It's time to turn the page. (Applause.) Turn that page. Turn that page. B- -- AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Turn the p- -- (laughs). AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because, to your point -- to your point, America is ready for a new way forward. (Applause.) We are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do together. That is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign. (Applause.) Over 200 people who worked for President George H.W. Bush, President George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney have endorsed me for president. (Applause.) Former Vice President Dick Cheney and Congresswoman Liz Cheney are supporting me as well. (Applause.) Because, as they said, we have a duty as citizens to put country above partisanship and defend our Constitution. (Applause.) And that is my pledge to you. I will always put country above party, and I will be a president for all Americans. (Applause.) And while Donald Trump is trying to pull our nation backward, we are fighting for the future -- (applause) -- a future with affordable childcare, paid leave, and affordable health care; a future where we build what I call an opportunity economy so every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business. (Applause.) And, you know, I -- I talked about it the other night. I love our small businesses. I really do. I love our small businesses. My -- my -- and -- and they're -- many of whom are here. (Laughs.) (Applause.) And -- and the thing about our small businesses is -- is they are -- you know, my -- so, first of all, my mother worked very hard. And -- and there was a lady who helped raise us, who was a second mother to us, Ms. Shelton, and she was a small business owner. And I grew up, then, understanding who our small business owners are. They're -- they're the -- they're leaders in the community. They're civic leaders. They hire locally. They mentor. They're part of the fabric of the community. And -- and I know they are the backbone of America's economy. (Applause.) So, my plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses. (Applause.) Because, you know, not everybody started out with 40 -- $400 million on a silver platter and then filed for bankruptcy six times. But a whole lot of people have the ingenuity, the entrepreneurship, the work ethic, and the ambition to do that kind of work and just need to be seen and supported for what they are and what they do for all of us.(Applause.) An opportunity economy. We need to build more housing in America. (Applause.) And so, we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term. (Applause.) I have a plan to lower the cost of living for America's families on everything from health care to groceries. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax break, and thousands of dollars of your hard-earned money will go back into your pockets, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life. (Applause.) And I will always put middle-class and working families first. I grew up a middle-class kid. (Applause.) I was raised by a hardworking mother, who saved up, and by the time I was a teenager, she was able to afford to buy our first home. I understand how people work hard and have dreams and aspirations for their children and need to be put first, understanding, again, when the middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.) America is strong. But Donald Trump, well, he has a different plan. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just google -- just google ""Project 2025."" AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and big corporations massive tax cuts and cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- even as they pull in record profits. He will add more than $5 trillion to the national debt. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he wants to impose what is, in effect, a national sales tax. I call it a ""Trump sales tax,"" because it will be a tax on everyday basic necessities, which the economists have measured will cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And -- and the top economists, they've previewed our plans. They've reviewed them. Goldman Sachs says my plan would grow our economy and his plan would shrink it. (Applause.) Sixteen -- sixteen Nobel Prize-winning economists say he would reignite inflation, and Moody's says he would ignite a recession by the middle of next year. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know, he talks a big talk, but when folks review the numbers -- highly respected folks -- that's what you learn about him. That's what you learn. And North Carolina, on top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And as Stacy mentioned, you heard what he said in the debate. He -- he has no plan to replace it. (Laughter.) He said -- (laughs) -- he said ""concepts of a plan."" (Laughs.) Oh, you all watched the debate. (Laughs.) (Applause.) ""Concepts."" ""Concepts."" No actual plan. ""Concepts."" (Laughter.) And understand what's at stake on that: 45 million Americans are insured through the Affordable Care Act, and he's going to end it based on a concept -- (laughter) -- and take us back to when insurance companies have the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. Well, we are not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) We're not going back. We're -- AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. No. We will move forward. We will move forward, because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom -- (applause) -- like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.) And we know how we got to this issue, because Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. And now in over 20 states in our nation, they have what I call ""Trump abortion bans,"" including North Carolina -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and every single state in the South except Virginia. Think about that: every single state in the south except Virginia. Now one in three women in America lives under a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. It is immoral. It is immoral. And I know we all here understand and agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.) And what we know is that the i- -- the impact of this is -- you know, it's been over two years now since that decision came down. The impact of this is so real. It's affecting people every day just based on the stories we know, and there are so many stories we don't know. Think about it. Because of Trump's abortion bans, women are being refused care during miscarriages. Some are only being treated if they develop sepsis. And when asked on Tuesday night, Donald Trump refused to say that he would veto a national abortion ban. You remember that? He refused to answer that question. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Refused to answer that question. Well, I'mma tell you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly, proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly. And across our nation -- across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard won fundamental freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.) And North Carolina has a history of the point I'm about to make. Generations -- generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom, and now the baton is in our hands. It is in our hands. (Applause.) So, we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and red flag laws. (Applause.) So much -- so much is at stake in this election. So much is at stake in this election. And understand this is not 2016 or 2020 for a number of reasons, including why the stakes are higher. Because two months ago, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Think about that. Think about that. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right? He -- he who has vowed that if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one; that he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies; and has called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States of America. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Think about that. And let us be very clear: Somebody who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. Never again. And you know one of the points that I mentioned on Tuesday -- so, let -- the people who served under him at the White House, who saw him every day -- right? -- his national security advisor, his Defense secretary, his chief of staff, and his vice president all have warned -- all, who worked with him every day in the White House, sat with him in the Oval Office -- have warned America Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States and should never again occupy our nation's highest office. (Applause.) So, North -- AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. So -- so, it comes down to this. It comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. And we understand the awesome -- the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth: the privilege and pride of being an American. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right. Right. And so, I believe it is the highest form, then, of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. (Applause.) So, North Carolina, we have 54 days until Election Day -- (applause) -- 54 days -- and just 35 days -- just 35 days until early voting begins. (Applause.) And it's not only the presidency that's on the ballot. There are many important races, including Josh Stein running for governor -- (applause) -- that's right -- whose opponent was handpicked by Donald Trump and wants a ban -- a total ban on abortion in this state. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. So, these are the stakes in this election, up and down the ballot -- up and down the ballot. But we know the power is with the people. (Applause.) The power is with the people. And your voice is your vote, North Carolina. (Applause.) Your vote is your voice. And we know -- here's the thing, also. We're all -- we've got -- we are just -- we are loving our campaign, aren't we? We are loving this campaign. (Applause.) We're having a good time. We're having a good time. I know that. But here's also the thing. Ours will be a very tight race until the end. Okay? It's going to be a tight race until the end, and we are the underdog. Understand that. We are the underdog. There are powerful forces trying to convince people that their vote doesn't matter. AUDIENCE MEMBERS: We love you! THE VICE PRESIDENT: There are powerful forces here too. (Laughs.) But I say all that to say we've got some hard work ahead of us. But here's the thing I love about everybody here: We love hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.) And with your help, we will win in November. We will win. We will. (Applause.) We will win. So, North Carolina, today, I then ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in opportunity? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in the promise of America? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: And are we ready to fight for it? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: And when we fight -- AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win. God Bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)","","",""

Well, you know. (Applause.) We -- but we have a lot of work to do. Okay? And tonight, I think, highlighted for the American people what's at stake. I started the debate by talking about it and it became apparent, I think, throughout those -- that about an hour and a half that -- (laughter) -- look, this is very much two different vision for our country: ours, which is a vision for the future, and his, which is about the past and taking us backward. And as I said on the debate stage, we are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. And so, we know what we're fighting for. We know what we stand for.

(Applause.) Thank you, all. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. It's so good to be back in New Hampshire. Thank you all. (Applause.) Thank you. And Doug sends his love to everyone as well. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Oh, thank you, everyone. Nicole, thank you. You guys are just so extraordinary, and I applaud the way you do the business that you do and the love that you do in giving community. I love our small-business owners. It is what you do -- I'm going to talk a bit about you in a minute, but you are part of the fabric -- the essential fabric of a community that cares about one another. Thank you for everything. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. And thank you to the outstanding congressional delegation: Senators Shaheen, Hassan -- (applause); Representatives Pappas and Kuster -- (applause); and all the leaders who are here today. Thank you all. Thank you all for -- for taking the time to be here this afternoon. Thank you, everyone. (Applause.) Thank you. So, before I begin, I do want to say a few words about this tragic shooting that took place this morning in Winder, Georgia. We're still gathering information about what happened, but we know that there were multiple fatalities and injuries. And, you know, our hearts are with all the students, the teachers, and their families, of course, and we are grateful to the first responders and the law enforcement that were on the scene. But this is just a senseless tragedy on top of so many senseless tragedies. And it's just outrageous that every day in our country, in the United States of America, that parents have to send their children to school worried about whether or not their child will come home alive. It's senseless. It -- it is -- we've got to stop it. (Applause.) And we have to end this epidemic of gun violence in our country once and for all. You know, it doesn't have to be this way. It doesn't have to be this way. So, we will continue, of course, to -- to send our prayers and our thoughts to the families and all those who were affected, including, you know -- I -- I'm going off script right now, but, listen. I mean, you know, at -- at the -- last year, at -- I -- I started a college tour, and I -- I traveled our country, meeting with our young leaders, right? And so, it was college-aged young leaders. So, I did trade schools, colleges, universities, community colleges. By the way, I love Gen Z. I just love Gen Z. (Laughter.) (Applause.) Right? But I'll tell you one of the things -- one of the things that I asked every time I went to the auditorium -- and it would be filled with these young leaders, students -- and I'd ask them, ""Raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade you had to endure an active shooter drill."" And the -- for the -- for the young leaders who are here who are raising their hand, I'm telling you, every time, the auditorium was packed, and almost every hand went up. You know, a lot of us -- I'll tal- -- I'll speak about myself. You know, we had -- well, I grew up in California -- earthquake drills; we had fire drills. But our kids are sitting in a classroom where they should be fulfilling their God-given potential, and some part of their big, beautiful brain is concerned about a shooter busting through the door of the classroom. It does not have to be this way. (Applause.) It does not have to be this way. And, you know, this is one of the many issues that's at stake in this election. So, New Hampshire, look, we have 62 days to go -- (applause) -- 62 days to go. And I'm going to tell you what you already know: This race is going to be tight until the very end. So, please, let's not pay too much attention to the polls, because we are running as the underdog. We know what they're capable of on the other side. The only thing we can take for granted is the love that we as Americans have for each other, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. (Applause.) And we've got some hard work ahead, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work can be joyful work. And so, we are up for the task. And with your help, we will win in November. (Applause.) We will win in November. And that, in large part, is because we know what we stand for, and when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.) We love our country, and we believe in the promise of America. That's so much of what I think brings us all together this afternoon. We believe in the promise of America, and that includes a topic we're going to discuss today, which is what I call an ""opportunity economy"" -- building an opportunity economy. (Applause.) And my vision of an opportunity economy is one where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed; where everyone, regardless of who they are or where they start, can build wealth, including intergenerational wealth; where workers are treated with dignity, and everyone has the freedom to join a union if they choose -- (applause); where we remove barriers to opportunity, so anyone who wants to start a business can have access to the tools and the resources they need to do that. I believe -- and I said it before to Nicole -- I believe America's small businesses are an essential foundation to our entire economy. Think about it. (Applause.) Think about it. Small businesses in our country employ half of all private-sector workers. Half of all private-sector workers own or run a small business or work for a small business. They do trillions of dollars of business every year. They generate revenue that helps repair our roads and pay our teachers. And, you know -- (applause) -- for all of those who are or know of small-business owners, the thing I love about you is that you're not only leaders in business, you are civic leaders, you are community leaders, you are mentors, you hire locally, you believe in the community, and you're part of the glue of the fabric that holds communities together. You provide the local meeting space. You are the types of folks where you know who your regulars are, and when someone is walking in the door and you can tell they've had a bad day, you know exactly what they need. Isn't that the best of who we are? (Applause.) Isn't that the best of who we are? And I've met so many entrepreneurs across the country who take the incredible leap of faith that is required to start a small business -- folks who put their life's savings on the line and work through the weekends and holidays because they aren't just building a business, they're pursuing a dream. They're building a better future for their employees and for the people they love and their communities. And by extension, they're building a stronger middle class and a stronger America for us all. (Applause.) And so, all of this is why, as president, one of my highest priorities will be to strengthen America's small businesses. (Applause.) And here I am in New Hampshire to announce a few elements of my plan to do that. (Applause.) So, first, we're going to help more small businesses and innovators get off the ground. Okay? (Applause.) Now I'm setting what some, I'm sure, are going to call a very ambitious goal. But you know what? I think we should admire ambition in each other. (Laughs.) (Applause.) So, I want to see 25 million new small-business applications by the end of my first term. (Applause.) And to help achieve this, we will lower the cost of starting a new business. So, here's the thing, on average, it costs about $40,000 to start a new business in America. That is a great financial barrier for a lot of folks, and it can hold entrepreneurs back. And the current tax deduction for a start-up is just $5,000. Okay? So, then you got to make up the delta there; you got to figure out how you're going to do that. Not everyone has access to that kind of wealth and capital. So, part of my plan is we will expand the tax deduction for start-ups to $50,000. (Applause.) It's essentially a tax cut for starting a small business. Second, my plan will help existing small businesses grow. We will provide low- and no-interest loans to small businesses that want to expand, and we will -- and this is very important -- cut the red tape that can make starting and growing a small business more difficult than it needs to be -- more difficult than it needs to be. (Applause.) For example, we will make it cheaper and easier for small businesses to file their taxes, similar -- (applause) -- similar to how individuals can take a standard deduction. You know, I said to my team, kind of like -- now, I'm going to date myself again, because they no longer do it -- but kind of like -- you remember the 1040EZ? Like, that kind of idea, right? Like, let's just take away some of the bureaucracy in the process to make it easier for people to actually do something that's going to benefit our entire economy. Third -- (applause) -- third, my plan will invest in small businesses and innovators throughout America, and here's why. We know that talent exists everywhere in our country, from rural towns to city centers. But not everyone has access to the financing, to venture capital, or expert advice. It's not that they don't have the skills, it's not that they don't have the work ethic; it's access to these resources. So, under my plan, we will expand access to venture capital. We will support innovation hubs and business incubators. (Applause.) And we will increase federal contracts with small businesses. (Applause.) And we will have a particular focus on small businesses in rural communities, like right here in New Hampshire. (Applause.) Finally, my plan will make our tax code more fair, while also prioritizing investment and innovation. So, let us be clear: Billionaires and big corporations must pay their fair share in taxes. (Applause.) Because here is the thing -- here is the thing. It's just not right that those who can most afford it are often paying a lower tax rate than our teachers and our nurses and our firefighters. (Applause.) It's just not right. It's just not right. So, that's why I support a billionaire minimum tax and corporations paying their fair share. (Applause.) And while we ensure that the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share, we will tax capital gains at a rate that rewards investment in America's innovators, founders, and small businesses. (Applause.) So, here's the detail. If you earn a million dollars a year or more, the tax rate on your long-term capital gains will be 28 percent under my plan, because we know when the government encourages investment, it leads to broad-based economic growth and it creates jobs, which makes our economy stronger. (Applause.) Now compare that to what Donald Trump plans. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to cut off federal programs that give loans to small businesses. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts and to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars, even as they pull in record profits. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: His plans will add more than $5 trillion to the national debt, and that is on top of the $2 trillion tax cut he gave them when he was president and when he exploded the deficit. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: We know how to count. (Laughter.) We know how to count. And now he also wants to impose what, in effect, is a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities, which will skyrocket the cost for families and small businesses. And, New Hampshire, on top of all of this, if Donald Trump were to win in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- which would significantly increase costs on small businesses, as we know -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: Lock him up! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and -- well, you know what? The courts are going to handle that, and we will handle November. How about that? (Applause.) How about that? (Laughs.) That's how we'll handle that. How about that? (Applause.) But think about it. He wants to end the Affordable Care Act, taking us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes. So, yeah, look, we are here to tell him and them: We are not going back. (Applause.) We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: No, we are not, and we will move forward, because ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) And -- and it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.) And it is a fight for freedom. Now, I don't have to tell the folks of New Hampshire, the ""Live Free or Die"" state. (Applause.) You know the importance of individual freedoms, fundamental freedoms. You know how hard people fought for these freedoms and that they are foundational to who we are and what we stand for as America, including the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.) And understand how we got here. Understand how we got here. And, of course, we're not going to fall for the gaslighting he's pushing, right? AUDIENCE: No! THE VICE PRESIDENT: When he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And as he intended, they did. And now, in more than 20 states in our nation, there is a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral -- immoral. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And let us agree, and I know we do: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.) And if he wins -- and if he wins, you can be sure Donald Trump will go further, and he will sign a national abortion ban. And -- and you know Project 2025, which I just -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: I mean, can you believe they put that thing in writing? (Laughter.) And under Project 2025, he would create a national antiabortion coordinator, which would force states -- I mean, this is unbelievable, right? -- which would force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know what they are making really quite clear? They just don't trust women. They just don't trust women. But we trust women. (Applause.) We trust women. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Across our nation -- AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) (Inaudible.) Across our nation -- across our nation -- and I've been traveling for many, many mo- -- well, years, actually, and certainly months, most recently. Across our nation, I'm telling you, we are witnessing a full-on attack on hard-fought, hard-won fundamental freedoms and rights, including the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence -- AUDIENCE: Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water -- AUDIENCE: Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.) And so, here's what I don't have to tell the folks of New Hampshire, because you know it so well, it's part of your DNA. Generations of Americans before us, they fought for freedom and they led the fight for freedom in our country. And now the baton is in our hands. The baton is in our hands. So, let us understand, which we do, our purpose at this very moment. Let us remember the broad shoulders upon which we stand and the traditions of this very fight that have led to what we have been able to accomplish. And let us understand, then, that when we say ""fight,"" it is a fight for something, not against something. It is for something. (Applause.) That's what we're talking about when we talk about a new way forward. This is for something. And so, as an example, let us finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) Let us finally pass an assault weapons ban and universal background checks and red flag laws -- (applause) -- because we are clear, on that point, it is a false choice to say you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away. I'm in favor of the Second Amendment, and I know we need reasonable gun safety laws in our country. (Applause.) And there's another point that I'd like to stress about this election in '24. This is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher this time for a number of reasons, but I'm going to mention one, in particular: what the Supreme Court recently did when they basically just told the former president that, going forward, he will effectively be immune, no matter what he does in the White House. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: But let's take this seriously and understand what it means. Before, at least, there might have been the threat that there would be consequence and accountability. With that ruling, what this means is that almost explicitly, he has been told no consequence. And imagine -- just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Just imagine with no guardrails. He has openly vowed to be a dictator on day one. He has said he would end the independence of the Department of Justice -- the United States Department of Justice -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- so he could have the unchecked power to seek vengeance against people who disagree with him. He even called for -- I'm going to quote now -- the ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States of America. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let us be very clear: Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States of America should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. So, I'll end where I started. When it comes down to it, we are all here together because we love our country. We love our country, and we know the privilege -- the privilege and pride that comes with being an American. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That is how we realize the promise of America. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And so, with that being said, I ask: New Hampshire, are you ready to have your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.) And when we fight -- AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win! God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you. (Applause.) END 3:33 P.M. EDT","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374064",10703,"THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, everyone. Good afternoon, Detroit. (Applause.) Oh, it's good to be in the house of labor. (Applause.) Can we hear it for Tyrese? (Applause.) Tyrese, I want to thank you for your extraordinary leadership and all of your words and the heart and soul that you put into your work, like I know all the members of LIUNA and everyone here does every day, because we love our country and we know what is at stake. Thank you, Tyrese. (Applause.) Thank you. So, it is so good to be with so many incredible leaders and elected officials who are here. Governor Whitmer was here earlier -- (applause); Senator Stabenow; your next United States senator, Representative Elissa Slotkin. (Applause.) And I always want to thank Representatives Dingell -- where is she? There she -- there she is. (Applause.) Stevens, Thanedar, all of you for the work that you do every day. And to all the labor leaders who are here, I thank you all for your extraordinary work. Don't we love Labor Day? (Applause.) We love Labor Day. It's always been that way, right? The way we celebrate Labor Day is we know that hard work is good work. We know that when we organize, when we bring everyone together, it's a joyful moment where we are committed to doing the hard work of lifting up America's families. And I want to thank everyone here for that work and the way you do it every day, including General President Booker of the Laborers' -- (applause); President Fain of UAW -- (applause); President Pringle of NEA -- (applause); President Slevin of the Utility Workers -- (applause); and President Weingarten of the AFT. (Applause.) And thank you to all of the union members who are here this afternoon. So, on Labor Day and every day, we celebrate the dignity of work -- the dignity of work. We celebrate unions, because unions helped build America and unions helped build America's middle class. (Applause.) It is true across our nation, and it is true here in Detroit. Nearly 140 years ago, in this very city, 10,000 people marched in one of our nation's first Labor Day parades. Many held signs that read ""Divided, we can beg. United, we can demand."" (Applause.) For generations, in Detroit and across our nation, the brothers and sisters of labor have stood together to righteously demand fair pay, better benefits, and safe working conditions. And let me say, every person in our nation has benefited from that work. (Applause.) Everywhere I go, I tell people: Look, you may not be a union member. You better thank a union member -- (applause) -- for the five-day workweek. You better thank a union member for sick leave. You better thank a union member for paid leave. You better thank a union member for vacation time. (Applause.) Because what we know is when union wages go up, everybody's wages go up. (Applause.) When union workplaces are safer, every workplace is safer. (Applause.) When unions are strong, America is strong. (Applause.) We know what we're talking about. The labor movement has always understood the power of the collective and the power of unity -- the power of unity. And while we are fighting so much nonsense that is about trying to divide our country, trying to pull us apart, look to what the history and the present of labor tells us about the power of the collective and unity -- the spirit of that work, as much as the product of that work. It's very telling and gives us really good lessons about what creates strength. And, you know, many of you know, my parents met while they were active in the Civil Rights Movement. So, when I was young, my parents -- because I see some young leaders here today -- when I was young, my parents would take me to the meetings -- I see our young leaders -- (applause) -- and -- and take me to the marches. I was in a stroller. And from a very young age, I learned that when people stand together, when we join voices, knowing that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us -- when we join those voices, we can drive extraordinary change, which is why I believe in my heart and soul no one should ever be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. (Applause.) We are all in this together. But I'll tell you, I think that there has been a certain backward-thinking approach over the last several years, which is to suggest -- some folks, them folks -- to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we know: The true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up -- who you lift up. (Applause.) That's the measure of the strength of a leader. Let's stop with the nonsense. And in this election, we all here know there are two very different visions for our nation. Ours, focused on the future; the other, focused -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) Let's just get through the next 64 days. How about -- (laughs). (Applause.) And ours -- yes, my dear brother -- is focused on the future, and theirs is focused on the past. And we fight for the future. We fight for a future where all people receive dignity and respect and opportunity for -- not just for some but for all. That's what we are fighting for. And so, we are 64 days out from the election day. And in Michigan, mail-in absentee voting starts in 24 days -- (applause) -- 24 days. So, this election -- this election and our fight is a fight for the promise of America, a promise -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back. (Applause.) And ours is a fight for the promise -- the promise of America -- a promise of freedom, of opportunity, and justice not just for some but for all. (Applause.) But what we know is, as we fight to move our nation forward, Donald Trump intends to pull us back to the past. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: But we're not going back. We are not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: So -- and let's -- and -- and we know -- we know what that would look like, right? So, intends to pull us back, including back to a time before workers had the freedom to organize. As president, we will always remember Donald Trump blocked overtime benefits for millions of workers -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- Tyrese talked a bit about this -- and opposed efforts to raise the minimum wage. He appointed union busters to the National Labor Relations Board. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he supported so-called right-to-work laws. And if -- AUDIENCE: Trump is a scab! Trump is a scab! Trump is a scab! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, -- well, here's the thing. Here's the thing. We have a choice here, right? And -- and we're not going back, because we also know that if Donald Trump were reelected, he intends to give tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He wants to impose what in effect is a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that will cost -- and economists have said this -- that will cost a typical American family almost $4,000 a year. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and take us back to a time in our country which most of us remember, when insurance companies, you remember, had the power to deny people coverage based on a preexisting condition. Remember that? AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Deny people -- children who had asthma, a survivor of breast cancer, a grandparent with diabetes. Look, America has tried those failed policies before. And they are failed policies. And we are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. We are not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And instead -- and instead, we fight for a future -- a future where no person has to go broke just because they got sick. And so, when I am president, we will continue to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. We will bring down the cost of prescription drugs not only for some but for all Americans. (Applause.) We -- we fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to organize. (Applause.) And so, when I am president, we will pass the PRO Act and end union busting once and for all. (Applause.) And I'll remind everybody, on all these bills, we got to elect a Congress who supports that -- (applause) -- to be able to actually get that work done. We fight for a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead. And so, when I am president, we will continue to build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build intergenerational wealth for their family. We fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity. And so, when I am president, we will continue to defend Social Security, Medicare, and pensions, just like we have done. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Sixty-four days -- 64 days -- the most important election of our lives and probably one of the most important in the life of our nation. And here's what I'd say to all the brothers and sisters assembled: We know this is going to be a very tight race to the very end. We know -- we know -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I got your back. But I'm telling you, we know how they play. We know what they do. So, let's not pay too much attention to the polls. Let's know, like labor always does: We are out here running like we are the underdog in this race, because we know what we are fighting for. (Applause.) We know what we stand for, and that's why we know what we fight for. (Applause.) And we got some hard work ahead of us. But, again, we all like hard work, because hard work is good work. And to do that hard work, I'm going to count on everyone here, all the leaders here, for your work, for your organizing, knocking on doors, and getting folks to the polls. Because, put bluntly, Michigan, y'all know how to win. (Applause.) You know how to win. You know how to win. So, today, I ask: Detroit, Michigan, are you ready to have your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.) And when we fight -- AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win. God bless you. (Applause.)","","",""

Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! The President. Folks, I've celebrated many Labor Days in Pittsburgh. And it's always good to be back with so many great friends, many of whom flew with me on Air Force One today—represent the unions that have been with me since the beginning of my career. They're not that old, but they—they're—[laughter]—since I was a 29-year-old kid. I want to thank Liz Shuler of the AFL-CIO and Kenny of the IBEW for that strong endorsement. By the way, we have an expression in Delaware. The IBEW, when I ran for President, they're the ones that ""brung me to the dance"" starting off. Not a joke. And Dave McCall and the Steelworkers. Dave, in 1972, Steelworkers were the first union to endorse a 29-year-old kid named Joe Biden who wasn't old enough to be Senator when he got elected. It mattered. A guy named Hughie Carcella was the district president, because we used to have one of the largest labor forces in Claymont, Delaware, and north—over 4,000 workers. And it was—anyway, it all went law—it went south. But Hughie—Hughie went to the national president, I.W. Abel, and he said he wanted me—he wanted me to get endorsed. Everybody thought it was crazy. I literally wasn't old enough to be sworn in the day I got elected. [Laughter] But guess what? President Abel stuck with me. Audience member. That's right! The President. And they got stuck with me for the rest of their—my career. [Laughter] Eric Dean and the Iron Workers. Tim Driscoll of Bricklayers. April Verrett and SEIU. Lee Saunders of AFSCME and a great friend. Where are you, Lee? And Jimmy Williams and the Painters and Allied Trades. And his dad. His dad is a really good man. And Mike Coleman and the Sheet Metal Workers. We've also got some of the best elected officials in America. Governor Josh Shapiro is doing an incredible job. And the great Lieutenant Governor Austin Davis. And one of America's best—where is Ed Gainey? Ed, you're doing a hell of a job. And Sara Innamorato. County executive, I think, is the hardest job in American politics. Everybody knows where you live, and they think you can solve all the problems. You don't have enough money. But I tell you one thing, I'm the first President ever—I used to be a county official when I was 26 years old, and it always bothered me that the county—the State—the Federal Government would send money to the State to be distributed to the county. What the hell is the State going to send to the county for? All the State reps need the money. [Laughter] But guess what? Under my administration, it goes straight to the county. And one of my best friends—my name is Joe Biden; I'm from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Bobby Casey has been a great friend. His dad was a great friend as well. And by the way, we grew up three blocks from one another. Three blocks. And they still worry about us not showing up. [Laughter] And guess what? I was on North Washington Avenue; he was on Adams. Guess what? They've renamed North Washington Avenue down where I lived ""Biden Way."" [Inaudible] And, Bobby—Bob, we'll make sure we get—you get reelected again. And while he couldn't be here, I want to thank his partner in the Senate, John Fetterman. If you're in a foxhole, you want Fetterman in there with you. He couldn't be here today, but guess what? He sent the best part of the family, Gisele. She's here. Let me just say, it means so much to be with a true friend—a true friend: the Vice President and the next great President of the United States of America, Kamala Harris. Look, folks, I come from two neighborhoods where it's not hard to say the word ""union."" But you know what? The fact of the matter is an awful lot of politicians have trouble saying ""union."" [Inaudible]—working people. Guess what? I'm not one of them. Neither is Kamala. We know the simple truth: Wall Street did not build America; the middle class built America, and unions built the middle class. That's a fact. And, by the way, that is a not a slogan. That's a fact. I asked the Treasury Department to do a study, and it shows that when unions do well, all workers in America do better. That's a fact. That's a fact. It's the biggest reason why our economy is the strongest economy in the world today without question—because of unions. You know, my dad, like many of his generation, going into World War II, wasn't able to go to college. My dad was a really well-read guy, and he was always engaged. And he'd come home from work before he'd go back and close up the shop and—for dinner. And the dinner was a place where we had discussions and, incidentally, ate. You know, my dad taught me—my dad would say this all the time: ""Remember, Joey, a job is""—and I give you my word to this—""a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about community. It's about your place in the community. And it's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it."" Well, that's why Kamala and I are so proud—so proud—of the greatest job creation record of any President in a single term in American history: 16 million new jobs so far, 800,000 manufacturing jobs. Eight years ago, how many times you hear about we can no longer be the manufacturing capital of the world? Where the hell is that written? We are the greatest manufacturing city—or county in the world—State in the world—[inaudible]—the world. And we're going to remain that way. And I'll tell you something. Kamala and I are damn proud that we protected the pensions of over 1 million workers and retirees. Remember all those years of promising we were going to do something about it? Well, damn it, we finally did it with the Butch Lewis Act. Over 52,000 workers and retirees across Pennsylvania alone are benefiting from that. Not only did we restore the full amount, we got them their back pay as well. We made them whole again. And as I once said to Barack, ""That's a big deal."" [Laughter] Yes. Long story. [Laughter] You just heard Liz and Kenny describe another big deal. Union workers are rebuilding American infrastructure and building new factories here in America. They told me we couldn't get anything done in infrastructure. A trillion two hundred billion dollars we got done. Remember Trump, for 4 years, promised every month ""Infrastructure Week."" For 4 years, he promised that. He didn't build a damn thing. Nothing. I mean it. Not—nothing. Well, thanks to our infrastructure law, Pennsylvania, so far, has received $17 billion—$17 billion. Over 2,000 projects, from clean water to affordable high-speed internet for every Pennsylvanian, to projects that include $858 million to expand the Montgomery Lock better—to accommodate bigger barges to get millions of tons of goods and—on shelves faster and more reliable and create thousands of union jobs. I was working on the Great Lakes, and I got a call from Bobby—from Senator Casey. He's been—no bigger champion than Casey for this. You know what I call them? I call them the ""Casey Locks."" [Laughter] Not Goldilocks. The Casey Locks. Bobby is also a champion of Pennsylvania's energy communities. We passed what's called the ""Casey credit,"" available to 45 Pennsylvania counties where energy jobs such as coal—where coal mining and—had been before and disappeared, before we came to office. The ""Casey credit"" provides major incentives for companies to build new battery factories, wind turbines, and more to create high-paying jobs in those coal and natural gas communities. And on top of that, there's over $4 billion that private companies have committed to invest in clean energy and advanced manufacturing here in Pennsylvania—$4 billion. And guess what? With your support, I signed an Executive order to make sure large Federal construction projects all use project labor agreements. For folks at home who may be watching this on television—know what project labor agreement is, it's when contractors, subcontractors, and unions put in place before construction begins what the rules are—before it begins. These agreements make sure construction is top-notch, on time, on task, and by the way, on budget. There's another big deal. ""Buy American""—that's been the law since 1930. I've got to admit, I've been around—I'm only 40, but I've been around a long time. [Laughter] But I, quite frankly, until 10 years ago, wasn't aware—you know, back in the thirties, when they were trying to make sure unions could organize and businesses couldn't interfere, they put—a law was passed that said every penny the President gets from the Senate, the House, and Congress to spend on a project, he should hire an American worker and use an American product. But past administrations—[applause]—seriously. Past administrations, including my predecessor, failed to buy American. They shipped jobs overseas where labor was cheaper and brought home the product that was more expensive. But not anymore. Federal projects build American roads, bridges, highways, and they'll be made with American products by American workers. That's why we're creating all these—[applause]—I'm serious. It's simple and basic. That's why we're creating so many good-paying jobs. In fact, we're requiring those kinds of projects to pay Davis-Bacon prevailing wages so they're jobs you can raise a family on. Many of those jobs don't require a college degree. In fact, we expanded registered apprenticeships. Remember all the hell I got for doing that—we got for doing that? Well, guess what? It resulted in hiring over 1 million apprentices since we came to office. And lots of folks don't realize getting an apprenticeship is like getting a college degree. Why? You have to train for 4 or 5 years to get that. And some of the best workers in the world are why the—why we are where we are. You know—[applause]—when you're in Pittsburgh, you're standing with steelworkers. Let's be clear. I believe in American steel companies—American-owned-and-operated steel companies. A simple reason—it's not hyperbole—American steelworkers are the best steelworkers in the world. And I made it clear last time I was in Pittsburgh: United States Steel, an iconic American company for more than a century, is going to remain an American company. I remember as a young Senator why the National Labor Relations Board was sometimes so antilabor. It was set up to help labor, to be prolabor. Well, guess what? That's why one of the most significant things we've done, Kamala and I, is appointing a National Labor—Board—Relations Board that actually believes in unions and believes in recognizing the right to organize. Audience member. Thank you! The President. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. Remember—we have short memories. I'm all for forgiveness. I'm not for this: Trump appointed union busters on that Board. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, that's a fact. But it's real. It affects people's lives. Are we going to let that son of a gun do that again? Audience members. No! The President. Folks, we've made a lot of progress, and Kamala and I are going to build on that progress, and she's going to build on it. I'll be on the sidelines, but I'll do everything I can to help. But look, I'm not joking when I say—this is not a joke. When I said this when I was running in 2020, a lot of people didn't believe me. You did, but a lot didn't believe me. It's all at risk because of Donald Trump, literally. With a stroke of the pen, he can get rid of a lot of this. And do you think this guy gives a damn about your pensions? Audience members. No! The President. No, I'm serious. Do you think he loses even an instant of sleep over it? Audience members. No! The President. Do you think he cares about all the work you do every day and how hard it is? Audience members. No! The President. Do you think he cares about good-paying jobs for hard-working people who built this economy? Audience members. No! The President. Hell—[laughter]—he regards picket lines—he'd rather cross one than walk one. But I have no problem walking a picket line. Never have. Neither—nor does Kamala. We'll always walk aside—alongside you. Union workers built this country. And, again, that's not hyperbole. That's a fact. These are—these are facts. These are not campaign slogans. Let me close with this. Five years ago, I began my campaign for President right here in Pittsburgh. I said one of the reasons I was running was to rebuild the backbone and spine of America—the middle class and working class folks. Not a joke. Think about it. Think about it. Well, 5 years later, we've done just that. I'm back in Pittsburgh on Labor Day again with a simple message as we look at this election. I spelt [spent; White House correction] my whole career believing in unions. I'm not joking when I say that. I'm honored to be considered the most pro-union President ever. And by the way, remember all the talk? ""Biden got elected, and he's going to do a planned economy. We're going to collapse, and there's going to be all this caving in. Interest rates are going to go through the ceiling."" Come on, man. [Laughter] I'm here to tell you it's about increasing the strength of your unions, which it's all about. If you care about hard-working people, just give them a fair shot. Everyone in America deserves a fair shot. No—a fair shot. If you care about the dignity of work—if you care about the dignity of work—and I mean it; it matters—the dignity of work, the way you're treated, the decency. I remember when my great-grandfather was one of the—only the second Catholic elected statewide to the State senate here in Pennsylvania. And I remember they talked about when he—when they were running against him in 1906, they said, ""Guess what?"" They said, ""He's a Molly Maguire."" You know what a Molly Maguire was? Well, those of you who don't, a Molly Maguire, back in the—in the old days, when we Irish and the Catholics came and then the Poles and others that were Catholic—when they came to the United States of America in the beginning, the 1840s and—late 1840s, they made their way down into Pennsylvania, a lot of them. And there—there's a tier in this—in the coal mines. Those guys who got there last ended up being the last people in the coal mines. But a lot of the English owned the coal mines. And what they did was they'd really beat the hell out of the—the mostly Catholic population who was in the mines. Not a joke. Not a joke. But there was a group. They're called the Molly Maguires. And the Molly Maguires, if they'd find out the foreman who was taking advantage of an individual—and they'd literally kill him. Not a joke. And they'd bring his body up and put him on the doorstep of his family. Kind of crude. But I've got to admit, they accused my great-grandfather of being Molly—he wasn't. But we were so damn disappointed. But you know—[laughter]—I—that's a joke. That's a joke. Look, it's about the dignity of work. It's about how you're treated. And when I met with the IBEW when I started off this last campaign first, I said, ""There's two things that—asking of me."" You're—and I said: ""Two things I'm asking of you. One, you've got to open up your unions to more women."" Not joke. ""And, two, to more minorities."" You've done both that. And guess what? Instead of having the support of 30 percent of the American people, it's now over 65 percent of the American people support the American union movement. Look, it really is all about the dignity of work. And there's only—if you care about the dignity of work, there's only one person you have a rational choice with this time, and that's Kamala Harris. Not a—[applause]. Audience members. Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! The President. Let me tell you about this woman. Audience members. Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! The President. I know her. I trust her. Not a joke. I trust her. Number two, the first decision I made the nomination—as nominee in 2020 was selecting her as my Vice President. And by the way, it was the single best decision I made as President of the United States of America. And I was watching something sent to me: When they asked Barack—they said Barack picked me as Vice President because he knew I could be President. Well, I know she'll be a good President. I know it. I've watched her when all the experts, foreign and domestic policy, would give us advice, then we'd sit alone in a room, and she has a backbone like a ramrod. And she has the moral compass of a saint. This woman knows what she's doing. Folks, I promise you, if you elect Kamala Harris as President, it will be the best decision you will have ever made. And Kamala believes, as I do, that unions are the spine of this economy. She'll be a historic pro-union President. So, folks, we've got one more job to do together. Let me ask you: Are you ready to fight? Audience members. Yes! The President. Are you ready to win? Audience members. Yes! The President. Are you ready to elect Kamala Harris our next President of the United States of America? [Applause] And, in the process, are you ready to make Donald Trump a loser again? Audience members. Yes! The President. I've never been more optimistic about America's future. We have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. There's nothing, nothing—I mean this from the bottom of my heart—there's nothing beyond our capacity—nothing—when we do it together. And that means elect my friend, our great Vice President, President of the United States. Kamala Harris. [At this point, Vice President Harris made remarks.]","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374186",11532,"THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, Pittsburgh! (Applause.) Thank you, Joe! (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! THE VICE PRESIDENT: It is good to be in the house of labor. (Applause.) It is good to be in the house of labor. And it is good to be back at IBEW Local 5. (Applause.) And can we please give it up again for our president, Joe Biden? (Applause.) Now, I don't have to tell the brothers and sisters of labor that you really get to know somebody when you're in the middle of a fight, when times are hard, when the forces are mighty, when people don't believe something can get done, and they have a thousand excuses for why it can't get done. And I have spent more time with this extraordinary human being when the cameras were not in the room, when the stakes were high, when the heat was intense. And Joe Biden has always stood with the workers of America and labor unions of America. (Applause.) Always. Always. I've been with him when he'll bring folks into the Oval Office. And you know how Joe can get sometimes. He doesn't spare words. It's good that sometimes the cameras are not in the room when he has those conversations. (Laughter.) Because the thing about the Joe Biden I know -- and I know you know, because he has been a frain- -- friend of labor for so long, for his whole life -- Joe Biden can be quite impatient, and that's a good thing for that kind of leader. (Laughter.) Quite impatient. And I say to all of the friends here, the press that's in the room: History will show what we here know. (Applause.) Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents in the United States that we have ever witnessed. (Applause.) And it comes from his heart. (Applause.) And, you know, Joe and I talk a lot about the fact that we are so proud to be the most pro-union administration in America's history, and it's thanks to your leadership. (Applause.) And, as we know, Joe has still got a lot of work to do, so let's -- let's also understand that. So, I want to thank all the incredible leaders who are here today, including the governor, Shapiro; Lieutenant Governor Davis; Senator Casey, who we will reelect this November -- (applause); Mayor Gainey; President Shuler; President Cooper; all the leaders of labor who are here; all the union members who are here. So, I'll just get right to a few points. I love Labor Day. (Laughter.) I love celebrating Labor Day. And Pittsburgh, of course, is a cradle of the American labor movement. (Applause.) It is the birthplace of the AFL, headquarters of the Steelworkers, home to Fire Fighters Local 1, and, of course, the historic IBEW Local 5. (Applause.) For more than 150 years, the brothers and sisters of labor have helped lead the fight for fair pay, better benefits, and safe working conditions, and every person in our nation has benefited from that work. You know, everywhere I go, I tell people, ""You may not be a union member, but you better thank unions for that five-day work week. Thank unions for sick leave. Thank unions for paid family leave. Thank unions for your vacation time."" (Applause.) Because when union wages go up, everybody's wages go up. When union workplaces are safer, all workplaces are safer. When unions are strong, America is strong. (Applause.) And we are clear: Not only has Pittsburgh shaped the history of America's labor movement, today you are also shaping its future. (Applause.) In 2021, with my dear friend, the Secretary, Marty Walsh, who the president appointed to be Secretary of Labor, he and I hosted a meeting right here in this Local, and it was part of the White House Labor Task Force that I lead. That day, we met with a group of computer programmers who were working to form a union. One month later, they signed their contract and became the first -- one of the first technology unions in our nation -- (applause) -- standing on the shoulder of all those who have been here and fought the good fight. So, Pittsburgh, I r- -- I remind us of that to say, together, we are fighting to build an economy that works for all working people. (Applause.) And that has always been the vision of the labor movement. And that is the vision of our campaign. (Applause.) You know, in this election, there are two very different visions for our nation: one, ours, focused on the future; the other focused on the past. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: We fight for the future. (Applause.) We fight for a future of dignity, respect, and opportunity for all people. (Applause.) We fight knowing it's some backward thinking for those folks to have been suggesting for years that the -- the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. You know, that's the stuff they're pushing -- that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down -- when we know the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up -- (applause) -- who you lift up. Do you fight for workers? Do you fight for families? Do you fight for those who must be seen and heard and deserve the dignity that comes with hard work? (Applause.) That's what we fight for. And when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.) So, we're 64 days out from this election. (Laughter.) Ballots in Pennsylvania will start dropping in 14 days -- (applause) -- 14 days. And this election is, as much as anything else, a fight for the promise of America -- (applause) -- for the promise of America. We love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. And we know it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country, and that's what this election is about, and about the promise of America. And I don't need to tell unions what the promise looks like. It's what you do every day. (Applause.) But as we fight to move forward, Donald Trump is trying to pull us backward, including back to a time before workers had the freedom to organize. AUDIENCE MEMBER: He's going to jail! AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, the courts will handle that, and we will handle November. How about that? (Laughter and applause.) We'll handle November. Let the courts handle that other thing. But we're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. And -- AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And one of the ways -- one of the ways we're going to guarantee we don't go back is that we remember. Right? It is important to remember what that was and what it is. Remember, as president, Donald Trump blocked overtime benefits for millions of workers. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He opposed efforts to raise the minimum wage. As the president said, he appointed union busters to the National Labor Relations Board. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And don't forget, he supported so-called right-to-work laws. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And if Donald Trump were to be reelected, he intends to give more tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He wants to impose what, in effect, would be a national sales tax. I call it the ""Trump national sales tax"" on everyday products and basic necessities that would cost a typical American family -- the economists have said this -- almost $4,000 a year. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to repeal the Affordable Care Act AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and take us back to what we remember -- because it wasn't that long ago -- was a time when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was? Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes. Well, look, America has tried those failed policies before, and we are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And instead -- and instead, we fight for a future where no person has to go broke just because they get sick. (Applause.) And so, building on the work of President Joe Biden and I and the work we have done in the White House, we will continue to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and make prescription drugs affordable for all Americans. We -- (applause) -- we -- we fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to organize. And we will pass the PRO Act and end union busting once and for all, and Bob Casey will help us do that. (Applause.) We -- we see and know and fight for a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead. (Applause.) And so, we will continue to build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has an opportunity to buy a home or start a business or build intergenerational wealth and have a future that matches their dreams and ambitions and aspirations. (Applause.) Because, of course, that's the nature of who we are as Americans. We have dreams. We can see what is possible, unburdened by what has been. We have aspirations. We have ambitions. And the system that is a good system is one that supports that and allows people the opportunity to go where they can see and imagine themselves to be. That's what I'm talking about when I talk about an opportunity economy. We fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity, and so we will continue to defend Social Security and Medicare and pensions. (Applause.) And pensions. And pensions. (Applause.) And we will continue to strengthen America's manufacturing sector. And on that point, the president mentioned it, U.S. Steel is an historic American company, and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies. And I couldn't agree more with President Biden, U.S. Steel should remain American-owned and American-operated. (Applause.) And I will always have the back of America's steelworkers -- (applause) -- and all of America's workers. So, friends, 64 days until the most [important] election of our lives, and probably one of the most important in the life of our nation, truly. And we know this is going to be a tight race to the very end. It's going to be a tight race to the very end. So, let's not pay too much attention to those polls. Because as unions and labor knows best, we know what it's like to be the underdog. And we are the underdog in this race, and we have some hard work, then, ahead of us. But here's the beauty of us in this room: We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. (Applause.) And so, in this fight, I will continue to count on the strength, the determination, and the hard work of the leaders in this room to knock on doors, to get folks to the polls, and -- bluntly put, because the people in here do it -- to help us win Pennsylvania. (Applause.) So, today, I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in freedom? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in opportunity? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in the promise of America? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: And are we ready to fight for it? AUDIENCE: Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And when we fight -- AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win. God bless you. God bless America.

Good afternoon, Savannah. (Applause.) Good afternoon. Oh, good afternoon. Oh, it's good to be back in Savannah. Good afternoon. (Applause.) (Laughs.) Can we please hear it for Katelyn and her incredible -- (applause) -- for her incredible leadership? Look, when I look out at our young leaders like Katelyn, I know our future is so bright. It is so bright. (Applause.) I want to thank Mayor Johnson. (Applause.) Thank you for your -- there you are. We've been hanging out for the last two days. Mayor, I thank you so very much for your leadership. Thank you. (Applause.) Congresswoman Nikema Williams, the chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia -- (applause) -- for your friendship and your sisterhood. And to all the leaders with us today, good afternoon. Good afternoon. (Applause.) Good afternoon. I also bring greetings from our president and a great friend of the state of Georgia, Joe Biden. (Applause.) And let us also send our love to the great president from the state of Georgia, Jimmy Carter. (Applause.) So, Georgia -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you! THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back. (Applause.) I love you back. And we have 68 days to go until this election -- 68 days to go. (Applause.) And I think you all have spent your time here sacrificing all your other obligations to be here together, us as one community, knowing we all have so much more in common than what separates us. And I thank you for taking that time. (Applause.) And, listen -- so, we're here to speak truth, and one of the things that we know: This is going to be a tight race until the very end. Okay? So, let's not pay too much attention to the polls, because we are running as the underdog. Okay? (Applause.) And we have some hard work ahead of us, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. And with your help, we are going to win this November. (Applause.) We are going to win this November. Yes, we will. So, look, Georgia, let me say, I'm no stranger to tough fights. Before I was elected vice president, before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, an elected district attorney. (Applause.) And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.) So, every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I spoke five words: ""Kamala Harris, for the people."" (Applause.) My entire career, I've only had one client: the people. (Applause.) I stood for women and children against predators who abused them. I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. (Applause.) I fought against cartels who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings. And I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges -- (applause) -- for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due, and for seniors facing elder abuse. And I will tell you, those fights were not easy, and neither were the elections that put me in those offices. But we never gave up, because the future is always worth fighting for. (Applause.) Always. And that is the fight we are in right now: a fight for America's future. We -- we fight for a future with affordable childcare, paid leave, and affordable health care. (Applause.) And on that last subject, let's finally expand Medicaid in Georgia -- (applause) -- so people can take their child to a doctor or go to an emergency room without going into medical debt. (Applause.) We -- we fight for a future where we build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth and intergenerational wealth -- (applause) -- and a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families. (Applause.) So, when I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes. AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And -- love you back. Love you back. (Laughs.) (Applause.) And I will tell you, when we get this done together, my friend -- (laughter) -- and when I am president, I will take on the bad actors who exploit a crisis -- (applause) -- to rip off consumers on everyday items -- who rip off consumers on everyday items, like groceries. I will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs and insulin for all Americans. (Applause.) I will take on the high cost of housing and work with developers to cut the red tape and build millions of new homes. (Applause.) And I will give 100 million Americans a tax cut, including $6,000 to families during the first year of their child's life -- (applause) -- understanding folks just need a little help from time to time. And it's not about just getting by; it's about getting ahead. Six thousand dollars in the first year of a child's life to help pay for that car seat or the crib or the baby clothes. (Applause.) And unlike Donald Trump, I will always put the middle-class and working-class families first. (Applause.) Always. I come from the middle class; I know what I'm talking about. AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And, Savannah, so -- but we got some work to do. Okay? We got some work to do, because we know Donald Trump has a very different plan. He has a very different plan. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just look at his Project 2025 agenda. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. If he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. He intends -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he wants to impose what, in effect, is a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities. And it will cost -- the economists will tell you -- it will cost a typical American family nearly $4,000 a year. So, Georgia, on top of all of this, if Donald Trump wins in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- to take us back to a time when insurance companies -- AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not -- we're going forward. (Laughs.) AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And the reason we know we can't go back -- to your point, the reason we know we can't go back: On the issue of the Affordable Care Act, remember what that was like before we had the Affordable Care Act? AUDIENCE: Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Remember when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions? Remember what that was like? Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes. So, yeah, we're not going back. (Applause.) We're not going back. We're not going back. And we will move forward. (Applause.) Ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom, like the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.) And understand how we got here. When he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did just as he intended. And now more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban, including Georgia. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: In fact, every state in the South except for Virginia has a Trump abortion ban. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And think about that -- many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. That is immoral -- immoral. (Applause.) And let us all agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. (Applause.) Come on. Come on. Come on. And if he wins, Donald Trump will go further. He will sign a national abortion ban, you best believe. And he would create a national antiabortion coordinator and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions. It's right there in Project 2025. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Simply put: They are out of their minds. (Applause.) Why don't they trust women? Well, we trust women. (Applause.) And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. (Applause.) And across our nation, in addition to that, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won fundamental freedoms and rights. (Applause.) (Protester interruption.) Hey, let me -- let me ju- -- let me just say something. Let -- hold on. Hold up. Hold up for a second. Hold up for a second. Let me -- let me just say something. Let me just say something. We are fighting for our democracy. Everyone has a right and should have their voices heard. I am speaking now, but on the subject, I will say this. The president and I are working around the clock. We have got to get a hostage deal done and get a ceasefire done now. (Applause.) So, back to this election and Donald Trump. So, in addition to the fight on the fundamental freedom to make decisions about one's own body, I have been traveling our country, and the people of Georgia know what I know: There is a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, including the freedom to vote -- (Protestor interruption.) -- the freedom to be safe from gun violence, and an attack on the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.) And we will fight against all of that, including the freedom to live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis. (Applause.) Here is the thing. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now, Savannah, the baton is in our hands. (Applause.) So, we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks and red flag laws. (Applause.) So much is on the line in this election. So much is on the line. And understand, this is not 2016 or 2020. Things are different. A lot is the same when we think about the issues, and then there is significant differences. The stakes in 2024 are even higher, because consider that the United States Supreme Court recently just basically told the former president that, going forward, he will be effectively immune, no matter what he does in the White House. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now just imagine -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: Lock him up! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, the -- the courts are going to take care of that. We are going to get him out of -- we are going to elect ourselves and everybody here in November. (Applause.) But I mention the Supreme Court ruling because understand what this means. Just imagine. Before there was at least the threat of consequence. Understand what it now means, and imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Imagine what that means when you consider he has openly vowed that, if reelected, on day one, he will be a dictator -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- that he would end -- that he would end the independence of the Department of Justice so he could have unchecked power and seek vengeance against people who disagree with him. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He even called for termination of the United States Supreme -- the cou- -- the -- the supreme land [law] of our nation: the United States Constitution. Think about what that means. And let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States of America. (Applause.) Never again. So, it all comes down to this. We are all here together, spending this time together because we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) And we know the privilege and pride -- the privilege and pride that comes with being American. (Applause.) And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. (Applause.) That is how we realize the promise of America. Georgia, for the past two election cycles, voters in this very state, you who are here, have delivered. You sent two extraordinary senators to Washington, D.C. (Applause.) You sent President Biden and me to the White House. (Applause.) You showed up, you knocked on doors, you registered folks to vote, and you made it happen. You did that. You did that. (Applause.) And so, now we are asking you to do it again. (Applause.) Let's do it again. Let's do it again. So, Savannah, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe an opportunity? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.) And when we fight -- AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)","","",""

To the staff that's here -- my -- my previous job to this was, of course, public school teacher and coach, which I wear with pride. To all of you, thank you. Thanks for having us in your school. And thanks to all teams that are here. I think you kind of embody this idea -- and the vice president talks a lot about it -- each of our individual talents, what we can contribute, but something bigger than ourselves when you get together. Your single instrument alone is an amazing thing, but as part of this band, it becomes really amazing. And then to see a school community, each and every one of these teams -- I said I coach football a lot -- but all of this is part of doing something bigger. And I think having us in here, stressing why the vice president says it often, that education is the key to the middle class, a pathway to the middle class. And it shouldn't be burdening you with debt; it should give you an opportunity to get there. So, I think when we can get into a public school like this, when we're able to see you and tell you, it's not just -- the teachers here tell you. They know; they do this work. It's not a cliché. This is truly about building towards the future, and you're that future. And so, when we're in a room like this, it lifts everybody's spirits; it lifts the country's spirits. And the vice president talks about that often, about the positive and the joyful work that we can do and the things that we're trying to make sure happen. So, I'm just grateful that you have us here. I'm grateful to be part of the team with a really great head coach here in your next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughter.) So, you know, I've been hearing about you incredible young leaders for quite some time -- from the players, to those who are bringing joy, to everybody in the stands, to the music that you guys are creating. And so, we wanted to come by just to let you know that our country is counting on you -- all of you. You are leaders by the very fact that you all are here in this room doing what you do at this incredible school, doing it as one big team, understanding all of the different parts that fit together to create a team. You are doing some of the best work any leader can do. And we're so proud of you, and we're counting you. Your generation, all that you guys stand for, everything you have at stake is what is going to propel our country into the next era of what we can do and what we can be. And I want to say to you that you must always lead as you have chosen to lead, understanding you don't have to ask anybody's permission to lead. And I think you all have figured that out. You've decided to be a leader. And in doing that, you are also role models. Right? Welcome to the role model club. (Laughter.) And being a role model -- right? -- means that there are going to be members of your family, people who live in your neighborhood, your classmates who watch you to see, ""Oh, that's how it's done."" And in that way, you are showing what hard work can achieve, what discipline can achieve, what teamwork can achieve. And that's the stuff of great leadership -- all of you. And so, we wanted to come by to remind you that our nation is counting on you. We're so proud of you and everything you have achieved. And I will tell you, I was in band when I was your age. (Laughter.) So, I know a little bit about -- you know, Coach knows about the players. Right? And all that you all are doing, it requires a whole lot of rehearsal, a whole lot of practice, long hours. Right? Sometimes you hit the note; sometimes you don't. (Laughter.) Right? But all that practice makes for beautiful music. And that is a metaphor that is symbolic for everything that you all will do in your lives, which is you're going to show what a winning team looks like; you're going to show what it means to put yourself out on the field, to put yourself in front of people, to have the confidence to do it. Sometimes you're going to hit the step right; sometimes you're not. Sometimes you're going to win the game; sometimes you may not. But, you know, you never let any circumstance knock you down or slow you down. You just keep going at it. That's who you are, and that's why we are so confident in everything that you are doing and will continue to do for our country. So, just keep being you and all of the excellence that you're bringing to everything you do. Okay? All right. See you later. (Applause.)","","",""

[cheers and applause] Thank you. Good afternoon. Welcome uh welcome to Detroit Rock City, as we say. [cheers and applause] And uh no matter what your background is, what your politics are, any of that. Before we get going here, those of you serving, who have served, I'm sure I speak forever when I say thank you for your service. [cheers and applause] Um I'd just like to talk for two seconds about my service and there's a point to this. So if it sounds like a little toot of my own horn or a pat on my back, there's a point to this. Uh probably some of the most rewarding, the most rewarding things I've done in my life and career have been being able to perform for our troops all over the world. From Kosovo, Germany, Afghanistan, Iraq, UAE, Turkey, Italy, England, all across the U.S. But how did that start? [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. But I want to tell you a little story of how that started. Many moons ago, some of you younger ones maybe weren't even walking yet. There was a horrible attack, a terrorist attack in Yemen on one of our ships called the USS Cole, where 17 sailors lost their lives. And when they were getting towed out of that harbor, you can imagine their brothers and sisters, people serving with them were pretty upset, pretty pissed off, but the upper brass said they could play patriotic music while they're getting pulled out of there. And one of those wise guys put on a little song by myself called American Badass, and they were pretty upset. I got a few pictures with these guys after losing 17 of their brothers and sisters. They got F Yemen across their chests and a couple middle fingers in the air. And it gave me chills when I found out about it. But more importantly, my mother, who's with me today, just celebrated her 80th birthday. [applause] It was her, who I might note that her father, my grandfather and my uncle and her brother served in World War II and Vietnam, suggested she said, ""You know, should do something to help out with them."" And this was kind of before all the crazy wars and everything in the Middle East broke out. And I said, ""You know what? You're right."" And I was raised to be very patriotic and love my country. And, and so it just happened we were playing in Virginia where we have a big presence in our military and the Navy and I was able to play a show there and donate that money to the families of those 17 sailors that lost their lives. And that was because one reason, because of my mom, Susan Ritchie. So how about an applause for mama Rock who's here tonight? [cheers and applause] She's a little shy. She's a little shy. Probably back there cutting it up with the president. [laughter] I also apologize, I did not get the dress memo today clearly. But enough of me rambling on here. There she is. Hi mom. Love you. Now, enough of me rambling on. Once again, welcome to our beautiful city, Detroit. I'm so proud to be from in and around here. It's great to be back, especially with so many of you great patriots. So let's bring on the man now, right? Probably want to hear somebody else speak. [cheers] Well, how about we give a big old Detroit welcome, a huge military salute and welcome to our 45th and soon to be 47th President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump. [music: Lee Greenwood, God Bless the USA.] TRUMP: Thank you. Having Kid Rock, sometimes referred to as Bob, I call him Bob, but he's a great guy. I'll tell you that, he's a great guy and a talented one, and it's an honor to be with all of you incredible patriots, really an honor, a great one. And I'm thrilled to be here in Detroit with the incredible men and women of our National Guard. Very special people. I've had no greater honor in life than to serve as your Commander in Chief, and you are always ready and always there for us and for the President of the United States, you are always there for me, I will tell you and I'm always going to be there for you. [cheers and applause] Thank you. And we're doing very well as you probably see. And hopefully I can say when I'm back in the White House, I'll get you the support, funding, training, and equipment you need, and I will get you the pay raises that you've really deserved for a long time. [cheers and applause] We'll get it taken care of. For a long time. I want to thank the Chairman of the National Guard Association of the United States, Major General Janson D. Boyles, and also Vice Chair Major General Jimmie Cole. [applause] Thank you both. Thank you very much. I also want to thank members of Congress, very special warriors and patriots, they're very strong people. They love our country. Lisa McClain. Where's Lisa? She's so incredible.[applause] Lisa, thank you. Thank you, Lisa. John James. [applause] John, thank you. John James is a star and doing really well. Thanks John. Tim Walberg and Michael Waltz. Thank you very much Michael and Tim. And again, I want to thank Kid Rock for being here. He's really been a great friend of mine for a long time. Each and every one of the guard members here today inherits the proud spirit of the citizen soldier running all the way back to the Minutemen who stood against tyranny at Concord Bridge. Has everybody heard of Concord Bridge? Yes, I think so. You carry forward the legacy of Old Hickory division that earned more medals of honor than any division in the army in World War I and the North Dakota Guardsmen who've walked through hellfire at Guadalcanal. [applause] And it was the Air National Guard that thundered into the skies to defend us on 9/11. We all remember that all too well. And when our country is hit by fire, flood, or vicious storm, America turns to the National Guard because we know we can always count on you. We always can count on you. I've counted on you a lot. The National Guard is America's first and last line of defense, and you do not get the credit you deserve. But actually, you do because down deep everybody knows it. You get a lot of credit in your own way, a little bit different. But we really respect and appreciate the job you do. Thank you to every Guardsman for your selfless service. I want to thank also our amazing National Guard families because, especially the spouses and the children—[cheers and applause], I mean, let's face it, without which you would never be the same. You'd never be the same. But they sacrifice so much. All of us in this room have something very special in common. We're all proud, hard-working citizens who have stepped forward to defend American freedom. And we continue to do that. And it's why I'm here today because America's future is under threat like never before right at this moment in my opinion, our country is at the most dangerous level we've ever been. And I hate to say this, but we have a president who went on vacation a week ago and now he came back and he went on vacation again. And we have people that are fighting all over the place and threatening our country as we speak. I don't think we've ever been closer to World War III than we are right now. It's a terrible thing. Our country is being destroyed by a radical political class that sends our guardsmen and women to defend the borders of distant foreign nations while they surrender our own borders to an invasion right here at home, the likes of which we've never seen before. You miss birthdays and holidays deploying overseas in the global war on terror. Only Kamala Harris is letting terrorists come into our country at record numbers and letting Jihadists pour into our homeland by the thousands and thousands and thousands. Can't do that. And while you have risked your lives to defend our rights and liberties and our borders, our opponents have waged war on those liberties from the White House, attacking free speech, censoring dissidents, and trying to put their political opposition in jail. Never happened before. I'm in this fight to defeat the corrupt political class in Washington that's hurting you very badly, whether we know it or not, and to reclaim America's future as a free and sovereign nation ruled by the American people. When I'm back in the White House, we will expel the warmongers, the profiteers, and take over our government and we will restore world peace and it will be again, peace through strength. [cheers and applause] On day one, I will seal the border and I will stop the invasion of millions of people into our country. [applause] We will find and remove the terrorists and jihadists who have infiltrated our soil. And under my leadership, we'll bring back the values that you enlisted your lives to defend: sovereignty, liberty, free speech, and fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. We are not just going to make America great again. We're going to make American democracy great again. We're going to bring it back. My opponent, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are promising the exact opposite. They want endless war, open borders, voting rights, and free healthcare for illegal aliens, Soviet-style price control, censorship, unlimited migration from terrorist hotspots and unchecked power for the deep state. This fight is no longer between Democrats and Republicans. This is a fight between communism and freedom. It's very serious fight. That's why millions of traditional Democrats, including FDR Democrats, JFK Democrats, independents, and old-fashioned liberals are joining our movement. Our poll numbers are great. We're uniting forces to end the endless foreign wars, stop the censorship, end weaponization of our government, defend our borders, rebuild our middle class, protect the health of our children and, above all, to restore our republic and vanquish the corruption that's all over Washington D.C. right now. Three days ago, I was honored to receive the endorsement of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. We're very proud. [applause] Thank you. We're very proud to welcome Bobby to our cause. He's really a terrific guy. He's a terrific person and he's going to do a lot of great things. I have no doubt about it. He's got some very good ideas. Some ideas that people weren't listening to, it's turned out to be right. And today I'm honored to officially welcome another true American patriot, a 17-year veteran of the Hawaii Army National Guard, a four-term Democrat congresswoman. Very, very popular. The former vice chair of the National Democratic Party and a 2020 Democrat candidate for the United States presidency. She was a very good candidate. Every time she ran, she was good. She did well. She decided to leave. She couldn't take it anymore. But she is very special. And I didn't know this, but she was a lieutenant colonel. That's not bad, lieutenant colonel. [laughter] Not bad. I didn't know that. I just found out. I said, ""Put it down. You gotta put that down. That's bigger—that's better than all the other stuff I read."" But no, she's a special person. She's got great common sense, great spirit. She loves our country and she loves the people in this room. Tulsi Gabbard. Tulsi, please. [cheers and applause] TULSI GABBARD: Thank you very much. TRUMP: Have a good time. GABBARD: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Aloha. CROWD: Aloha GABBARD: I know we got Hawaii in the house here. [cheers] There we go. It is a privilege to be here with all of you, my brothers and sisters in uniform, especially on this day of all days. I had the privilege of joining President Trump this morning at Arlington Cemetery, where he joined two Gold Star families and loved ones of Staff Sergeant Hoover and Sergeant Gee, both of whom were two of the 13 killed in the Abbey Gate attack three years ago today in Kabul. And I can tell you, as we were there, as he laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, joining these Marines loved ones, I felt the sorrow that he shared with them in their loss. I felt and saw his sincere appreciation for these servicemen and women who paid the ultimate price and their loved ones who continue to grieve to this day. This is personal for me as I know it is for so many of you here. This is real. It's not just words. I first deployed to Iraq in 2005 with the Hawaii Army National Guard as a member of Charlie Med. [applause] As those of you who were deployed during that time know, it was at the height of the war, and sadly, we took many casualties. And every day we were confronted with that high human cost of war and that sadness as we boarded the plane when we left, that we were leaving some of our brothers and sisters behind only to lose others when we got home to suicide. So I mean what I say when I share with you that I know that President Trump understands the grave responsibility that a president and Commander in Chief bears for every single one of our lives. Whether you're a soldier, you're an airman, a Marine, sailor, or a Coastie, he keeps us in his heart in the decisions that he makes. We saw this through his first term in the presidency when he not only didn't start any new wars, he took action to de-escalate and prevent wars. He exercised the courage that we expect from our Commander in Chief in exhausting all measures of diplomacy, having the courage to meet with adversaries, dictators, allies, and partners alike in the pursuit of peace, seeing war as a last resort. The truth is, as we head towards our decision as a country in November. The same cannot be said about Kamala Harris. In fact, the opposite is true and we are living through this reality today as this administration has us facing multiple wars on multiple fronts and regions around the world and closer to the brink of nuclear war than we ever have been before. This is one of the main reasons why I'm committed to doing all that I can to send President Trump back to the White House, where he can once again serve us as our Commander-in-Chief. [cheers and applause] Because I am confident that his first task will be to do the work, to walk us back from the brink of war. We cannot be prosperous unless we are at peace and we can't live free as long as we have a government that is retaliating against its political opponents and undermining our civil liberties, weaponizing our very institutions against those they deem as a threat. Kamala Harris has done this over the last three and a half years. She won't hesitate to continue that if she is elected as president. President Trump has been their first and foremost target in this because they don't want us as voters to even have the option to vote for him. I've been their most recent target. Added to a secret domestic terror watch list after exposing the truth about what kind of dangers we would face if Kamala Harris is elected as president. We as Americans must stand together to reject this anti-freedom culture of political retaliation and abuse of power. We can't allow our country to be destroyed by politicians who will put their own power ahead of the interests of the American people, our freedom and our future. [applause] I am proud to stand here before you today, whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, or an independent, if you love our country as I do, if you cherish peace and freedom as we do, I invite you to join me in doing all that we can to save our country and elect President Donald J. Trump and send him back to the White House to do the tough work of saving our country and serving the people. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much, Mr. President. TRUMP: Well, thank you Tulsi. I heard that might happen, but I wasn't sure. And it happened, because she's really an amazing, really an amazing person. So I look forward to working with Tulsi and everybody. Everybody in this room actually. And as Tulsi mentioned, early this morning, Tulsi and I were at Arlington National Cemetery with the families of service members who lost their lives in the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that we withdrew, but the way they did it. We were going to do it with dignity and strength. We were in the process of getting out. We would've never given up Bagram, one of the biggest air bases in the world, one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. We gave it up. We gave it. We gave them everything. China took it over. China now occupies it. Can you imagine? The longest, most powerful runways, I think eight feet of concrete down, and we gave it all up. Spent billions and billions of dollars years ago building it. One hour away and we're gone. And now China occupies it. Today marks the three-year anniversary of the terrorist attack at Abbey Gate. Now, we say Abbey Gate, a lot of people don't know what that means. It means Afghanistan that left 13 American service members dead, dozens more badly wounded and many innocent civilians also killed and injured. Hundreds of people killed. Never been anything like it. It's the wrong base. Shouldn't have taken the soldiers out first. Should have taken the soldiers out last. That's where you'd want to be. They took the soldiers out first and they had a field day at our expense and our reputation. We will never forget those brave warriors who made the supreme sacrifice for our country. They will live in our hearts forever. And to all the gold star families, our gratitude is everlasting, will be everlasting always. We will honor their memory by restoring a government that puts the American people first. Caused by Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, the humiliation in Afghanistan set off the collapse of American credibility and respect all around the world. And the fake news doesn't want to talk about it. They don't even talk about the three-year anniversary. Terrible word to use, but that's what they're calling it, an anniversary. It's really, I think of anniversary is a little bit different, but it's three years now and the fake news doesn't even talk about it. Our country will never be safe again until we have fired those responsible for this disaster. Nobody fired. Worst, most embarrassing in my opinion, the most embarrassing day in the history of our country. It gave us Russia going into Ukraine. It gave us the October 7th attack on Israel. Because it gave us lack of respect. We're not respected. We were respected very much four years ago. We're not respected now. The voters are going to fire Kamala and Joe on November 5th, we hope. And when I take office we'll ask for the resignations of every single official. [cheers and applause] We'll get the resignations of every single senior official who touched the Afghanistan calamity to be on my desk at noon on Inauguration Day. You know you have to fire people. You have to fire people when they do a bad job. We never fire anybody. You gotta fire them like on The Apprentice. You are fired. You did a lousy job. You did a terrible, terrible disservice to our country. You get fired when that happens. Nobody got fired. Nobody ever gets fired in this administration. It's amazing. All the bad things that have happened. Nobody ever gets fired. The problem is when you fire somebody, they always end up writing a book about you. [laughter] I've had more books written about me. I fire a lot of people when they don't do a good job. I get a book written about me by all these losers that get fired. [laughter] Every crisis Kamala and Biden have created on the world stage can turn around very quickly and we're going to turn it around. But only we need strong leadership. We need a big victory. November 5th will be the most important day, my opinion in the history of our country. [cheers] Be the most important day. In four short years, thank you, under the Trump administration we built, you know it. You know it better than anybody. Rebuilt the US military. We obliterated ISIS. So ISIS was going to take five years. ""Sir, I don't know if you're going to be able to do it in five years."" Five years we have those beautiful jets for $150 million apiece and they have knives and rifles. I don't understand why. I traveled. You know that I traveled to Iraq. Late at night, I got in, I traveled. They said, ""Sir, would you do us a favor? Close your windows. We're turning off the lights. We're getting ready to land in Iraq, at a great base in Iraq."" And I went because I wanted to see why we're not winning against ISIS. We've been fighting them for 20 years. And I was told by my Washington DC generals that it will take five years. ""Five years, sir."" I said, ""I don't get it."" And I went there and I met real generals. And you know the story, you've probably heard the story, but I had one in particular, Raisin Caine. I said, ""Raisin Caine? Your name's Raisin?"" ""Yes, sir. They call me Raisin Caine."" ""What's your first name?"" ""Dan. But they call me Raisin, sir."" ""So your name's Raisin Caine?"" ""Yes."" ""I love you. This is what I'm looking for. I'm looking for Raisin Caine."" And anyway, we sat down and we had a meeting. He said, ""Would you like to rest?"" ""No, I don't need resting. Unlike other people that we know."" [laughter] We don't need to rest. He'd rest and then leave. There'd be no meeting. I said, ""Let's go now."" I said, ""How do we beat these guys?"" ""Sir, we can do it quickly."" I said, ""No. They say it's going to take a long time. How can you do it?"" ""Four weeks, sir."" "" What?"" ""We can do it in four weeks, sir."" They didn't use our resources. They wanted to be politically correct. They didn't fly out of areas where they thought the country may be a little angry at us, even though we support those countries and we can do it in four weeks, sir. Well, what are you going to do? We're going to have auxiliary airports—you know—military ports. You know all about them. Sort of portables. I think he called them, but they're out in the desert all over the place. We want to use them and we'll use here. But they wanted to fly from here, and it's a long distance, sir. By the time we got there, we had to come back. I said, ""So what would you do?"" He said, ""Well, I'd leave from seven places and we'll hit them from the left. We'll hit them from the right. And we'll hit them underneath and on top. We'll hit them so much. They won't know what the hell is happening, sir."" ""And four weeks we'll do it, sir."" ""Four weeks? They said five years."" ""Four weeks is all we need, sir."" And that's what it took. Can you believe it? I said, ""Go ahead."" I made a couple of phone calls first. I said, is this guy serious? Is he serious? He did it. He knocked it out. He knocked it out. So I can tell you about some of those, what a period of time that was. And I tell that story sometimes because I want to just say, we have an unbelievable military when we have the right leader. [applause] We have an unbelievable military. Really true. And they're not going woke. Maybe a few people on top or woke, but those guys, they'll never be aw woke. They could be put in a room and preached to for the rest of their lives and they won't go woke. And we know them. I saw them. I saw them. What they did. I saw what they did—what they did with ISIS. We knocked out 100% quickly of the ISIS caliphate because we decided to fight. We have the greatest people in the world. We have the best equipment in the world. Now, we did give about $85 billion worth of it to Afghanistan. You know that Afghanistan is one of the largest sellers of military equipment in the world? They sell the stuff that we stupidly left there. We left them $85 billion worth of brand new tanks and planes and even goggles. They didn't fight at night. You know why? They couldn't see. Now they can fight at night. It's not even believable how stupid these people were to allow this to happen to our country, and we became a laughing stock all over the world. And we buried 13 soldiers. They never mentioned the 45 soldiers that just were so badly hurt, obliterated, legs, arms, face. They don't mention. We left Americans behind. We left all of that equipment behind. And if we would've left from Bagram where you have hundreds of acres as opposed to a small little airport in the middle of the city where everybody just came in and it was a mess. You wouldn't have had any of the problems. But you should have again, taken the military out last. If I asked a five-year-old child, ""What do you think?"" Here's the facts. Give him one minute. ""Would you take the military out first or?"" ""Sir, I'd take the military out last of course."" But our guys didn't do that. But I just—it's embarrassing to even talk about it. And I wasn't there. You had another group there, but it's a very big embarrassment because I love the country. I want our country to be respected. And we lost a lot of respect at that moment. And it's so easy. It was so easy. Because we were getting out, but we were getting out with strength and dignity. Think of it. 18 months, not one soldier was killed under mine. And I spoke to Abdul. I told Abdul, ""You can't do that. Can't do it. It's going to be bad, Abdul."" [laughter] And he said, ""Your Excellency, but why do you send me a picture of my house?"" ""Oh, did I send that to you? [cheers and applause] I didn't. Did I send you a picture? Did I send you a picture? I don't remember that Abdul."" But, and honestly, he was fine. 18 months, they were knocking out our soldiers, one by one, especially under Obama, Barack Hussein Obama. They were knocking out our soldiers one by one, snipers. We didn't have one soldier killed, even shot at in 18 months. And then these guys took over and big lack of respect. But they had a lot of respect for us during that period. Think of that. Isn't that amazing? Not one soldier was shot at, let alone killed. Nobody killed. But I'm proud to be the first president in decades who started no new wars. And the reason I started no new wars is they respected the people in this room. [applause] It's true. You don't want to have wars. I ended wars. I could have been in a mess like you have right now. You have every place. The whole world is blowing up. And World War III, if something doesn't happen fast. And that's going to be a World War like no others because of nuclear power and other power that's out there. But we had no wars. Very proud of that. I finished a couple of wars and I got troops out between Turkey. If you take a look, Turkey and Syria, remember we had 5,000 soldiers in between two armies, and I took them out. I said, ""Wait a minute."" I called a couple of generals, I said, ""How do 5,000 soldiers do when you have one army of 400,000 people, another army of 300,000 people, and they're in the middle, can they do well?"" They said, ""It's not going to be good, sir."" I say, ""Get him the hell out of there. That border's been there for 2,000 years. They've been fighting over it."" The fake news back there. They hit me hard. They said, ""He removed—"" You know what happened? Nothing. They just kept it the way it's been for 2,000 years under different names and saved a lot of lives. Would've been bad. But I did a lot of that, and I was very good at using a telephone. We didn't have to send soldiers and kill everybody, although we had some of that too. You know that. With Russia. Where they came at us, I can't do that. Came at us again. I said, ""You can't do that."" They came us at us the third time and you know what happened. A lot of people. People don't talk about it, but they know about it. And they learn not to play around with us. They learn that. Because again, we are the best. But we're not going to be the best for long if it keeps going like it is right now. Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. I'll get it settled very fast. [applause] I don't want you guys going over there. I don't want you going over there. And I'm the only candidate in this race who can make this promise. I will prevent—this is for the spouses. I will prevent World War III. Nobody else is going to prevent it. You're going to end up in World War III. Look at what's going on right now with Ukraine. Their surging into Russia. Okay? You're going to end up in World War III and it's going to be a bad one. When I'm President, America will be respected again, respected like never before. They were respected four years ago. Viktor Orban from Hungary, Prime Minister, he's known as a very tough leader, tough man, good man, but a tough man, but one of the toughest in Europe. And they asked him a little while ago, why is it that the whole world is blowing up? He says, ""because President Trump isn't the President of the United States. If he were the President of the United States, none of this stuff would be happening right now. None of it. None of it at all."" And I believe that's true. That's true. For that to have happened is crazy. I'll take immediate action to restore our depleted military. You know we don't have any ammunition again. Do you remember when I first came in? They said, ""sir,"" right? [Trump points at crowd member] I see that guy. Sounds like you were pretty much involved with trying to fill it up. I like that guy. I don't know who the hell he is. Stand up. Let me see. Stand up. He's like central casting, but that's—come on, stand up right there. That's good. I like that guy. [applause] It's true, though. True. We had no ammunition. I took over. They came to me, ""sir."" ""How are we doing militarily?"" ""We have a problem, sir."" ""What is it?"" ""We have no ammunition."" That's a lousy thing. You know, you're running a country, we got enemies, and if you have the smart President, you'll be able to do fine, but you don't want to tell your enemy you have no—I don't want to tell President Xi of China we don't have ammunition. But before that, they came out with a report, before I got there, saying that the United States has no ammunition. I said, ""Who would release a report like this?"" Even if it's true, you don't talk about it, right? We do a lot of reports that are stupid reports, like a report that came out a couple of ","weeks ago that we would lose in a war with China. You saw that report? We're not going to lose in a war with China. That we would lose in a war with China, how stupid are these people that would put a report like that? If you feel we're a little weak, you gotta strengthen it up, but you don't do reports that we're going to lose to China in a war. Stupid people do that, like the people that are in office right now. [applause] I had, and you will say it, I had ammunition. We had so much, it was coming out of our gills, right? I had ammunition I said, ""what the hell do we do with all this ammunition?"" We had so much. And now we don't have ammunition again. We gave it all away to different groups, but mostly into Ukraine, and we don't have ammunition. We had so many missiles, we didn't know if we could fire them all. We had to hire teams of people. Even the concept, we had so much. Warehouses were full. We took new warehouses and now we're back to a point where we have no ammunition again. These people are just so destructive. So I always look for good words, highly sophisticated, and I'm highly educated, I like sophisticated words, but there's only one word I can—stupid. They're stupid people. I'd like to say, I guess you could say incompetent sounds maybe a little better. I don't know which is better, being stupid or being incompetent because they're both. [laughter] We have no ammunition again, but we'll get it taken care of. Boy, oh boy, can you imagine if they wanted to go after us? Can you imagine that? And we're saying they have no ammunition. This was just released a little while ago. We give so much of it away. We never get anything for it either. Europe, by the way, is much more, and should be much more, concerned, obviously, with the Ukraine situation than us, but we've spent $150 billion more. Why do we spend 150 billion? Why aren't they going to equalize? They should equalize. I told them, I said, ""you gotta equalize it."" They don't like—then I read Barack Obama is much more popular than Donald Trump. Of course he is. He said, ""we'll spend all the money."" I say, ""you gotta pay up."" And that's what happened. I got NATO to pay up hundreds of billions of dollars, but then now we've lost it again because nobody's—I'll bet you nobody's ever asked Europe to pay up. They don't even ask. I'll bet you that nobody said to Europe, ""we're 150 billion more than you."" They have about the same size economy when you add all of the different nations up as us, and nobody has said to them, ""gotta pay up."" I did that. I was with NATO. They were way behind. Of the 28 nations, almost all of them were not paid. Other than that, they were doing quite nicely. Thank you. But we had seven that were paid and the rest weren't. And Obama came in, made a speech, Bush came in, made a speech. I came in and said, ""you guys owe us a lot of money"" because we were spending our money. So think of it. They take advantage of us on trade because they are horrible to us on trade, the European nations. Horrible. They don't take our farm products. When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in the middle of Germany? Maybe never. I said to Angela, ""Angela, do you have any Chevrolet's or Fords in the middle of Munich?"" ""No, I don't think so."" But we have plenty of Mercedes Benz's and BMW's, Volkswagen's. Millions and millions of cars. So they get us in the military, then they get us on trade. On top of everything else. It's not a good way. I was straightening it all out. It was getting straightened out very quickly. And very interesting, though, I said, ""who would do this? Who would do this?"" Hundreds of billions of dollars we lose in the defense of Europe. All I say is, ""let's equalize. We'll help you, but you owe us 150 billion."" And during one meeting, I remember, NATO, one of the heads of countries, I won't embarrass him by saying which one, but we had 28 countries gathered round the table, it was sort of a semi-secret meeting, which nothing secret in this world, but some of the press didn't want to report it because it was a good story. But one of the leaders stood up, said, ""does that mean—"" He wasn't paid. He owed us billions. ""Does that mean if we don't pay you, you're not going to defend us against Russia?"" I said, ""that's what it means. Are you saying you're delinquent?"" I don't know about that word. That's a real estate word. Very simple word. It means you're not paid. ""You're saying you're delinquent."" ""Yes, let's say we're delinquent. Will you defend us?"" I said, "" absolutely not."" I took so much heat from the fake news media. Now, if I said, ""yes, I will defend you,"" they're not going to pay. What happened is hundreds of billions of dollars came pouring in because I said that. [applause] Hundreds of billions of dollars came pouring in and they have money, but this should not be happening. This should not. This mess that's going on over there now is very dangerous and it shouldn't be happening. I'm the one that got them the money. Literally hundreds of billions of dollars came right in. Guys that were not paying for years. But other Presidents never even asked them for the money. They'd make a speech and leave. Literally, I was getting ready to make a speech. I said, ""let me see some statements."" I looked at some, I said, ""nobody's paying."" We paid for everybody. We were keeping it solvent. One of my proudest achievements on my first term was to create Space Force, the first new branch of the armed forces in over 70 years. That's a big deal. Now that Space Force is up and running, I agree with your leadership, you want this very badly, but I agree that the time has come to create a Space National Guard as the primary combat reserve of the US Space Force. [cheers and applause] Very good. Very good. Thank you. Thank you. So as President, I will sign historic legislation creating a Space National Guard, until I spoke to somebody that's a great guy, very much a fan of yours, Marco Rubio. I said, ""what do you think?"" He said, ""I love this. I love it. I love it."" So we're going to do that. Space Force has been very important. Very, very important. When I did that, other people came in, they wanted to end it, and they were just hammered because people realized how important—we were getting just destroyed in space. And now we're leading. We are leading with all of the major metrics in space. Russia and China were killing us because we didn't really have a focus on it. And once you did that, we have a focus, and now we're leading in space. Throughout the Armed Forces, we will make a historic investment in building a US military for the 21st century, investing heavily in drones, robotics, artificial intelligence. Hypersonics. You know hypersonics was us. Somebody stole the stuff and Russia ended up making them, but we're making them now. But Russia ended up making that, super speed missiles. They go about seven times faster than a regular missile, which is quite fast. And uh we're going to build a great Iron Dome for missile defense around our nation. Other countries has it. Israel has it. Ronald Reagan wanted this many years ago, but we didn't have the technology at that point. But now we have the technology, so we're going to do the Great Iron Dome, and it's all going to be built in our country. We're going to build it right here. [cheers and applause] And as your Commander-in-Chief, I will ensure that the National Guard members have access to train on the same state-of-the-art equipment as active duty forces. We're going to make sure about that. [applause] And I'll also get you reinforcement for allies abroad, making them pull their weight. They have to do that and they have to pay their fair share, as I was saying. And for years, all of these NATO countries spent far less than 2% of GDP on their militaries, leaving our forces overstretched. We were the ones making up the difference in paying for, to make up for shortfalls and help deter threats. I'll insist that every NATO nation must spend at least 3%. You have to go up to 3%. 2% is the steal of the century, especially when we're paying for it. You know, we pay for them. It's just not even believable. For most NATO countries, this will represent a defense budget increase of about 30%. And of course, if you take a look at their numbers, their numbers are starting to dwindle because of all the money they're spending in Ukraine. Starting on day one, I will confront the recruiting, retention, and moral—when you talk about the crisis that you have, you have a morale crisis because I think it's a country crisis. I think morale is about the leader of the country. I really do. I think you can only do so much. They have to be proud of our—their leader. They have to be proud of their country. They have to believe in their country. They have to believe in the American dream, or you're going to have a morale problem. And that's what you have. You have a morale problem. We will get critical race theory and left-wing gender insanity out of the armed forces and totally out of the United States military,—[applause] and we'll take care of our amazing veterans better than anybody. In my first term, I gave the VA Choice and made it permanent. VA Choice, where you don't have a doctor. You go outside. I mean people were waiting for four months, for five months. You people probably know it. You have friends that know it very well. They go in for something that was not a big deal, and they end up being terminally ill cause they couldn't get to see a doctor, so I created and have VA Choice. They've been wanting to do it for 57 years. I got it done. Passed in Congress.[applause] And as you know, they now go in, if they can't get rapid service, we call it Rapid Service, then they go to an outside doctor, they get themselves fixed up, and we pay the bill and it's been great. It's been great. But I understand that Biden wants to terminate it. He wants to go back to the old system where you wait for nine months and then you die. It's not even believable. No, they want to terminate it. Now, after this speech, they won't. Every time I come in and say what really bad things, they end up—like I said, no tax on tips. It caught on like crazy. No tax on tips. This doesn't affect you guys. You're not big for tips, okay? [laughter] You don't need tips. But there are a lot of people that no tax on tips is a big deal. And I said, no tax on tips. I want two, three months. All of a sudden she's making a speech, and they were just the opposite, they were going after tip income, which is pretty hard to go after in all fairness. And she's making a speech. It goes, ""oh, and by the way, no tax on tips."" And it didn't play well for her. But they do that now on VA Choice. You watch what's going to happen. They'll end up saying, ""oh, we want to keep VA Choice."" But they don't. They're not competent and they don't—but VA Choice has been one of the great and the others, VA Accountability. Do you know what that is? VA Accountability. The veterans had some horrible, horrible people in there. Sadists, bad people. They treated our veterans very badly because they weren't in primetime. In primetime, they wouldn't have talked to them that way, but they weren't in primetime and they were sadists and a lot of other things. Thousands. 9,000 of them. And it was a shocking act of betrayal. It uh, we had to fire, we fired 9,000 people that were bad and we replaced them with good people. And then Kamala and Biden gutted those reforms after they got in, and they tried to reinstate many of the people that were fired for good reason, because they weren't treating our veterans. They were sadists, in many cases, vicious people. And then they gave them the option to come back or get a massive $200 million buyout. Can you believe this? Of people that treated our veterans badly? And I had the highest number, 92% approval, from our veterans. That's the highest number by far ever. Now it's in the 40s, and it didn't take long to get there, but we had 92% approval rate from our veterans. Upon my inauguration, we will take the sadists that Kamala Harris let in and escort them from the VA hospitals and get them the hell out of our federal buildings and away from our great men and women. [applause] Because those who mistreat our veterans will not be protected. They will be terminated. We're going to terminate them. We're going to get them out. Can't believe we have to do it. It's like I have to say it a second time. Under Kamala Harris, American veterans are treated worse, by far, than illegal aliens. Illegal aliens are treated—you ever see them? They stay in hotels. We have veterans sleeping on the street and inside luxury hotels, you have people that came into our country, many from prisons, many from mental institutions, many terrorists, and they are treated better than our veterans. They don't care about our veterans. As borders are, Kamala has spent over one billion of taxpayer money to house illegal aliens and foreign migrants in some of the most expensive housing and hotels anywhere in the country. Meanwhile, more than 41,000 homeless American veterans are living in squalor on our streets. I mean I hope people are going to remember this because it's terrible. What's going on is terrible. You know, we become the Republican—I call it the party of common sense. We want to have strong borders. We want have fair elections. Like it'd be nice if somebody votes and the vote actually counts. Little things like that. But we gotta have borders. We can't let millions of people come into a country. I called it invasion. I got the wall built by using military funds. I said, ""our country's being invaded,"" and I was able to do—we won 11 lawsuits. Everybody sued me. Crazy Nancy Pelosi sued me. She was always—she's crazy as a bed bug, that one. She's nuts. She's a nut. But at least Joe Biden likes her a lot. No, I don't think so. Think he's angry? He fights for a year and a half in a primary system. He ends up getting 14 million votes, and they have somebody that didn't get one vote. She was let out sooner than anybody. She never made Iowa the first state. Never made it. She was the first one out of 22 people to quit, and she's now the nominee of the party. I mean, explain this, please. When I take office, I will sign an executive order to stop every penny that Harris has been spending on the shelter and transport of illegal aliens, and we will redirect that money to provide shelter and treatment for homeless American veterans. [cheers and applause] And we will end very rapidly veterans homelessness in America. We had it down to a level that was the lowest In a long time. We would've had it knocked out, but we were interrupted. As you know, Kamala's border Invasion has directly impacted thousands of National Guard families. I'll tell you what, African American families, Hispanic American families, their jobs are being taken. Unrelated to you, but their jobs are being taken. What's happening at our border, and she's in charge, and now she said, ""Well, I wasn't really involved too much with the border. I wasn't involved."" And even better now, she's saying, ""Oh, well, we actually had strong borders."" If they say it enough, even though we had probably 20 million people, more than 20 million people, but they figure if you say it over and over again, ""Our borders were strong, our borders were strong."" And these are people, they're not into it. Maybe like us, maybe like me, certainly. Nobody's into it like me. I had a nice life until I did this. You know that? I had a nice, very beautiful life, but I wouldn't change it. They said, ""Would you have done it again?"" I said, ""Absolutely, because we're going to make America great again."" We already did, and we're going to do it again. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Last Thanksgiving. I visited the southern border near McAllen, Texas, where patriots of the Texas National Guard were doing the job that Harris refused to do. She refused to do it. In fact, when our guardsmen put up razor wire and boys to stop illegal crossings, Kamala and Joe Biden, Crooked Joe, sued to take those defenses down. You know that, right? How about where they say, ""No, no, we have a strong border."" So bad. But then we find out that they flew almost a million people in over the border. They flew. That stops all of their—I shouldn't say this because if there's a debate, it would be nice to surprise it with that one. They flew. They have to have an answer to everything. ""Well, we decided, look, they flew almost a million people into our country. Our country can't handle it. No country can handle it. Our country's going to go bankrupt. No country can handle it. They're taken over the schools, they're taken over the hospitals, they're taken over everything, and they're getting jobs that were taken by other people that are not too happy. But think of it, they flew almost a million people over everything because they were saying about how strong the border, but then they say, ""Well, what about the million people you flew?"" They have no answer for that one yet, but they'll come up with one. They always have an answer. I want to salute every Guard member who has deployed as part of Operation Lone Star to defend America from her migrant invasion, it's what it is. Including those from Texas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, or as they say, Missoura[sic]. I love Missoura. I love that state. They do say it that way. Never quite understood that, but I say it that way because I won by 25 points, so I say it that way. [applause] It's true. Utah, Tennessee, Montana, Nebraska, Indiana and New Hampshire, every one of them. [applause] I want to thank them all. Thank them all.[applause] And do not lose hope because a few months from now, you're once again going to have a commander in chief who defends the sovereign borders of the United States above all else, we have to. Together we'll stop the human traffickers, which are horrible. They traffic in women, mostly and children, but women, mostly, and because of the internet, it's a big business. It's big business. It's going to be bigger than the drug business, they think. The internet has caused a problem. You think of it almost as an ancient crime. Human trafficking, who would imagine? But because of the internet, it's a big business and we had it down to the smallest number in 42 years, and now they come along and it's going at a level. They stuff women into the back of cars and they stuff them into trunks and bring them around and make a lot of money, and we allow it to happen. We'll defeat the child smugglers. We'll crush the cartels, and on day one, I will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have to get the criminals from jails. They're releasing their prisoners into our country. They're releasing their guard. You gotta see MS-13, the worst gangs in the world, MS-13, they're collecting them and dropping them into the United States. I moved out thousands and thousands of them. They're moving them into the United States. They're coming back. They're taking their drug dealers, their criminals, their murderers. In Venezuela, crime is down 72% because they've gotten their gang members, they're dropping them all into our country, many countries. And I'm not just talking about South America. All over the world, they're dropping their criminals into our country. They're emptying their jails and they're emptying their prisons into our country. I mean, how stupid can we be? What are we doing? And we're going to have a crime wave, the likes of which you haven't seen. You see it every day now where a person from such-and-such a country is violent at levels that nobody's ever seen before. You don't have to hear it, but at levels that nobody's ever seen before. But what it is doing is it's making these countries, and I'm not blaming them, if you can get away with it. I'd be doing it. If I were the president of such-and, I would've done better than them. My prisons would be totally empty. They're emptying their prisons. They're taking their worst people. They're taking their real murderers, drug dealers. They're dropping them. They're taking them and busing them into the United States and dropping them, and they're saying, ""If you come back, we're going to kill you."" And these people aren't worried about being killed. They're tough. This is a tough group of people and we've got them, and nothing good is going to come out of that, and that includes a lot of terrorists. Your choice in this election is between a president who will always have your back and a radical liberal who will never, ever, ever have your back, whether you like it or not. In 2020, when the left-wing mobs came from all over to burn our cities to the ground, Kamala stood with the looters and rioters and raised money to bail out violent criminals all over the jails of Minnesota. She came with money to bail them out. Kamala's running mate, his nickname is Tampon Tim, but I wouldn't say that because this group is a little more low-key than the ones I'm used to speaking before. [laughter] Tampon Tim Walz, he wants—think of this. He signed a bill mandating that every boy's bathroom has tampons in it. I don't think that's good. It's not good. He ignored the pleas of the mayor and the police chief to deploy the National Guard in Minneapolis and said, ""You're not highly trained soldiers. You're 19-year-olds who cook."" That's what he said, ""You're 19-year-olds who cook."" That's a pretty famous statement. As president, I stood with the National Guard as you saved Minneapolis, saved Kenosha and saved Washington DC. I saved them. If I didn't override what they wanted to do and what tradition is, those places would've been—we would've lost every monument in Washington. They came into Washington and they were very rambunctious. They liked to pull the statues down, some of these beautiful statues, and then they hit Abraham Lincoln. I said, ""All right, that's the end of that."" And I found there was a bill from the early 1900s, we don't do bills like that anymore, they said, ""If you touch government property, statues, monuments of any kind, you'll serve 10 years with no probation, no early getting out. You go to jail for 10 years."" Very simple. It was beautifully stated. It was like one paragraph and it had dust on it, it was dusty. Nobody used it because we wouldn't do that because we become very soft. They only go after political opponents. They don't do anything like—murderers, those guys are safe. Drug dealers, no problem. But political opponents they go after. So this was in very bad. It was a very old bill and I had a news conference and they were all over it. They wanted to take down the Thomas Jefferson, the Jefferson Memorial. They wanted to take it down. They were heading that way. They were actually heading that way. We had them all stopped, but they were heading that way. It's like fighting a war. And I went out to a news conference. They announced, ""Anybody that touches any of our monuments or statues goes to jail for 10 years."" Everybody left Washington DC. I was very lonely. They all left. I watched them. I watched their asses from the back. [laughter] That's all I could see is thousands of asses. And that stopped. We got it stopped. We got it stopped quickly. They all left immediately, and they haven't come back. Although, the other day you see them starting to do it again. They're taking the spray paint and they're spraying those gorgeous limestone tigers and all the different things. When you spray limestone, you'll see it in 100 years from now because it's a very porous stone, and they were spraying the hell out of it, and they were burning the American flag. I want to get a law passed. Everyone tells me, ""Oh, sir, it's very hard."" You burn an American flag, you go to jail for one year. Gotta do it. [applause] We gotta do it. They say it's not constitutional. They say, ""Sir, that's not constitutional."" We'll make it constitutional. We're going to make it constitutional, but you burn an American flag, you go to jail for one year. That was terrible, what happened at the convention in Chicago. They're burning American flags all over the place and the fake news doesn't want to show it. I will proudly stand with you in defense of law and order, and we're going to have four great years in the White House. We're going to make our country very special again. I know your commitment. I know your character in conclusion, and I know your courage. As president, I saw it every year during natural disaster, national emergency, and just a few weeks ago, we saw it in the moments after an evil assassin tried to take my life. That sucker was moving fast. I say, ""Wow, glad I got down quick, quickly."" But it was uh quite a time. It was quite a thing. Who would think? But that day, a member of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard was in the second row watching as the bullets flew when the shots rang out and hit a great patriot, Cory. We know now Cory by his first name, Cory, the Pennsylvania Guardsman, did not shy away. He did not run for cover. He ran toward the gunshots, took off his tie to use as a tourniquet and cradled Cory's head in his hands, and it was a tough scene. Cory died, as you know. Two other people were hit very badly, were supposed to die, and the doctors up there did a phenomenal job. They're living and they're doing okay, and although he tragically could not revive Cory, he did what every Guardsman here would have done, and it was a tough, it was a tough thing he did, to be honest, I saw that. It was a tough thing he did. Tremendous courage. Not only the bullets, I mean, just the fact he was holding this guy who really got hit. He really got hit, but he gave his all and he was very proud to do it. America's blessed to have such extraordinary patriots, as are all of the people in this room. You put your service above yourself, and when our country needs you, you always answer the call. I know that very much. I know the people here. That's the spirit of duty and loyalty that defines the men and women of the National Guard, and it's the spirit that is going to save our country because our country needs saving. With your support in this election, we will reclaim our sovereignty. We will rebuild our military. We will support our police. We will stop migrant crime, which is at levels that nobody can even imagine. We will restore our economy. We'll get rid of inflation. We will protect our second amendment. We will lift up our cities, we will secure our rights, and we will defend our freedoms like we have never defended our freedoms before and we will fight, fight, fight for America. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So just in closing, you've never let me down, never. You've always been there for me when we had emergencies, when we had a crisis, and I'm going to always be there for you and I can promise you this, together we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you all. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much. God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you, man. Thank you. [music: Village People, YMCA.]","",""

The Vice President: California. [Laughs.] [Applause.] Good evening, everyone. Good evening. [Laughs.] [Applause.] Good evening. [Laughs.] [Applause.] Oh, my goodness. [Applause.] Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Go- — [laughs]. [Applause.] Good evening. Thank you. [Applause.] Thank you. Thank you. [Applause.] Audience: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!

[Applause.] Audience: USA! USA! USA! The Vice President: Thank you all. Audience: USA! USA! USA! The Vice President: Thank you all. [Applause.] Okay, we've got to get to some business. We've got to get to some business. Okay. Thank you all. [Applause.] Okay. [Laughs.] Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. [Applause.] Thank you, thank you. Please. Thank you. [Applause.] Please. Thank you so very much. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. [Applause.] Okay, let's get to business. Let's get to business. All right. [Laughs.] [Applause.] So, let me start by thanking my most incredible husband, Doug — [applause] — for being an incredible partner to me, an incredible father to Cole and Ella. And happy anniversary, Dougie. [Laughs.] [Applause.] I love you so very much. To our president, Joe Biden — [applause] — when I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude. Your record is extraordinary, as history will show, and your character is inspiring. And Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you both. [Applause.] And to Coach Tim Walz — [applause] — you are going to be an incredible vice president. [Applause.] And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign, your support is humbling. So, America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected, but I'm no stranger to unlikely journeys. So, my mother, our mother, Shyamala Harris, had one of her own. And I miss her every day and especially right now. And I know she's looking down smiling. [Applause.] I know that. So, my mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer. [Applause.] When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage, but as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. [Applause.] They — they fell in love and got married, and that act of self-determination made my sister Maya and me. [Applause.] Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck packed with all our belongings, ready to go to Illinois; to Wisconsin — [applause]; and wherever our parents' jobs took us. My early memories of our parents together are very joyful ones: a home filled with laughter and music — Aretha, Coltrane, and Miles. At the park, my mother would say, ""Stay close."" But my father would say, as he smiled, ""Run, Kamala, run. Don't be afraid. Don't let anything stop you."" [Applause.] From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless. But the harmony between my parents did not last. When I was in elementary school, they split up, and it was mostly my mother who raised us. Before she could finally afford to buy a home, she rented a small apartment in the East Bay. In the bay — [applause] — in the Bay, you either live in the Hills or the Flatlands. We lived in the Flats, a beautiful working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers — [applause] — all who tended their lawns with pride. My mother, she worked long hours. And like many working parents, she leaned on a trusted circle to help raise us: Mrs. Shelton, who ran the daycare below us and became a second mother; Uncle Sherman; Aunt Mary; Uncle Freddy; Auntie Kris. None of them family by blood and all of them family by love. [Applause.] Family who taught us how to make gumbo, how to play chess — and sometimes even let us win. Family who loved us, believed in us, and told us we could be anything and do anything. [Applause.] They instilled in us the values they personified: community, faith, and the importance of treating others as you would want to be treated — with kindness, respect, and compassion. [Applause.] My mother was a brilliant, five-foot-tall brown woman with an accent. [Applause.] And as the eldest child — as the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her. But my mother never lost her cool. She was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for women's health. And she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night. She taught us to never complain about injustice, but do something about it. Do something about it. [Applause.] That was my mother. And she taught us — and she always — she also taught us — and she also taught us ""and never do anything half-assed."" [Applause.] And that is a direct quote — [laughs] — a direct quote. I grew up immersed in the ideals of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents had met at a civil rights gathering. And they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers, like Thurgood Marshall and C- — Constance Baker Motley — those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America. So, at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work. I wanted to be a lawyer. And when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life. You see, when I was in high school, I started to notice something about my best friend, Wanda. She was sad at school, and there were times she didn't want to go home. So, one day, I asked if everything was all right, and she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us, and she did. [Applause.] This is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor — to protect people like Wanda — because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity, and to justice. [Applause.] As a prosecutor, when I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim but in the name of the people for a simple reason: In our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. [Applause.] And I would often explain this to console survivors of crime, to remind them no one should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. [Applause.] And every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I said five words: ""Kamala Harris, for the people."" [Applause.] And to be clear — and to be clear, my entire career, I've only had one client: the people. [Applause.] And so, on behalf of the people; on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks; on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey; on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with — people who work hard, chase their dreams, and look out for one another; on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America. [Applause.] And with this election — and — [laughs] — and with this election, our nation — our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past; a chance to chart a new way forward — [applause] — not — not as members of any one party or faction but as Americans. [Applause.] And let me say, I know there are people of various political views watching tonight, and I want you to know I promise to be a president for all Americans. [Applause.] You can always trust me to put country above party and self; to hold sacred America's fundamental principles, from the rule of law to free and fair elections to the peaceful transfer of power. [Applause.] I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens; who is realistic, practical, and has common sense; and always fights for the American people. [Applause.] From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my life's work. [Applause.] As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California — [applause] — I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks — [applause] — delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation. [Applause.] I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges — [applause] — for workers who were being cheated out of their wages, the wages they were due — [applause] — for seniors facing elder abuse. I fought against the cartels who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings — [applause] — who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities. And I will tell you, these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices. We were underestimated at practically every turn, but we never gave up, because the future is always worth fighting for. [Applause.] And that's the fight we are in right now: a fight for America's future. [Applause.] Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important of our lives, it is one of the most important in the life of our nation. [Applause.] In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. [Laughter.] But the consequences — but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. [Applause.] Consider — consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election. Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite. He fanned the flames. And now, for an entirely different set of crimes, he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans — [applause] — and separately — and separately found liable for committing sexual abuse. And consider — consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol; his explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents, and anyone he sees as the enemy; his explicit intent to deploy our active-duty military against our own citizens. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Consider — consider the power he will have, especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States not to improve your life, not to strengthen our national security, but to serve the only client he has ever had: himself. [Applause.] And we know — and we know what a second Trump term would look like. It's all laid out in Project 2025, written by his closest advisers. And its sum total is to pull our country back to the past. But, America -- Audience: We are not going back! The Vice President: — we are not going back. [Applause.] We are not going back. We are not going back. Audience: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! The Vice President: We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. We are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools. [Applause.] We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and childcare for our children. [Applause.] America, we are not going back. Audience: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! The Vice President: And we are charting — and we are charting a new way forward — [applause] — forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class, because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to America's success. And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. [Applause.] And I'll tell you, this is personal for me. The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means, yet we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them, because, as she taught us, opportunity is not available to everyone. That's why we will create what I call an opportunity economy — an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed — [applause] — whether you live in a rural area, small town, or big city. And as president, I will bring together labor and workers — [applause] — and small-business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, to grow our economy, and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries. We will provide access to capital for small-business owners and entrepreneurs and founders. [Applause.] And we will end America's housing shortage — [applause] — and protect Social Security and Medicare. [Applause.] Now compare that to Donald Trump, because I think everyone here knows he doesn't actually fight for the middle class. Not — he doesn't actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add -- Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: — up to $5 trillion to the national debt. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And all the while, he intends to enact what in effect is a national sales tax — call it a ""Trump tax"" — that would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, instead of a Trump tax hike, we will pass a middle-class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. [Applause.] Friends, I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home. [Applause.] But tonight, in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. And let's be clear about how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And now he brags about it. In his words, quote, ""I did it, and I'm proud to have done it."" End quote. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, I'll tell you, over the past two years, I've traveled across our country, and women have told me their stories. Husbands and fathers have shared theirs. Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot, developing sepsis, losing the ability to ever again have children, all because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients. Couples just trying to grow their family, cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. Children who have survived sexual assault potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term. This is what's happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done. As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion, and enact a nationwide abortion ban, with or without Congress. Audience: Booo -- And get this. Get this. He plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Simply put, they are out of their minds. [Applause.] And one must ask — one must ask: Why exactly is it that they don't trust women? Well, we trust women. We trust women. [Applause.] And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. [Applause.] In this election, many other fundamental freedoms are at stake: the freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities, and places of worship; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride — [applause]; the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis — [applause]; and the freedom that unlocks all the others, the freedom to vote. [Applause.] With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. [Applause.] And let me be clear. And let me be clear. After decades in law enforcement, I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border. Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The Border Patrol endorsed it. But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, I refuse to play politics with our security, and here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law. [Applause.] I know — I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system. [Applause.] We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border. [Applause.] And, America, we must also be steadfast in advancing our security and values abroad. As vice president, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, strengthened our alliances, and engaged with our brave troops overseas. [Applause.] As commander in chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. [Applause.] And I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families, and I will always honor and never disparage their service and their sacrifice. [Applause.] Audience: USA! USA! USA! The Vice President: I will make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and artificial intelligence; that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century; and that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership. Trump, on the other hand, threatened to abandon NATO. He encouraged Putin to invade our allies. Said Russia could, quote, ""do whatever the hell they want."" Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelenskyy to warn him about Russia's plan to invade. I helped mobilize a global response — over 50 countries — to defend against Putin's aggression. [Applause.] And as president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO Allies. [Applause.] With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock, because now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. [Applause.] And let me be clear. And let me be clear. I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself — [applause] — and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7 — [applause] — including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival. At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. [Applause.] Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination. [Applause.] And know this: I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists. I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un, who are rooting for Trump — who are rooting for Trump. [Applause.] Because, you know, they know — they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump won't hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself. [Applause.] And as president, I will never waver in defense of America's security and ideals, because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs. [Applause.] Audience: USA! USA! USA! The Vice President: So, fellow Americans — fellow Americans, I — I love our country with all my heart. [Applause.] Everywhere I go — everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation that is ready to move forward, ready for the next step in the incredible journey that is America. I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation and inspired the world — that here, in this country, anything is possible; that nothing is out of reach. An America where we care for one another, look out for one another, and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us. [Applause.] That none of us — none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed. [Applause.] And that in unity, there is strength. You know, our opponents in this race are out there every day denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is. Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are; you show them who you are. [Applause.] America, let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for: freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness, and endless possibilities. [Applause.] We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world. And on behalf of our children and our grandchildren and all those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy of this moment. It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done, guided by optimism and faith: to fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish, and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth — the privilege and pride of being an American.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373852",9552,"Wow. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Thank you. Thank you, first of all, to Vice President Harris. Thanks for putting your trust in me, and for inviting me to be part of this incredible campaign. And a thank you to President Joe Biden, for four years of strong, historic leadership. It's the honor of my life to accept your nomination for vice president of the United States. We're all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason: We love this country. So thank you, to all of you here in Chicago, and all of you watching at home tonight. Thank you for your passion. Thank you for your determination. And most of all, thank you for bringing the joy to this fight. Now I grew up in Butte, Nebraska, a town of 400 people. I had 24 kids in my high school class. And none of them went to Yale. But I'll tell you what. Growing up in a small town like that, you learn how to take care of each other. That family down the road, they may not think like you do, they may not pray like you do. They may not love like you do. But they're your neighbors. And you look out for them. And they look out for you. Everybody belongs. And everybody has a responsibility to contribute. For me, it was serving in the Army National Guard. I joined up two days after my 17th birthday, and I proudly wore our nation's uniform for 24 years. My dad, a Korean War-era Army veteran, died of lung cancer a couple of years later. He left behind a mountain of medical debt. Thank god for Social Security survivor benefits. And thank God for the G.I. Bill that allowed my dad and me to go to college. And millions of other Americans. Eventually, like the rest of my family, I fell in love with teaching. Three out of four of us married teachers. I wound up teaching social studies and coaching football at Mankato West High School. Go, Scarlets. We ran — we ran a 44 defense, we played through to the whistle on every single play, and we even won a state championship. Never close the yearbook, people. But it was those players and my students who inspired me to run for Congress. They saw in me what I had hoped to instill in them: a commitment to the common good, an understanding that we're all in this together, and the belief that a single person can make a real difference for their neighbors. So there I was, a 40-something high school teacher with little kids, zero political experience and no money, running in a deep-red district. But you know what? Never underestimate a public-school teacher. Never. I represented my neighbors in Congress for 12 years. And I learned an awful lot. I learned how to work across the aisle on issues like growing the rural economies and taking care of veterans. And I learned how to compromise without compromising my values. Then I came back to serve as governor, and we got right to work making a difference in our neighbors' lives. We cut taxes for the middle class. We passed paid family and medical leave. We invested in fighting crime and affordable housing. We cut the cost of prescription drugs and helped people escape the kind of medical debt that nearly sank my family. And we made sure that every kid in our state gets breakfast and lunch every day. So while other states were banning books from their schools, we were banishing hunger from ours. We also protected reproductive freedom, because in Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make. And even if we wouldn't make those same choices for ourselves, we've got a golden rule: Mind your own damn business. And that includes I.V.F. and fertility treatments. And this is personal for Gwen and I. If you've never experienced the hell that is infertility, I guarantee you, you know somebody who has. I can remember praying each night for a phone call. The pit in your stomach when the phone would ring, and the absolute agony when we heard the treatments hadn't worked. It took Gwen and I years, but we had access to fertility treatments. And when our daughter was born, we named her Hope. Hope, Gus and Gwen, you are my entire world, and I love you. I'm letting you in on how we started a family because this is a big part about what this election is about. Freedom. When Republicans use the word freedom, they mean that the government should be free to invade your doctor's office. Corporations — free to pollute your air and water. And banks — free to take advantage of customers. But when we Democrats talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make a better life for yourself and the people that you love. Freedom to make your own health care decisions. And yeah, your kids' freedom to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in the hall. Look, I know guns. I'm a veteran. I'm a hunter. And I was a better shot than most Republicans in Congress, and I've got the trophies to prove it. But I'm also a dad. I believe in the Second Amendment, but I also believe our first responsibility is to keep our kids safe. That's what this is all about. The responsibility we have to our kids, to each other and to the future that we're building together, in which everyone is free to build the kind of life they want. But not everyone has that same sense of responsibility. Some folks just don't understand what it takes to be a good neighbor. Take Donald Trump and JD Vance. Their Project 2025 will make things much, much harder for people who are just trying to live their lives. They spend a lot of time pretending they know nothing about this. But look, I coached high school football long enough to know, and trust me on this: When somebody takes the time to draw up a playbook, they're going to use it. And we know, if these guys get back in the White House, they'll start jacking up the costs on the middle class. They'll repeal the Affordable Care Act. They'll gut Social Security and Medicare. And they will ban abortion across this country, with or without Congress. Here's the thing. It's an agenda nobody asked for. It's an agenda that serves nobody, except the richest and the most extreme amongst us. And it's an agenda that does nothing for our neighbors in need. Is it weird? Absolutely. Absolutely. But it's also wrong, and it's dangerous. It's not just me saying so, it's Trump's own people. They were with him for four years. They're warning us that the next four years will be much, much worse. You know, when I was teaching, every year we'd elect a student body president. And you know what? Those teenagers could teach Donald Trump a hell of a lot about what a leader is. Leaders don't spend all day insulting people and blaming others. Leaders do the work. So I don't know about you, I'm ready to turn the page on these guys. So, go ahead. Say it with me: We're not going back. [Crowd chants: ""We're not going back.""] We've got something better to offer the American people. It starts with our candidate, Kamala Harris. From her first day — as a prosecutor, as a district attorney, as an attorney general, as a United States senator, and then our vice president — she's fought on the side of the American people. She's taken on the predators and fraudsters. She's taken down the transnational gangs. And she's stood up to powerful corporate interests. She has never hesitated to reach across that aisle if it meant improving your lives. And she's always done it with energy, with passion and with joy. Folks, we've got a chance to make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States. But I think we owe it to the American people to tell them exactly what she'd do as president before we ask them for their votes. So this is the part — clip and save it, and send it to your undecided relatives so they know: If you're a middle-class family, or trying to get into the middle class, Kamala Harris is going to cut your taxes. If you're getting squeezed by prescription drug prices, Kamala Harris is going to take on Big Pharma. If you're hoping to buy a home, Kamala Harris is going to help make it more affordable. And no matter who you are, Kamala Harris is going to stand up and fight for your freedom to live the life that you want to lead, because that's what we want for ourselves, and it's what we want for our neighbors. You know, you might not know it, but I haven't given a lot of big speeches like this. But I have given a lot of pep talks. So let me finish with this, team. It's the fourth quarter. We're down a field goal. But we're on offense and we've got the ball. We're driving down the field. And boy, do we have the right team. Kamala Harris is tough. Kamala Harris is experienced. And Kamala Harris is ready. Our job, our job, our job, our job for everyone watching, is to get in the trenches and do the blocking and tackling. One inch at a time. One yard at a time. One phone call at a time. One door knock at a time. One $5 donation at a time. Look, we've got 76 days. That's nothing. There'll be time to sleep when you're dead. We're going to leave it on the field. That's how we'll keep moving forward. That's how we'll turn the page on Donald Trump. That's how we'll build a country where workers come first, health care and housing are human rights, and the government stays the hell out of your bedroom. That's how we make America a place where no child is left hungry. Where no community is left behind. Where nobody gets told they don't belong. That's how we're going to fight. And as the next president of the United States always says, when we fight — [Crowd chants: ""We win!""] When we fight — [Crowd chants: ""We win!""] When we fight — [Crowd chants: ""We win!""] Thank you. God bless.","","",""

Trump. [cheers and applause] TRUMP: Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Nice place by the way. Incredible people outside. You saw the crowds, it was just incredible. [cheers] And we really feel good about the state and the area. We're doing very well here. Just got a poll that was very good. Got a lot of good polls the last couple of days. Thank you to the Livingston County Sheriff's Department for welcoming us in such a beautiful way. This was a beautiful welcome, and these are great people. [cheers and applause] These are great people. And we have, in terms of law enforcement, just about every law enforcement group in the country has endorsed us, as you probably have heard. And there's a reason for that, because I believe in law enforcement, the other group doesn't. It's always an honor to be with our brave men and women in blue and in brown, frankly, and in various colors because it's not always blue. But these are great people and you just don't do better. They're brave. They're under assault and they have a lot of difficulty with the laws of our land, and we're going to get rid of that difficulty because they shouldn't have difficulty. Our police men and women have the backs of law-abiding citizens every single day. They take care of what they have to do in some very adverse conditions. And I'm the—when we go back to the White House, you're going to see support the likes of which you haven't seen certainly in four years. Uh we worked very closely with the police all over the country, as you know, gave them billions of dollars of excess military equipment that was in warehouses all over the country that the Obama administration refused to give. And it was just drawing dust. Magnificent equipment, but it was just getting old, sitting in warehouses. And I hope you guys got some of it, did you? Because I gave it, and it was billions and billions and it was nothing going to happen, whether it, except the government was paying lots of rents all over the country for big warehouses. And it was an honor to have done it and it helped a lot of the departments very, very much. I want to thank Livingston County Sheriff Mike Murphy. Mike, thank you. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Where is he? Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Mike. What a great job. So respected, all of them. This group is highly respected. Mason County Sheriff Kim Cole. Kim, thank you. [applause] Van Buren County Sheriff Daniel Abbott. [applause] Thank you, Daniel. President of the Police Officer's Association of Michigan, James Tignanelli. James. [applause] Picking the wrong side. Where he is? Where are you? Come on over here, James. Let's go, get over here. [laughter] Come on. Is he allowed to stand with you guys? [laughter] I don't know. Stand up there, James. How are you? Thank you, James. Representatives John James and John Moolenaar, these are great warrior people. [applause] Wherever you are. Where's John James? There they—oh, look at you guys. You don't get the best location because you want your constituents to be treated so well, right, huh? Thank you both very much. We appreciate it. Done a great job. Your next US senator, he's really working hard and I just saw a poll, that—doing very well, Mike Rogers. Mike. Thank you, Mike. Congressional Candidate Paul Young, who is polling beautifully, I think. Paul, good luck. Good luck, Paul. You're going to do it. And Michigan House Republican leader, Matt Hall. [cheers] Matt, thanks. Oh, thanks Matt. Great. You look the role, Matt. Beautiful. Thank you very much, Matt. CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible] TRUMP: [laughter] You're right. That'll be next. Thank you very much. Michigan Senate Republican leader, Aric Nesbitt. [applause] Aric. Thank you, Aric. Nice seeing you again. Doing a good job. We're here today to talk about how we are going to stop the Kamala crime wave that is going on at levels that nobody's ever seen before. And she is, as you know, the most radical left person ever even thought of for high office, certainly for the office of president. People don't know the real Kamala, but I do. And people that do what I do, they also know. But she is so far left that nobody can even imagine and her real thoughts are there. You know—she's changing—they call her a flip flopper at the highest level that they've ever seen in politics because she's come out with policy for years, defund the police. You don't mind defunding, do you fellas? [looks towards police officers] Would you vote for a defunder? [booing] Would you vote—by the way, the people that you protect don't want defunders either, but she's been that until just recently, but she's always been for defunding the police. And the person that she's running with, Tim Walz, is equally far left. This is the most far left group. Nobody's ever seen anything like it, and the press is giving them a free pass. And you're not going to have—if it was up to them, you wouldn't even have the men behind me, people behind me, representatives behind me. You wouldn't have them. They wouldn't have a job. They think it's going to just police itself. Everything's going to take care of itself. Her father is, as you know, a Marxist professor, and he obviously did a good job, but this is where she's coming from. And you see her now with a smile, and she's gotten rid of the laugh over the last couple of days. I don't know. I haven't seen her laugh. [laughter] They've told her, ""Don't laugh, please."" [laughter] But I'll bet inside she was laughing last night when she saw the way Joe Biden left because that was a coup. That was a coup. And I'm no fan of his at all. And it started with the debate, and from that point on, it just got worse and worse. But that was a coup. It was a vicious, violent overthrow of a president of the United States. Since Comrade Kamala Harris took office, uh her administration's crime statistics show she's presided over a 43% increase in violent crime. These are all government numbers. 43% increase in violent crime. I'll bet the people behind me don't have anything like that. It just gets better. It doesn't get worse. Including a 58% increase in rape, 89% increase in aggravated assault and a 56% increase in robbery. The crime in America, the fact is is out of control. I watched last night in amazement as they tried to pretend that everything was great, the crime was great, the border was great, there wasn't a problem at all. No inflation, no nothing. There has been a report that the job numbers over the last period of time were fraudulent. And they—I understand that because I know how the job numbers go. And you want to be a bad person in high office you can be a bad person, but the numbers are going to be revised that the job numbers were far less at nobody's ever seen. 600,000 to a million people—jobs less. And let's see if that turns out to be true, but that's what the rumor is. It was reported by a very respected outfit, group, and we'll see what happens. But that's a terrible insult to our economy because we were seeing numbers that were okay, not great, but now we're seeing numbers that when they're adjusted are a disaster. But crime in America is out of control. I'm going to make it, along with the economy, inflation, strong borders and energy dominance, my top priority. I'm including crime in America. Normally, that's done locally. And uh we're going to give the local people a lot of help, like I did initially, but not that much. We had a lot of great numbers coming out when I was president. Now, we're seeing numbers that are just absolutely horrific. The Democrats are holding their convention in Chicago in order to showcase it. And yet, as you know, on 4th of July weekend, 117 people were shot. Of the 117, 17 were killed. This is 4th of July weekend. And 40 were shot last weekend. I don't know how many were killed, but assume a lot. And that's a war zone that's worse than Afghanistan that we read about all the time. Speaking of Afghanistan, the worst and most embarrassing day in the history of our country, in my opinion, we left 13 dead soldiers, 47 obliterated, just obliterated the arms, the legs to face, left people behind, and we left $85 billion worth of equipment behind for the Taliban to use as it sees fit. And they're selling a lot of it because they don't need 700,000 guns and rifles. They don't need 72,000 armor plated vehicles. They're one of the largest sellers of military equipment in the world right now. They're selling our equipment because they said, by the way, would've never happened with me. Abdul would never have done that, but they said we didn't have anybody shot. After my conversations with the leader of the Taliban, uh zero shot in 18 months. We had nobody lost in 18 months. He knew that he was not going to do that. I knew that. But now you look at what's happened and it's back, we would've kept Bagram. That's the big air base, not because of Afghanistan, but because it's located one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. So it's one hour away and we had it one of the biggest air bases in the world. We built it for billions and billions of dollars many years ago. Got the biggest runways, the biggest everything, and we just walked away from it, gave it to them, and now China's occupying it, and I thought that the scene a few days ago of the third anniversary, they call it the Defeat of America, was one of the ugliest scenes that I've seen on television in a long time. I've seen some pretty bad ones. So have you, we're witnessing some pretty bad ones. Uh they had a parade where the parade was uh all of our equipment, a lot of our equipment, brand new beautiful armor plated trucks coming down a road and people cheering. Not that many people cheering actually, but there were people cheering, but they were making us look very bad. We have a fool, a fool as a president. They lied last night about things that nobody's ever seen. They lied about soldiers at a grave site. They lied about Charlottesville, they lied about uh inflation. The inflation's been absolutely horrible, absolutely horrible, and everyone knows that we had virtually no inflation. They had 9%, but that wasn't including some of the things that went up more than anything else. They gave themselves a pass. But mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime free America. We want a crime free America. We're going to stop violent crime in the United States, and it's people like this that can do the job better than anybody. They do the job justly and fairly, but there's nobody like these people. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. There's nobody like them, so they can do it. They have to be given back their rights and their dignity. They have to be allowed to do their job. We're going to be uh guaranteeing immunities, and I'm not looking necessarily uh just here, but we have police in various areas that are pretty rough areas. If they do their job, if they're diligent in doing their job, they go after the police officer rather than the criminal. They lose their house, they lose their pension, they lose their family, they lose everything. They lose everything. Then we're going to make sure that doesn't happen. Over the past four years, the Marxist left has waged a vicious war on law enforcement in our country. They've taken away the dignity and the spirit and the life of some of these police officers, and that's why you see it. The crime is so out of control in our country. I mean, you have cities, I will say this, the top 25 almost all are run by Democrats and they have very similar policies. It's just insane. But you can't walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot, you get mugged, you get raped, you get whatever it may be, and you've seen it and I've seen it, and it's time for a change. We have to bring back our cities. We have these cities that are great cities where people are afraid to live in America. They're fleeing the cities of our country. What we would consider, what we did consider, you know interestingly like New York when I left for Washington, New York was we had a very bad Mayor de Blasio, but he wasn't there that long and he couldn't ruin what took place. But uh we had a city that was so wonderful and so thriving, and just in a few short years that changed, New York state is doing terribly. I heard the governor last night speaking so viciously and violently about me, but she doesn't speak about what they've done to destroy the state. The law enforcement has been decimated. The judges, what's gone on with the judges in New York? Nobody—there's no justice. We're not getting justice in New York. And yet she speaks so bravely about things that she shouldn't be speaking about. But you look at radical liberal Kamala Harris, she's been the ringleader for this anti-crime and the anti-police crusade. It's a real anti-police crusade. They uh just have it out for the police. Nobody knows why. I don't understand why from a common sense. I like to say the Republican Party is now the party of common sense. Conservative, yeah, I guess conservative. It doesn't matter. It's the party of common sense. We want to have borders. We want have strong police protection. We want a military that can protect us. We want great school, school choice ideally. We want have a good life. We want to be safe. But let's review Kamala's pro crime, anti-police record. She repeatedly endorsed defunding the police, which I said, and it said a level, and it never goes away. When you're a defunder or when you are even a politician, your first thought usually is the thought that you go with. If she ever had a chance, she would do whatever she could to defund the police. Cause, that's where her spirit is. That's where her heart is, and we can't have a president like that. She sponsored a bill to strip police officers of legal protection leaving you at the mercy of the lawless Marxist prosecutors who want to lock up police officers for sport. They lock them up in many cases long before they lock up the criminal and they go after them too violently. They don't go after the criminals. Murderers are released two hours after the murder. She wants to bankrupt the police unions. She wants to destroy policemen in general, and they ruin your lives, your jobs, and they ruin everything you've lived for, everything you've felt that you want to make great. You want to make our country great. When I'm President of the United States, again, we will never even think about or mention the words defund the police. We'll never think about that again. It's got to be put away. [cheers and applause] It's a bad situation. It's a bad concept. The concept is so chilling and so horrible to think that what we should be thinking about is the opposite of defunding, refunding you called. We'll refund, but we want to help the police. They have a very dangerous job lately. I see if somebody—I was with a great family a few months ago, opens the door to a car and gets shot and they have all sorts of protection for the people in the car. You can't have your gun even close to being drawn. You don't know what's happening. A lot of the windows are dark, so you don't know who's in there, but the door opens and just gets shot. Great police officer and many, many cases. A dangerous—it's a dangerous business and we have to give them protection and we have to give them love and respect, and that's what we're going to do. We were doing it and they're not doing it now. We'll give our law enforcement heroes the kind of protection and the resources that they so dearly deserve, and I will crack down on local Marxist DAs who refuse to enforce the law. They refuse to put murderers in jail, and you see it all over as the district attorney of San Francisco. Kamala Harris was one of the worst and one of the first Marxist prosecutors in America. She said that uh, and some people said she was the godmother of both sanctuary cities because this was a while ago. This was when it all started, and that horrible shoplifting epidemic. She shielded illegal alien crack dealers from deportation. She fought like hell to have crack dealers not deported. She came up with a concept of $950 and below. You don't even get prosecuted. $950, so guys are walking into stores with calculators to figure out, do you know that they have calculators? They adding it up. They want to make sure they're under 950, but it didn't matter because they didn't prosecute the ones that went over either. She ignored the pleas of victims, families members and refused to seek the death penalty against, as an example, an illegal alien, MS 13 gang member, these are the worst gangs in the world who murdered an innocent man and his two sons were absolutely no reason. They said, ""Why did you do it?"" He said, ""I felt like it. I felt like it."" So uh when Kamala, until recently was called a Marxist prosecutor, she didn't even disclaim the title. She sort of liked it. As the California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person as a nonviolent crime. All of them were redefined by her as nonviolent. Kamala Harris supports abolishing cash bail nationwide. Cash bail has been a disaster. When you abolish the no cash, no cash, don't worry about cash, you murdered somebody, don't worry about it. That was really the beginning of problems for New York. Big problems for New York, but elsewhere also. But it means releasing violent criminals immediately after arrest. No money involved. Don't worry about it. Go home. Enjoy yourself. Many of them disappear. You never find them again. Many of them immediately start killing again. It's just a crazy situation. She supports ending jail sentences for parole violators. She considers a parole violation not to be serious. When the violent mobs of looters and anarchists tried to burn down Minneapolis in 2020. Kamala Harris raised money, bailed to bail out the arsonists and the riders and the killers. People were killed. Many people were killed. Compare that to J6. Nobody was killed. Nobody was killed. There weren't fires set. They burned down the city. They were burning down Minneapolis, and she went out and not only did she work a little bit with them, she worked a lot with them. She worked to get them out and to set them free. One of the criminals Kamala helped bail out of jail was Shawn Michael Tillman, one of the worst, a dangerous repeat offender. Had a horrible record of violence. With Kamala's help, she was set free. He was set free. Soon, went on to murder a man on a train platform for no reason whatsoever in St. Paul, shooting him six times in the head and in the torso. No reason whatsoever. What's the reason? No reason, just felt like it. Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death. If she's allowed to be the President of the United States you'll see levels of crime that you've never seen before. I will deliver law, order, safety and peace, and I will protect those who protect us. These people protect us. These are unbelievable people. They protect us. We have to protect them. We have to give them hope because so many are leaving the forces. I can't speak for this group because I'd love to work for them. I would be joining them in two minutes. It looks like a nice job there. So they look because they've handled themselves and crime and everything else in a stern way, and it's probably uh a lot easier to do. Maybe we should switch them around to different territories of your state, of our nation and let some other guys take—would you like that fellers, I have a feeling you don't want that? I don't want to embarrass you. [laughter] I don't want to say any particular names of locations, but I can think of a big one in the state. I'd love to have them working there during the election, I can tell you, but no, but they have it all very much under control, and that's the way it should be. So we're going to make a record investment in hiring, retention, and training of police officers. We're losing tremendous numbers of police officers. These are men and women that want to be police officers and they're just leaving. We're going to get you reinforcements and we're not going to be doing the negative. Let's pay them much less or let's defund entirely. Let's pay them. There's a movement on now. We won't defund, but we'll pay them much less money. No. No. I've never realized how dangerous a job it was. I have some papers here where if you watch the event last night—this is by the way, [holds up chart titled Illegal Immigration into the U.S.] my all time favorite chart, which is because if you've watched last night, you wouldn't know that border was so bad. This was right here, this arrow on the bottom, lowest ever. This is made by border patrol. That's the lowest ever we had for illegal aliens coming into our country. And that was the week I left office. That's the lowest ever. Now, this chart is very dear to my heart for another reason. This was the chart. I said, ""Let me see. Let me see it."" But it says a lot, and we had a couple of instances last night where things were mentioned so I got it. Did crime rise under Trump and fall under Biden? They said it rose under Trump. And they go, ""No, the opposite is true."" Take a look at this here. [holds up report] It said, ""Is it true, did crime rise under Trump and fall under Biden?"" ""No, the opposite is true."" This was a study group that went out and doesn't care. They do the numbers. And there was another one that a historical comparison of the collapse of law enforcement in U.S. cities. The drop in arrest rates over the last few years is without precedent, lowest arrest rates we've ever seen. They don't arrest people anymore. And they shouldn't arrest people for saying the election was rigged, but they liked that. They go after guys like me, but they don't go after people that kill people. It's a shame what's happened in our country. But we're going to turn it around. We're going to win big and we're going to turn it around. We're going to turn it around fast. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. We'll bust up and dismantle the gangs, savage criminal networks and bloodthirsty cartels, and we will stop the Fentanyl, and we'll make sure that Kamala Harris has, and all of the people that she's allowed to come across the border—don't forget she was the border czar, whether she wants to hear it or not. CROWD MEMBER: Still is. TRUMP: She still is. Thank you. In fact, you could do it right now. They like to talk, it's all nonsense, that Donald Trump stopped a bill. I was opposed to it. So was everyone else. It was the weakest bill. Under that bill, millions of people would've been allowed to come in. This was a weak bill. But you didn't need a bill. I didn't have a bill. I said, ""Close the border."" And that's how we got to those numbers, the lowest ever recorded. I said, ""Close the border."" I didn't have a bill. I didn't need a bill. She doesn't need a bill. Biden doesn't know where he is, so where is he? Whatever happened to him? He got out. He got out. He's now sunbathing. He's in a beach someplace. But all he would have to do as president or her is say, close up the border and it's closed. But they don't want to close the border because when they first took over, I had built hundreds of miles of wall and I had 200 miles of wall in addition to what I said I was going to do because certain areas needed it. As we closed areas, other areas became um very, very strong in terms of people wanting to come through. So I bought 200 additional miles. It would've taken about three weeks to erect it. We're all set to erect it, then we had a terrible election take place, terrible election. And everybody here knows that. And I realized that they don't want to do it. And they actually sold that. And that was designed to the highest specifications of when you look at the steel, it's steel, it's concrete, 5,000 pound concrete inside and then rebar. And it also has a lot of technology wires and things in it for high technology. It was designed to the highest specs of the border patrol. I wanted actually concrete plank. I would've done a beautiful job with precast like you have in parking garages, long span. It's called long span precast. But they had to be able to see through. I understand that. They needed certain things that you can't do with concrete plank. So we did that, and very expensive to do because you needed all sorts—in other words, they wanted the steel, they wanted the concrete. It's all different methods of very hard to cut it, very hard to do it when you have different substances. And then very powerful rebar inside. And what happened is, as soon as they came in, they sold it for 5 cents on the dollar. They sold this stuff. Somebody made a lot of money because that steel is very valuable. But they sold all of that hundreds of miles of stuff. You saw it stacked up for a long period of time where they stacked it up in an area because Texas wanted to use it and finish the job. We built hundreds of miles. But Texas wanted it. They would've paid for it. They refused to sell it to Texas. They refused to sell it to Arizona. And they refused to sell it to anybody. They sold it to the junkyards, I guess, and 5 cents on the dollar. On day one, I will seal the border. I will stop the invasion. We had the border sealed. I had Mexico, I had thousands of soldiers from Mexico, free of charge. I said to the president, ""You must give us soldiers because they're coming through. The caravans are coming through your country."" ""No, no, no, I cannot do that."" I said, ""Yes, you'll do that. If you don't do that, I'm going to put tariffs on your cars."" And he said, ""I will do that, sir."" [laughter] And he did it. He did it very quickly. And it really, you guys heard all about it, made a great difference. We had thousands of Mexican soldiers guarding our borders that, look, they're coming through your country. You have to guard your southern border, which is their border on the other side. And all of a sudden they started and we had it. We had remain in Mexico. It's called Remain in Mexico policy, which we never had. And they stayed in Tijuana, different places, hundreds of thousands of people that didn't come into our country until they were checked. And then if they were good, we let them in. And if they weren't, we wouldn't let them in. And we worked well with Mexico, actually. But now Mexico has really taken advantage of our country. They want 200—they want billions of dollars just to talk. They wouldn't say that with me. They wanted, I think $2 billion to talk, right? ""We will talk. We want $2 billion before we even start."" That wouldn't happen with me. I would say, ""Oh really? Is that right? That's the end of trade with Mexico."" And they would say, ""Sir, we will give you two billion. How about that?"" So I'll send Kamala's illegal aliens back home where they belong. We have a problem because when I came in, they wouldn't accept MS-13 gang members. I told the generals we're going to get the gang members out. ICE and border patrol, the job these people do. But ICE would go into the country, get the MS-13 gang members out, the meanest, the most vicious. They kill people with knives. They killed two young students walking to school, two beautiful, young sixteen-year-old girls walking to school. They killed them up and chopped them up into pieces with knives. Dead. And ICE goes in and they go into those packs of rough, rough people and ICE is rougher than they are. These are incredible, brave patriots. A lot of people wouldn't want that job. You see fists and feet, you see everything flying. And then two minutes later, they stand up and they grab them and they throw them into what they used to call a paddy wagon. They put them into planes, say, ""Take them out."" The countries wouldn't take them back under President Obama. And I said, ""Really? They're not going to take them back? Well, if they're not going to take them back, I'm going to stop paying them."" I said, ""How much money do we pay these countries, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and others?"" I said, ""How much money do we pay?"" $750 million. I said, ""Good. Inform them we're not paying them anymore."" And the following morning, I got calls from all of these countries. ""Sir, sir, there must be a misunderstanding. We would love to take them back. [cheers and applause] We would love to have MS-13. We would love to have MS-13 back in our country. It would be a great honor to have them back."" And before we get too far, we're almost finished, but before we get too far, I want to tell you that we have criminals from all over the world pouring into our country right now. [looks towards police] Your job will never be obsolete. It will never be obsolete, unfortunately. It'd be nice if we could have peace, but we're not going to have peace. And this is something we're going to have to live with for a long time. She has allowed millions of people, open border, to flow into our country totally unchecked, totally unvetted. And they come from jails and prisons, slightly different. They come from mental institutions, all mental institutions all over the world. This isn't just in South America. People think it's South America. It's from Africa, Asia, the Middle East. A lot of people coming from the Congo in Africa, the Congo, rough, rough, rough. And they're uh prisoners. They're prisoners. And we say, ""Where do you come from?"" ""Africa."" ""Where in Africa?"" ""Prison."" ""What did you do?"" ""We don't want to say."" They turn out to be murderers. These are rough people. And we're allowing them into our country from all ov","er the world. From South America, yes, but from all over the world. They come from insane asylums. And many are terrorists. So we have prisoners, mental patients, mental institution patients, terrorists pouring into our country totally unchecked, unvetted. We have some of the worst terrorists in the world. We know where they are approximately, but we don't know too much. But we know they're the worst. We have the worst terrorists in the world pouring into our country. And she's the president and wants to be the President of the United States. She's vice president. She could do it. She's in charge of the border. She could have closed up the border. She should have closed it up. They could have told Mexico, ""If you don't do it, we're not going to do something."" We're not going to have trade. We're not going to deal with you. We're not going to let you sell your cars into the United States at these ridiculous, where they took 32% of our car industry over many years. They took it out of Detroit. They took it out of different places. But they took it and they took it big from this state, from South Carolina, from a lot of different places. They took 32%. And I think now the number is bigger. You know, I don't know if you know that they're building some of the biggest car plants in the world right now in Mexico. Wouldn't have happened with me. Right now in Mexico. And China's the one building them, and they think they're going to build, make these cars and then release them into the United States without tax. It's not going to happen. We'll put a hundred percent to a 200% tariff. We're not going to let it happen, because all of our jobs from your state will be gone. And I watched this union head, he's an incompetent guy. He's approving for what he did for what he's allowed every job, every autoworker here will be out of a job within three years if I'm not elected, every autoworker in the state. They're all going to be made in China. They're going to an all-electric policy. Well, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any country in the world, but we don't have for what you need for an electric car. But China does, and its territories do and we're not going to let it happen. But they're building some of the biggest plants. And I have a friend who builds plants. He said, ""Some of the biggest in the world,"" I think he's doing them, ""are being built in Mexico."" And they're going to sell cars, produce them, and sell them in this country with no taxes. It's not going to happen. I told him, I said, ""You better hope I don't win."" Always dangerous to say these things. Maybe that's why I get shot at and other people don't, right, John James? [laughter] That's probably why I get shot at. Other people, they will protect other people because they can't believe they got so lucky. But I have to do what I have to do. I have to do the right thing. The Border Czar Kamala Harris has allowed hordes of illegal alien criminals to literally stampede into our country. We're going to end that on day one. We're going to close our border. We're going to get all of the bad ones out, and we're going to get them out fast. In Shelby Township, Michigan, earlier this year, thirty-two-year-old, previously deported illegal alien, monster, was arrested for repeatedly sexually assaulting a young girl under the age of 13. Local law enforcement described the crimes as absolutely horrific and says he had many other victims, including death is involved. Death. Young girls. In St. Joseph County, Michigan, an illegal alien was recently charged with breaking into a home and sexually assaulting two very little girls, very badly assaulting. In Mississippi, just days ago, an illegal alien child predator was charged with raping a ten-year-old boy. And there were other cases where they were raping ten-year-old boys and girls. And in many cases, they were dead. They were killed. Last week, in Coney Island, two Kamala migrants were arrested for the rape of a forty-six-year-old woman, woman who was loved by so many people, throwing her to the ground and raping her over and over again, and then working her over with a knife to her throat. One of them had previously been arrested for raping another woman, but he was shielded from deportation by the New York City sanctuary laws, which Kamala strongly supports. She wants it very much. The woman said he didn't want to rape me, he wanted to kill me. She thought she was dead. She survived, but she thought she was dead. She said he didn't want to rape me, he wanted to kill me. This is what we're allowing into our country. And then you hear, ""Oh no, the people coming in, they're much less violent than the people"" That's not right. They're much more violent and that they make a hat. Sheriff, they make a hat, and I don't want to brag, but it says Trump was right about everything. And if you look, whether it's the border, this, I've been right about everything. Unfortunately. I wish I wasn't. [applause] So when I return to the White House, we will stop the plunder, rape, slaughter, and destruction of our American suburbs, our cities and towns. And I think that women living in the suburbs, I keep hearing about the suburban woman doesn't like Trump. Well, I think it's a fake poll because why wouldn't they like me? I keep the suburbs safe. I stopped low-income towers from rising right alongside of their house, and I'm keeping the illegal aliens away from the suburbs. I think that they like me a lot. I think it's a lot of fake polls. We've seen a lot of fake polls over the years. I was not supposed to win anything, and we won the big one. We won it and did a lot better the second time than I did the first. But women want to have safety. They want to have a strong military. They want to have a strong police force. They want to be in their house and they want to be safe. [cheers and applause] They don't want to have people pouring into their doors and you can't do anything about it. So I think that's number one thing. I hope they like my personality. I have a nice personality. But to me it wouldn't be very important, the personality. They want to be safe and they want people like this happy, and they want people like this taken care of properly because those are the people that keep them safe. So we'll shut down all deadly sanctuary cities throughout the country because all they do is they shield criminals. They basically shield criminals from prosecution. I will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement. We're going to put a lot of immigration enforcement. We're going to close down the border day one. And we are going to—just so you understand, I am not a radical at all. I'm just a common sense person that was successful in what I did because of the same thing. We are going to let people, and we want people, to come into our country. A lot of people, we need them. We need them for jobs. We need them for everything. We want people to come in, but they have to come in through a process. They have to come in legally. And we can let a lot of them come in, but John, we want them to come into our country legally. [applause] We don't want to let people come in who murdered 19 people and then you hire that person in a plant and all of a sudden you notice that people are being killed all over town. We want them to come in legally. On day one, we'll begin the largest domestic deportation operation in the history of our country, bigger than Dwight Eisenhower. Dwight Eisenhower was very—he was sort of a moderate person, but he hated when people poured into our country and he was very strong on deportation. We will remove all criminal aliens immediately. All of the criminals. We start with that. We're going to get them out of here fast. Nothing good is going to happen with thousands of terrorists being in our country. We had one month where border patrol was actually um does a chart, and I don't believe this. I love it in a certain way, but I don't. They said in 2019, zero terrorists came in. Now, I don't believe that, but it's an awfully good statistic. But it was very few that came in. We were very tough on that. We had everybody check so carefully and they added, actually, in 2019, they had zero. Now, you have thousands of terrorists coming into our country. Thousands of terrorists. These are the people that blew up the World Trade Center. Bad things will happen. And if I'm elected, we're going to get them the hell out of here and we're going to get them out of here fast. Very fast. And I told you that other countries who really, they put their people into groups, they send them up here, and by the thousands. The caravans, I think it was the name that I came up with, I don't know, maybe somebody will say ""he's lying about that, somebody else used the term 14 days earlier."" But we came up because it just seemed like an appropriate term. It's a caravan of thousands of people. We have one caravan coming up right now, thousands of people that go right into the country. But I call these—they wouldn't take the MS-13 people back or other criminals back. And the generals said, ""we are just not able to do it, sir, because they won't take them back."" They'd put planes on the runways so that you couldn't land the plane. They'd block up the bus lanes so you couldn't bring the buses and you couldn't get them back. And when I told them that they wouldn't get any more money, I said, ""let them know they're delinquent, they broken the deal. We're not going to get any more money."" We paid them, for years, hundreds of millions of dollars. The next morning, all three countries called me, like clockwork, separately. ""Sir, is there a misunderstanding? I understand that perhaps you would like to talk to us."" I said, ""yeah, you're sending people into"" And they're sending them, by the way. They don't want them. They're sending them. All of the countries are sending them, and now they're coming in because of her, because she's so pathetic and weak at the border. The worst job. The worst border czar in history. [applause] I can tell you that. Whether she's a czar or just in charge of the border, it doesn't matter. But they're sending them in levels that we've never seen before and they're destroying our country. But they all said, all three, it was almost like identical conversations, it was, ""sir, is there anything we can do to make up for this misunderstanding?"" I said, ""yep, you take your MS-13, and you take your gang members and you take your criminals and your drug dealers. We're sending them back and we're sending them back today."" And we sent thousands and thousands of people back. This has stopped for years. Under Bush, it stopped and under Obama it stopped. But this had been taking place for years, and I only found out about it, I said, ""that's good. Get them out."" I don't want to put them in our jails because we put them in our jails, what are we going to do? Keep them for 50 years, 60 years? And the expense. The really bad ones, we did do that, though, however, because we don't want them coming back. But all of them said, ""sir, we would be delighted to take MS-13 back. This would be a great honor. They're such lovely people."" And we took them out by the thousands. We took MS-13. ICE took MS-13 out of our country by the thousands and thousands and they received them, and that's the way. It's just another little story, but it's a story that's very important because I can't see a guy like Biden making that call. Do you think Biden thinks at night, ""gee, how are we going to get MS-13 out?"" He doesn't know he's alive. He didn't know he's alive. And this one is just a Marxist. She's a Marxist, Communist person, and we're not ready for a Communist president, okay? We're not ready for it. We're going to destroy our country. Under my leadership, no community will be surrendered to violent criminals. No citizen will be abandoned to migrant crime. We have a new form of crime. It's called migrant crime, and it's probably more vicious than the crime that we already have, which is pretty vicious. These people are vicious. And please don't let anyone convince you that our criminals, and we have more crime. They are sending massive number of criminals. And you've heard me say this before, Venezuela crime is down 72%. 72. Because they've taken their criminals out of Caracas, they've taken their criminals out of all of their cities, all of their areas, all over the country, and they're sending them to us. And I'm amazed that they're not doing it quicker, to be honest with you. It's happening fast. They're also emptying out the jails. And this is true all over the world. They're emptying out their prisons and they're taking their criminals off the streets. They're taking their drug dealers and their crime rates are down at levels that nobody's ever seen before. And everyone says, ""oh, so-and-so's doing a great job running such-and-such a country."" No, they're not. They're just very intelligent. I would do it, if I were them. I would do it much faster. I can't believe they still have some left. But their jails are getting to be very empty. And what they're doing is they're literally dropping them in. They're busing them in and they're bringing them in and they're saying, ""don't ever come back. If you come back, you get the death penalty,"" or ""if you come back, you get killed. Don't ever come back."" And you see the crime statistics are unbelievable. If you look at the jails, the jails are—they've never been so low in the world. I'm talking all over the world because they're sending their criminals to the United States of America and they're saying, ""don't ever come back."" And their jails are being emptied and their criminals are being taken off the streets and their crime rates are plummeting. But that's what we want for our country, so we're sending those people back and these are the people that can do it. [applause] We're going to have a reformed Department of Justice. We'll, once again, be a friend and partner to our great local police and police officers, general, and we'll be working with victims of crime very closely, but we'll not be working with the criminals that commit the crime. We're going to change it around. Right now, the criminal has a lot more respect within our Department of Justice than the victims. We're going to be working with the victims. We're going to get the gangsters, the drug dealers, the dangerous offenders behind bars, and we're going to get them ideally out of our country, ideally, except in extreme cases. We have some extreme cases where they've murdered many people. And in that case, we want to make sure they're away. But the amount of crime that we have is unbelievable and the lack of crime that these other places. It just makes so much sense, doesn't it? That's all common sense too. They're taking their criminals and they're bringing them to the United States and they look so great, and cities like Caracas, which was a very dangerous place to be, these are cities that have opened up, they have new life. But our country is suffering. And you know, they just got here over the last two years, mostly over the last couple of years, during this administration, during our great border czar who wants to be our president. They'll be laughing. Watch President Xi, will be laughing. Putin will be laughing. They'll all be laughing. By the way, the war with Russia would've never started with Ukraine, would've never started if I was President. October 7th would've never happened. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. This is a very dangerous time that we're in. It's dangerous in terms of crime and all, but it's very dangerous in terms of a possible World War III. We're very close to World War III and people don't realize it. We're closer than we've ever been. I think ever since World War II. But this would be the war of wars because of weaponry. This isn't, as I say, two army tanks going back and forth shooting at each other. The level of power, the level of weaponry that there is in the world today is so bad. It's so dangerous. It's so bad. And you need the right person to be President. We had no war when I was President, except that I totally defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. Everyone said it would take five years. It took me like about four weeks because we have a great military. We have great generals. Not the ones you see on television, not the ones that did the Afghanistan botchery, but we have great military people. I know them, and they're never going woke. You keep hearing our militaries going woke. The top people would like to see it, but it's never going to—these not people, just like these people will never be—[turns to police officers behind him] Do you promise you'll never be woke? [laughter] I don't see a lot of wokeness. There's not a lot of wokeness. [applause] I don't think so. But we're going to stand up for law-abiding citizens of America. We're going to be really, I think, an inspiration to the world. But we have to start by remedying a situation that was caused by somebody that right now is running for President of the United States. She would be a disaster as President. I love our country. I didn't need this. I didn't have to do this. I didn't need to get indicted by any time I fly over a state, they indict you. I got indicted more than the great Alphonse Capone, right? For nothing. My father's looking down, my mother's looking down. He was such a good boy. I don't know what happened. But I didn't need this. I had a beautiful life. But to me, I wouldn't change it for the world because we're going to take this country, we're going to make it safe again, and we're going to make America great again. And I want to thank everybody for being here, and God bless you all. [cheers and applause] Thank you. REPORTER: Mr. President TRUMP: Thank you everybody very much. Thank you.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373875",14224,"THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Milwaukee! (Laughs.) (Applause.) And hello to everyone joining us from exciting Chicago. The delegates at the Democratic National Convention -- well, they just completed their roll call. (Laughs.) (Applause.) And they have nominated Coach Walz and me to be the next vice president and president of the United States of America. (Applause.) And I thank everyone there and here for believing in what we can do together. We are so honored to be your nominees. This is a people-powered campaign, and together, we will chart a new way forward -- (applause) -- a future for freedom, opportunity, of optimism and faith. So, to everyone in Chicago and across America, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. And you're going to hear from our wonderful second gentleman shortly. I'll see you in two days, Chicago. (Applause.) Hey, Milwaukee! (Laughs.) (Applause.) Oh, it's good to be back in Milwaukee. So -- it's good to be back in Milwaukee. It really is. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you. So, as you know, the coach and I were together here in Wisconsin just two weeks ago -- (applause) -- and -- and the first rally after I announced that he would be my running mate. And it is so good to be back with all of you. (Applause.) So good to be back. And today, of course, I always and also bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. (Applause.) Wasn't he terrific last night? (Applause.) And I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation. (Applause.) Thank you, Joe. AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Joe. AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe!

THE VICE PRESIDENT: No -- no, we haven't already won. Seventy-seven days of work to do, my friends. (Laughs.) (Applause.) So, listen, make no mistake -- make no mistake: As we all know, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. This is not just about us versus Donald Trump. This is about two very different visions for our nation. One, ours, focused on the future; the other focused on the past. And, Wisconsin, we fight for the future. (Applause.) We fight for the future. We believe in the future -- a future with affordable health care, a future with affordable childcare, a future with affordable housing and paid leave. That's the future we believe in. (Applause.) We believe in a future where we build an opportunity economy, where every American has the opportunity to own a home, start a business, and build wealth, including intergenerational wealth. That's what we believe in. (Applause.) We believe in the future of our country. We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families. And when I am president, I will bring down the cost of groceries by making sure markets are competitive and fair. (Applause.) Together with Coach, we will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription medication for all Americans. (Applause.) We will take on the high cost of housing, understanding so many people are trying to fulfill the American dream and we need to give people help to get there. (Applause.) In fact, last week, I announced my plan to build millions of new homes and help first-time homebuyers with a down payment -- (applause) -- knowing that's a step to get where we need to go. And my tax plan will give 100 million more Americans a tax cut, including $6,000 to families during the first year of a child's life. (Applause.) That's about help with a car seat, with a crib, with diapers, with baby clothes. If we care about children, then let's help people -- help people -- (applause) -- do what they naturally want to do but don't always have the resources to do it. And unlike Donald Trump, I will always put the middle class and working families first. (Applause.) But now we know he has a different plan -- Trump. Right? Just look at Project 2025. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Now, if he is elected, understand what that -- you know, by the way, can you believe they put that thing in writing, right? So, that plan, though, tells us what they're up to. Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he wants to impose what is, in effect, a national sales tax, which will cost a typical family $3,900 a year. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Understand that. And on top of all of this, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And you remember what that was like, when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions? Do you remember what that was? Breast cancer survivors, children with diabetes, grandparents who need help and support being denied care. We're not going back. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back. We are not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will move forward. Just like Wisconsin's state motto tells us: Forward! (Applause.) Forward. Ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.) And it is a fight for freedom, like the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.) You know, I don't know what's up with these people, by the way. I mean, they just seemingly don't trust women. Well, we trust women. (Applause.) We trust women. And we know how we got to this place. We know how we got to this place, with now over 20 -- over 20 Trump abortion bans. We know how we got here. The former president, Trump, hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- with the intention -- with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And then, in state after state, they proposed and passed laws to punish women, criminalize health care providers -- in some states, not even making an exception for rape or incest. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And just yesterday, when he was asked if he has any regrets about ending Roe v. Wade, Donald Trump -- Donald Trump, without even a moment's hesitation -- you would think you would reflect on it for a second -- (laughter) -- said no. ""No regrets."" AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And that's because -- I do believe, you know, bad behavior should result in a consequence. (Applause.) Well, we will make sure he does face a consequence, and that will be at the ballot box in November -- (applause) -- in November -- in November. And I promise you, when I am president of the United States and Congress passes a bill -- (applause) -- to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) And, Wisconsin, in addition to that, as you all know, we are witnessing across our nation a full-on attack on hard-fought, hard-won, fundamental freedoms and rights -- across our nation -- like the freedom to vote -- (applause); the freedom to be safe from gun violence -- (applause); the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. (Applause.) So, we know what we're dealing with in this moment. And we must remember: As the generations of Americans before us who led the fight for freedom, the baton is now in our hands. (Applause.) We carry the baton. We carry the baton. And so much is on the line in this election. And understand -- we have to understand something: This is not 2016 or 2020. This is not 2016 or 2020. And, in particular, the stakes are higher for a lot of reasons, because we know what he does when he's in office, but including that, last month, the Supreme Court of the United States basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- for what he does in the White House. Now, think about what that means. Think about what that means, knowing the individual we're talking about. Donald Trump has openly vowed to be a dictator on day one. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He has openly indicated his intention to weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Think about what we know about him and what he's told us. He even called for, quote -- quote, ""the termination of the Constitution of the United States."" AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, let us be very clear. Somebody who intends to terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have the opportunity to stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back. We're going forward. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back. So -- Tim just looked at me and said, ""We're not going back, I think."" (Laughter.) So, Milwaukee, here's the thing, as you all know. It's why you are here. It's why you have taken the time to be here this evening. It all comes down -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: Kamala, I love you! THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back. And it all comes down to this. (Applause.) We're here -- thank you. But, yeah -- thank you. (Applause.) But here's the thing. Here's the thing. The reason that we are all here together, spending this time together, truly and deeply, is because we love our country. We love -- we love our country. (Applause.) We believe in our country. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We believe in our country. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. And I do believe -- I do believe that it is the highest form of patriotism -- the highest form of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country. And that's what we are here to do. (Applause.) And that -- and that -- and that is how we fulfill the promise of America -- (applause) -- the promise of America. And it is that promise of America -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: Medical! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We need a medical assistant here. Okay. We need a nurse. We need a medic here, please. Let's just make a -- let's make a path. Let's make a path, if you all don't mind. Just let's make a path to right here. Let's just create a path to right here. Let's create a path. (Applause.) Let's create a path, guys. And thanks for looking out each other -- look out for each other. But let's -- let's create a path for the medics. Okay. (Applause.) Okay. (Applause.) You okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. We're going to be okay. We're going to be okay. All right. (Applause.) Okay. We're going to be okay. This is who we are, right? This is what we're about: looking out for each other. The thing -- we care about each other. (Applause.) You know, it's about truly understanding what ""love thy neighbor"" means. (Applause.) It's about, in the face of a perfect stranger, seeing a neighbor, understanding what that love of each other means. (Applause.) It's a big difference between what we're talking about and what's on the other side. So, listen, I'll just -- I'll end with this point: the promise of America. The promise of America is what we are fighting for, and it is that promise that I think makes it possible that Coach Governor Walz and I would be sharing the same ticket. Think about that. (Applause.) Think about that. Think about it in the context of the promise of America. Two middle-class kids. One born in Oakland, California, to a working mom. The other, a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm. (Applause.) I worked at a McDonald's. (Laughter and applause.) But only in America -- only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House. (Applause.) Only in America. Only in America. (Applause.) So, my last point is this. In this election, we each face a question. And that question is: What kind of country do we want to live in? Right? Do we want to live in a country of chaos and fear and hate -- AUDIENCE: No! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- no -- or a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law? (Applause.) And the beauty -- the beauty of our democracy -- listen, the beauty of our democracy is we each have the power to answer that question. Each and every one of us has the power to answer that question. (Applause.) Each one of us. That's our power. The power is with the people. (Applause.) So, Wisconsin, today, I ask: Are you ready to have your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.) And when we fight -- AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you. (Applause.)","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374960",46300,"[music: Lee Greenwood, God Bless the USA.] TRUMP: Thank you very much. [cheers and applause] That's beautiful. This is quite a place. It's an honor to be here at Precision Custom Components, a company that has helped to build and defend America for over 150 years. That's really an extraordinary achievement. I want to thank you, President Gary Butler and the members of the wonderful Butler family, members of Congress, Scott Barry, and GT Thompson. You're here someplace in this very big factory, wherever you may be. There you are. Great people, great warriors I will tell you. My trade representative ambassador, Robert Lighthizer, who's fantastic at a thing called trade. We did very well at trade and you were fantastic. And I want to thank you, Bob, very much. And chair of the York County Commissioners, Julie Wheeler. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Julie, very much. Thank you. And a very special congratulations to all of the people of York County today who are celebrating the 275th anniversary of York County's founding. That's pretty good. [cheers and applause] That beats most of them out there. But most of all, let me thank the exceptionally skilled and talented workers with us in this room. I know you well. I know them from all over the country they come and they are the most talented people and the most brilliant people in so many respects. So thank you all very much for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you. [cheers and applause] For generations, the handwork of Precision Custom Components has strengthened the spine of America. Your products have gone into the Hoover Dam and atomic energy plants, nuclear submarines, and they currently are doing a lot of work. I'm here today to deliver a simple message. When I'm back in the White House, America's future will be built right here in Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] And it will be built by American workers like you. Be all over the country will be building, but Pennsylvania is always a big factor. And we've had great success, as you know, politically and otherwise in Pennsylvania. And we expect to have it again. We're doing very well here. Thank you very much. With your vote, we will unleash explosive economic growth and vast due prosperity for all of our citizens. We will put more money into your pockets and create millions and millions of new jobs. Gonna do it like nobody else has ever been able to do it. Our plan will massively cut taxes, unlock American energy slash regulations, big factor, crack down on trade cheaters and stop outsourcing, rebuild our industrial base and bring back those beautiful words ""Made in the USA."" [cheers and applause] And we were doing that four years ago and starting to do really well. And then we had to stop for an unknown reason. Together we will reclaim our nation's destiny as the number one manufacturing superpower in the world. We will do it and China won't even be close. Nobody will be. We had that going at a level that nobody's seen before and we're going to have it going again even better. And this firm and this people standing behind me and in front of me will be a big factor. Every policy in Kamala Harris's radical Liberal playbook sends jobs and wealth to other countries. [booing] The jobs go to other countries and the wealth goes to other countries. Every policy in the Trump agenda is designed to bring the jobs and wealth back home to America where it belongs and where it's going to stay. Kamala puts America last. I put America first. [cheers and applause] Some facts that are interesting. The year before I took office, the United States lost over 10,000 manufacturing jobs. Everybody said you'd never bring it back. But under my leadership, we created more than a half a million manufacturing jobs in less than three years. After decades of wage stagnation and income surged, we had a surge like nobody's ever seen before, but it surged for everybody during the Trump administration, every group, everybody, men, women. We had every household was at a level that they've never really experienced before. The typical American household saw their incomes grow by more than $4,200 per year. Everyone was better off when you had a gentleman named President Donald J. Trump at the helm. Does anybody know him,—[cheers and applause] whoever he may be? I kept every single promise I made to the workers of Pennsylvania and to every other place within our country. On day one, I withdrew from the unfair job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. And if I didn't do that, you wouldn't be open right now. You wouldn't have a job. That was a big thing. It was approved by another president who would've destroyed our manufacturing in this country still further. I imposed historic tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel and numerous other things that were unfair to our country and unfair to our workers. I ended the total disaster known as NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made by this country, and replaced it with the brand new USMCA. That's Mexico and Canada, the best trade deal ever made by our country, although I will tell you that I think the deal with China was probably even better. They had to buy $50 billion worth of our product, but after Covid, I don't even talk about that anymore, $50 billion they had to buy, and they were buying it too. I stood up to China like never before, bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars when no other president had gotten literally 10 cents from China, brought in hundreds of billions of dollars from China, never happened before. Nobody else literally got 10 cents. We passed the largest tax cuts in history, the largest regulation cuts in history, and built the greatest economy of the history of the world. We were at a level that nobody had ever seen before, and now we're going to do it again, but we're going to do it even bigger, better, stronger, and smarter. When I left office, I handed Kamala and crooked Joe Biden a surging economy with no inflation. You had no inflation. You had—Everything was good, great wages, no inflation. Now, you have inflation at levels that I don't believe anyone's ever seen before. The 30-year mortgage rate was 2.6%, but it was actually closer to 1.9 if you look at it the way that most people look at it. And gasoline had reached and was basically at levels of $1.87 a gallon, but we had months and moments where it was even less than that. Wouldn't that be nice, $1.87, Gary? [steps away from podium] That would be very nice. The family likes it more than Gary. Gary's been around too long. The family likes it more. Our economic future, it never looked brighter. When Kamala and Biden came in, they quickly blew it all up. Destroyed. 350,000 Americans joined the unemployment rolls last month. Did you know that? I keep hearing about their economy. Their economy's terrible, and the inflation is eating everybody alive, and it's been doing that for three years. The no inflation or almost no inflation, it kept going during the early part of this administration, this current administration, but it ended very quickly, and then it went to levels, and so quickly, it went so fast, and it was a shame. It was all blown up and destroyed, and jobs were lost. A lot of jobs were lost. Our country is doing really badly under them, and nobody wants to talk about it. The media doesn't like talking about it, because the Democrats, they really protect themselves. It's pretty amazing. Someday, the media is going to become real media instead of fake media, and you're going to see a big difference in the country. [cheers and applause] Real incomes are down $2,000 a year since she took office. Kamala casts the tie-breaking votes that gave us the worst inflation in American history costing a typical family $28,000. Under Kamala, we have fallen into manufacturing recession with 13,000 manufacturing jobs lost in the United States since just the start of this year. I don't know if you all know that, but that's what's happened. And it'll happen here, and it'll happen in this plant. It'll happen everywhere. If she gets in, if Kamala gets in, the United States will rapidly become a de-industrialized third-world nation like so many others have become. She's running on socialist price controls, banning gas-powered cars and trucks, and private health insurance policies are gone. She wants to defund the police, abolish cash bail. She wants to abolish it immediately, cash bail. She wants to abolish ICE, get rid of the incredible brave patriots of ICE who take MS-13 gang members, probably the worst gang anywhere in the world, horrible situation. They take them out, and they take them out bravely. They're strong. They're fierce, and they love our country. She wants to give free healthcare for millions of illegal aliens, and give them all citizenship into the United States immediately. She then wants to sign them up for Medicare and Social Security, and she wants them to vote illegally if possible, any way they can vote. They don't care if it's illegal or not, [booing] and they're signing people up as we speak. They're signing them up as we speak. They don't care. They don't care about the laws. Very simply, Kamala Harris is an economy wrecker and a country destroyer. Our country will be destroyed if she gets in. Her radical liberal agenda ruined San Francisco. It ruined California when she was the Attorney General. It crushed our middle class, demolished our border, set the world on fire, and now she wants to be promoted to the job killer in chief, but much more than job killer. Everything else is going to go bad. She set the standard in California. Think of this. If you steal $950 or less, they're going to leave you alone. They can't be bothered. So, you see criminals going into stores with a little computer adding it up, everything they've stolen. They want to stay under the 950, but they don't get prosecuted for above that. The only one that gets prosecuted is somebody who would talk about the unfair election. They get prosecuted. But when you steal and rob and kill and so many other things, when you sell drugs and destroy people's lives, nothing happens to you under Kamala, but we will not let this happen. We're not going to let it happen to our country. 78 days from now, Pennsylvania is going to tell her that we've had enough, that we can't take it anymore. Comrade,—[cheers and applause] comrade, Kamala, Harris, you are fired. Get out. You're not doing the job. Get out. [cheers and applause] You are fired. While Biden and Harris have been impoverishing our country, they have been getting rich, very rich at your expense. Now, it just came out, just was reported today by a great young reporter, Brooke Singman at Fox. According to a 292-page report from the House Oversight Judiciary on Ways and Means Committees in Congress, just got out a little while ago just before I got here. I said, ""No, I want to talk about it just briefly."" It's so sad, because he's going to be making his speech tonight, and they don't call him crooked Joe for no reason. They said, ""President Biden engaged in impeachable conduct, and said he abused his office and defrauded the United States of America to enrich his family."" Republicans revealed that since 2014, the Biden family and its associates received more than $27 million from foreign individuals and entities. They also found that while Biden was serving as vice president, the Biden family got more than $8 million in loans from Democrat benefactors, and they said that those loans have never been repaid. Those are the best kind of loans, aren't they? This report says in part that Vice President Biden actively participated in this conspiracy by, among other things, attending dinners with his family, foreign business, partners, and speaking to them by phone, often being placed on speakerphone by Hunter Biden. Republicans are calling out a 2014 dinner that Hunter Biden and his family attended with a Russian oligarch. They said that after that dinner, that oligarch wired $3.5 million to Hunter Biden's firm very quickly. It was a very quick wiring. I'm sure he worked very hard for the money. Several witnesses testified that Hunter Biden invoked his father in business dealings with Romanian, Chinese, Kazakhstani, and Ukrainian companies in addition to other companies and people, resulting in millions and millions of dollars flowing into the Biden family. As everybody knows, $3.5 million was sent from the mayor of Moscow, the mayor of Moscow's wife. Remember, I brought that up in the debate I had. I said, ""Why did this happen?"" And the anchor wouldn't let me ask that question. They thought it was inappropriate, but then it blew up. $ 3.5 million dollars was sent by the mayor of Moscow's wife to the family. They were also calling out Biden for his handling of classified documents. They said during his tenure as vice president, Joe Biden removed highly sensitive classified documents from the White House, despite having no authority to do so. And remember, comrade Kamala, she knew everything, and the senators knew what was going on. By the way, I had my own classified documents case,—and I was totally exonerated, totally. [cheers and applause] It was a case brought by Joe Biden and Kamala. She was involved. They did that in order to interfere with the election, and it still goes on different cases, but that was according to most the big one, and we were totally exonerated. The case was won a month ago. Very little coverage of the case being won, I must say. I think that a lot of the media didn't even talk about it. There's no way someone could have stolen that much money without Democrat senators knowing what was going on. He wined and dined them at Joe's houses. They saw his boats. They saw the way he lived. They saw his beautiful mansions. I would've made billions of dollars in this job if I wanted to play that game the way they played it, but instead, I took the job very seriously and very importantly. And you can see from the recently announced financial reports, I don't need the money, and I'm proud to announce that doing and being president, I lost billions of dollars, and I knew that would happen. Maybe not quite as much as that, but I'm satisfied with that, because we want to make America great again. That's much more important. We have to make America great again. [cheers and applause] Though, I could have played it the other way. I could have made so much. I see some of my friends over here. I could have made so much. No, I didn't want to do that. This is too important. This is too big a thing. We got to save our country, because our country is really in big trouble. We're a nation in decline. We're going down the drain. The drain is the swamp that you've heard so much about. They get rich, and in Washington, some of these politicians, what they're doing to our country is disgraceful, but he's one of the leaders of the pack. You have others. The number one step we will take to launch a great American manufacturing renaissance will be to end Kamala Harris' war on American energy. It's a war, and you do know that inflation was caused by her cutback on energy. Then what they did is they, in a panic, move shortly thereafter when the numbers for gasoline, oil, and electricity and everything else that comes from energy and out of energy. When they started going through the roof, they immediately went back to the Trump plan, but what they didn't go back to is my plan would've been doubled, tripled, and even quadrupled from the numbers I had four years ago. They didn't do that. They brought it back to a similar, because they were getting just absolutely destroyed by the numbers. It was going up, and you can bet that if we don't win, she takes over. Your energy numbers will be triple and quadruple, and you won't be producing a drop of oil. They ended the largest oil reserve anywhere in the world, probably as large as Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabia has this massive amount of oil. It's called ANWR in Alaska. They ended it on close to day one. They ended it. Ronald Reagan couldn't get it. No other president got it. I got it, and it's bigger than Russia, bigger than Saudi Arabia most likely. They seem to think biggest in the world they've been after. They've been after getting that approved for many, many decades. Ronald Reagan worked so hard to get it. He couldn't get it. I got it, and then they ended it. They were just set to start drilling. Everything was done, and he came into office. He ended it. On day one, I will tell the frackers and energy workers of Pennsylvania to drill, baby, drill, —[cheers and applause] and she's totally a non-fracker. You know that. Until a few months ago, she said, ""Oh."" It's just like on tips. We're not going to tax tips. All of a sudden, she comes out and she says the same thing, exactly the same words that I used months later, and other things she said, like trying to copy my policy, but it takes much more than copying a policy, because they're never going to produce it anyway. Our country's going to be in serious trouble, but she was a non-fracker, no fracking under any circumstances. She's like 100 times saying, ""I will not frack."" Look at her debates. There will be no fracking. There will be no — Then a few months ago, she said, ""Oh, we'd love to frack with a politician."" They go back to their original thought. There will be no fracking if she's elected in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. You'll have energy that will go up three, four, five times. You'll be paying $10 a gallon for gasoline, and a lot higher than that. Unleashing American energy will reduce prices, launch record-setting economic growth, create millions and millions of jobs, and produce higher wages for the American worker. You can't be a manufacturing powerhouse unless you have low-cost energy. We will have low-cost energy. [cheers] Electricity rates for a Chinese factory are more than 50% lower than the price of electricity for an American factory, and we were working four years ago at really getting it along, and then we were hit with uh? The Covid came in. We focused on that. We did a great job. If we didn't do a great job in that, we would've been in a depression like in 1929, which is where you're heading if she gets in. You're heading for the depression of 1929, that type. That's called the big league depression. Since Kamala took office, electricity prices in America up much more than 30% nationwide, and here in Pennsylvania, they're expected to increase by another 30%. They think it's going to be actually unsustainable for your state if she gets in. It's not sustainable. It's not sustainable for the country. That's why I've declared that a top priority for my administration will be to cut the cost of energy in half within the first 12 months of taking office. [cheers and applause] So, we'll cut it in half. I think we'll be able to do better than that. We're going to be cutting it in half, guys. That'll help you a little bit [inaudible]. CROWD MEMBER: Absolutely. TRUMP: I think we'll do that very quickly. That includes heating, air conditioning, electricity, and gasoline. Your bills will be less than half. When you look at the New England area, they pay some of the highest energy anywhere in the world because they can't put a pipeline in. They've been restricted from putting a pipeline in through a certain section of New York that is desperately wanting it. They need the job so badly. And if they did that in New England, the prices would come down half just with the pipeline alone. They were getting their gasoline and their energy from a place called Russia. Ships would pull up on the east coast, Russian ships, and that's where New England got it from, and they were paying a big price. And to this day, they're paying the highest prices, but we'll take care of that. We think energy costs, all of it, air conditioning, heating, all of it, including gasoline, will drop by more than 50% within the first 12 months. [cheers and applause] So remember that. That includes for factories. [cheers and applause] This will help us quickly defeat inflation and make America affordable again. By contrast, Kamala Harris wants to ban fracking. She supports a national carbon tax, which is a horrible tax that will destroy many businesses, that will have a huge impact on this business, but that will destroy a carbon tax. Nobody even knows what it is. Nobody knows how to calculate it. And she imposed a natural gas export ban, all catastrophic things for Pennsylvania. [booing] That means all the income coming in. For the most part, you'll have none of it. You'll lose 500, 000 jobs and you won't have the income coming up. That means Pennsylvania is going to have to pay, your commonwealth, your beautiful commonwealth is going to have to pay numbers that nobody ever thought even possible or worth discussion. Kamala is also on a regulatory jihad to shut down power plants all across America. Now, Germany tried it just a couple of years ago and they ended up getting rid of their political leaders very quickly, and now they're building probably 50 or 60 power plants currently, and they're looking to build a lot more. But they got rid of everything and they wanted to go to wind and solar and lots of other things. Unfortunately, it didn't work. They couldn't fire up the plants. The plants were closed and they couldn't get them going, and now they've gone to the other extreme. They've gone back to fossil fuel, I hope clean fossil fuel, clean coal. They do have clean coal. They have coal that actually has to make your electricity. And if you didn't have fossil fuel, you wouldn't have electricity because that's where it comes from originally. And you can have very clean and efficient natural gas. At least 50 existing power plants have closed since she took office, Kamala took office. They're closing them all over the country. They're closing nuclear. They're closing coal. They're closing everything. We're not going to have — That's why in California, you have blackouts all the time, constant blackouts, and yet they want to go to all-electric cars. Let's go to all-electric cars, even though we don't have enough electricity to give it ourselves some cool and some heat in the summers and the winters. I'm announcing today that when I return to the White House, I will end the anti-American energy crusade and terminate Kamala's so-called power plant rule. It's a disaster for our country. Our country will have no jobs by the time these communists and Marxists get rid of—I mean when they—when they destroy the country, probably can never come back either, just so you understand. Too much competition from other countries that are doing it right. We have a lot of competition out there. Not only China, we have a lot of other competition. Instead of shutting down power plants, we will open dozens and dozens more, and they'll happen fast. Kamala stands for energy disappearance and factory obliteration. She will obliterate factories like this. I stand for American energy independence and manufacturing dominance. We're going to be dominant in manufacturing. We're going to be dominant in energy too, not just um getting it to take care of ourselves. We're going to be selling it all over the world. We're going to be reducing our debt. We're going to be lowering your taxes still further. Don't forget I gave you the largest tax cut in history. We're going to be lowering your taxes still further. Upon taking office, I will do rapid approvals for new energy infrastructure, and we will embrace all forms of energy including nuclear. Nuclear is a great energy. This plant is making some things that I just got to see, and it's incredible what you've done, what Gary and the family have done. The level of complexity, the level of detail, the power that we're talking about is incredible to power our country into the future, including the electricity demands of AI and cryptocurrencies, which is a very big subject. It's coming up more and more, and we have to stay at the top. We want to be right at the forefront. Otherwise China and other countries will take it over. That's both of them, AI and crypto. We will make a historic commitment to bring in advanced small modular nuclear reactors online, building these massive plants that cost $20 billion and don't even get built like we had recently in a couple of other states. I won't mention the states, but they had two plants that got so out of control with cost overruns, massive, massive nuclear plants. Now we're going to do small reactors, small nuclear, we call it. France does that. France does very well with that. They do small. And if they need more, they build a second one, a third one, a fourth one. They hook them up together. With the help of companies like yours, these can be built ultra safe. They're ultra clean, and they're very low cost, but they are absolutely safe. Under Kamala's green new scam, billions and billions of taxpayer dollars are being sent to subsidize solar panel factories, windmill factories, battery production and car production all based in China. We are subsidizing massive amounts of product for solar, for wind. It's all made in China. Under the Trump administration, we will build American, buy American, and hire American. [cheers and applause] That's what we're going to be doing. Kamala's economic agenda rewards outsourcers and punishes American workers by making it economically impossible to manufacture in America. What I'm promising today is a total pro-American overhaul of our tax regulation and trade systems to promote domestic production and punish those who ship jobs and factories overseas or to places like Mexico, where right now, the head of the United Auto workers doesn't know this. They're building some of the biggest car factories, just started, anywhere in the world. The person I know builds car factories. That's all he does, build car factories. He said the biggest ones in the world are being right now in Mexico. And they think they're going to bring those cars in, make them in Mexico, bring them in here, and sell them to our people and destroy Detroit and the rest of our car business. They've already taken 30% before I got there, 30%. They did nothing against us when I was there. I told them, ""If you want to build car factories, you're going to have to pay a 100% tariff to get the car into this country."" They immediately said, ""Well, I guess we're not going to build a car factory."" Right? That's what happened, but now they're building the biggest in the world right in Mexico, and they think they're going to take our car. They're not going to do that if I'm here because I will be putting massive tariffs on those cars coming across the border, and it won't make any economic sense. So I actually think they should stop building them unless they want to sell those cars to another country. Kamala wants no taxes on Chinese producers, wants no taxes. What's that all about? While imposing the largest tax hike in the history of our country on factories in the United States. Okay, so she wants a no tax policy on China, but she wants to tax factories like this and other factories at levels that they've never seen before. Under her plan, manufacturers will pay even higher taxes in America than in Communist China. By contrast, I will pass gigantic tax cuts for workers and keep their jobs here in the United States. They're going to stay here. [cheers and applause] We're going to beat everybody. We're going to beat them like a drum. [cheers and applause] And we were doing that against China. There was a long-time expression that China will take over the world's largest economy. It'll take it over in 2019. Well, in 2019 we were doing so well, 2018, 2017, that China never even came close. We were lapping them. They never came close. And even President Xi said congratulations. They thought they would be—long time, this is 15, 20 years ago, they said, ""2018, 2019, China will dominate."" Nope, we were doing—It would never happen. In fact, I said after we started really doing it, as long as we have smart presidents, they'll never catch us because they can't beat our system. We will have big tax cuts for families and small businesses, and we will have no tax on social security and no tax on tips. [cheers and applause] So they haven't copied Social Security yet, but they will. Don't forget, he's the one that destroyed our seniors with inflation. Inflation has destroyed our seniors. It's the worst thing that could happen. The people that behaved the best that did it the American way, that saved their money, they got decimated because their money went down because they couldn't live. They were losing money. With me, they were putting money in the bank and making a lot of money. They were saving a lot of money. After I left, they were losing all of that money they saved. Kamala wants to spend $1.7 trillion in wasteful spending, causing more inflation. And she says it's a mistake to ask her how she's going to pay for it. ""Please, it's a mistake."" She just said it. She just said something that nobody has any idea what she said, but she said it's a mistake to ask how we're paying for it. Kamala Harris can't answer how she'd pay for any of her new radicalized liberal spending schemes that will bankrupt our country, and do it quickly, destroy social security, destroy Medicare. She has no clue how'd she pay for $25,000 to every first-time home buyer, including illegals, just like they were going to pay the bills of college students. Unfortunately, that didn't happen and won't happen. They gave up that. Supreme Court gave it up because it was unfair to all of those people. One of the reasons, all of the people for years and years that paid back their loans, and now we're going to give something free, but it didn't happen. It was just talk. He knew it wouldn't happen too. Crooked Joe, he knew that was not going to ha","ppen. No clue how she'd pay for free healthcare for illegals. She wants to give free healthcare to illegals. Now, you want to stop people from coming into our country, the first thing you do, and you would have to do this immediately, no healthcare. We can't do that. We can't afford it. It's not sustainable, but they're doing it. Just the opposite. Come to America. Live the American dream. We'll give your children free schooling. We'll give you free healthcare. We'll give you pensions. We'll put you into social security. This is why people are pouring into our country—in the caravans. That's a very dangerous trip. Thousands and thousands of people are dying in those caravans coming up to our country, and they're coming up because the promises are being made to them that just can't be kept. No clue how she'd pay for the $100 trillion, think of that 100 trillion with a T, dollar green new scam. It's a scam. Out of the $100 trillion, you wouldn't—There's not $1 of it that would help our country, not $1 of it. It'll destroy our country. And no clue how she'd pay for the hundreds of billions of dollars in new foreign aid giveaways. We're giving away money at levels that nobody has ever seen before. No other country would do it. No other country would be so stupid to do it. That's why it's so important to vote for Trump to stop the reckless spending and the destruction of our country. We will not have a country left. I will stop the special interest giveaways, cut waste, and restore common sense to our government. The Republican Party is the Republican Party of common sense. [cheers and applause] That's what it is. Kamala will bury American workers in regulations. I will liberate our workers with the largest regulatory cuts ever recorded. We've already done some of them, but she put them right back. They put them right back. Repealing every single job killing regulation of the Biden-Harris administration. The electric vehicle mandate, which is absolutely so crazy, will be gone, and there will be no costly forced transition to all electric cars and trucks. If you want a gasoline propelled car or a hybrid or an electric car, they're wonderful too, but not all. People need to go longer distances. They want to pay less money. Fantastic. Electric is fantas—Everything is great. You have to be able to buy everything. They have a mandate. We don't have enough of electricity for ourselves, and now they're talking about putting all the cars on it. Well, it doesn't work because the cars don't go far. If you'd like to go from here to, let's say Washington to look after we fix the capital up and make it safe again, which will take approximately like quickly,—but after we fix it up, and if you want to drive there, you don't want to stop five times, you want to be able to go there and you want to be able to enjoy it, and you don't want to be mugged or shot or killed in our capitol, which has become very unsafe. It's horribly run, graffiti stained, and we're going to fix it very quickly and beautifully. We're going to make it the most beautiful capitol anywhere in the world, and we're going to make it totally safe. Police are going to do a great job. Simultaneously, we will modernize our trade policies. The United States has long been taken advantage of by other countries at levels that nobody has any idea. I would sit and look at these trade deals, many of which we renegotiated with Japan, with South Korea, with Canada, Mexico, many. But I'd look at these deals before we did the renegotiations and say, ""Who would make deals like this?"" I mean, they were either crooked or really stupid, one or the other, probably crooked for the most part because I don't think they're stupid. But we had the worst trade deals. No country's ever had trade deals like. We fixed many of them, made some of them extraordinary. We lose jobs in revenue. They gain everything. We lose jobs. We lose revenue. They destroy our country. They gain everything, and they wipe out our businesses, which is good for them because then they can supply us with whatever we were making. I stopped it four years ago and I will stop it very quickly again, and we'll be making the product ourselves with our labor. We will not let countries come in, take our jobs, and plunder our nation into poverty. [cheers and applause] The way they will sell their product in America without having to pay any substantial tariff for tax is to build their factory in America and build their product in America using only American help, and we have the help. [cheers and applause] Kamala Harris says that a tariff is a tax on American consumers. She's wrong. It's a tax on a foreign producer. It's a tax on a foreign country, and I proved that better than anybody because I took in hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs on different states, on different countries. And out of all of that money, we had no inflation. We had no inflation. It also gives you power over that country. If they want to have wars with somebody, we can say no. If you do have wars, we're going to raise your tariffs. Oh sir, we won't have a war. We're okay with it when we've decided not to go after somebody. One thing a little off this, everybody said, ""Oh, we might have wars with Trump."" We had no wars with Trump. First time in 78 years, we had no wars, other than I finished some like ISIS. [cheers and applause] 100%, defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. What they did is Afghanistan, the most embarrassing day in the history of our country. And none of the generals got fired for the incompetence that they showed. Most embarrassing moment. We would've left with dignity and strength. We would've taken our $85 billion worth of equipment. We would've taken our hostages. We lost 13 great, great people. We had 47 people obliterated the arms, the legs, the face obliterated. What a horrible day it was. What an embarrassment. What a horrible day to have death, to have such injuries. Nobody talks about the 47 people that lost their limbs that will suffer for the rest of their lives. As I've said many, many times before, as tariffs on foreign countries go up, taxes on American workers and families come down. According to one recent study, a small 10% tariff on foreign-made products will allow massive tax cuts for working families. Create more than 3 million American jobs, raise household incomes by 6%. Think of that. [cheers and applause] And the 6% equates to $4,200 a year for a household, and generate almost a trillion dollars in economic growth. And it will go very quickly. It will also get rid of a large portion of our deficit. Because we don't want countries coming in here, stealing our jobs, hurting our country, killing our workers, leaving with everything, and we as usual end up with empty factory buildings that are falling down. We end up with nothing. We want tariffs. If somebody wants to come in and take our jobs, if somebody wants to come in and sell us their product that's made in their country, that's okay, but they've got to pay tariffs. They've got to pay a price for that. We're going to bring down your taxes at levels never seen before. We're going to pay off debt of our country, because this country owes $35 trillion. But that rapidly can come down. And remember this, we're sitting on the largest amount of oil and gas. We have, I call it liquid gold. We have more liquid gold than Saudi Arabia. We have more liquid gold than Russia, but we don't use it. We go out and we buy from other countries at ridiculous prices. We buy now from Venezuela, we buy tar. It's not really—It's tar. And you know where we refine it? At a factory. Only one factory in the world can do it because of the nature of it. It's tar. It's not good stuff. It's in Houston, Texas. So all of that, if you're an environmentalist, all of that's going right into the air in our country. We bring in lots of tar, loads of it. We dump it in Houston, and they refine it. We have pure stuff. We have the best and we have the most right under our feet. It's liquid gold. And we're going to use it, and we're going to reduce our deficit. We're going to reduce our debt, and we're going to reduce your taxes. We're going to do everything right, and it's going to happen quickly too. [cheers and applause] And as we reduce burdens on US manufacturers, our workers can make goods better and cheaper right here in our own country, and right here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We don't need lectures on the economy from a candidate pushing communist price controls. Kamala has no idea what the hell she's doing. Her father is a Marxist professor, and I believe he taught her well. You know he's a Marxist professor. Can you imagine? Does anyone know that? I wonder if they knew that when they did an overthrow or a coup on Joe Biden. I wonder if they knew where she comes from, where she came from, what her ideology is. But you could see it a little bit by this whack job. You know, he said, we are weird. That JD and I are weird. I think we're extremely normal people, like you, exactly like you. He's weird. Did you ever see him go on the stage and go like crazy? It's like between his movement and her laugh, there's a lot of craziness. I'd say a step further than weird. Weird is a nice word by comparison. When I'm president, we're going to do things right. And when I was president, we imposed historic tariffs and prices, and we did it all. We did it all. Prices didn't go up. Everybody said, ""Oh, if you do that, prices."" No, the country made less money. That's what happened. Gave us tremendous political leverage over those countries too for things having nothing to do with economics. They heard China, not America. That's why the Biden administration had no choice but to leave them in place. They've left them in place. They wanted to take them off. But so much money comes in from China and other places with the tariffs that I put on, that Joe Biden, as much as he wanted to do his friends a favor, couldn't do him too much money. You couldn't justify it. There was no way to justify it. And my next term, I will revoke China's most favorite nation trade status. It's very unfair. [cheers and applause] And by the way, I have great respect for President Xi. I think China and the United States will get along well together. Until COVID came in, that was a step too far. But I had a great relationship with President Xi. I had a great relationship with most of the leaders. I'll pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if China or any other countries, not just China, the European Union treats us very badly. Nobody knows that. Very badly. We have a 250 billion deficit now with the European Union. But if China, or the European Union, if any other group of countries or country makes us pay a 100% or 200% tariff or tax, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff or tax of the exact same amount. So it's basically, you hurt us, we hurt you. It's an eye for an eye, and it's common sense. [applause] We will ensure that we have 100% domestic American supply chains of all essential goods. Our supply chain has crashed. And you don't write about it now, but it still crashed. And all you have to do is say, ""Where's the package that was supposed to be here three months ago?"" People aren't getting them. It's very bad what's happened. They've destroyed our supply chain, which is something I didn't think could be done. COVID proved that if we need it in a crisis, then we must be able to make it in America. We want to rely on ourselves. We have no choice. This is really a matter of national security. We will bring back electronic production. We're going to bring up electronics too. Electronics, we buy everything —away. When you see the sophistication of the product I just saw at this place, electronics is peanuts by comparison, but pharmaceutical too, it's outside of this country. 95% we're reliant on various other countries, good countries, nothing wrong, but we want to do it ourselves. They make a tremendous amount of money, and we lose our jobs. And we want to do it ourselves. Mineral production, car production. We're going to bring back the auto industry. We can do that. We can do better than anybody in the world. They've stolen 59% of our car making business. The union, the United Auto Workers. I think the people in that union are going to vote for me overwhelmingly, because I'm going to bring car industry back. They are destroying it. When they agreed to all electric cars, they're not going to be made in this country. We'll be making no cars in this country. And I was the one with South Korea, they got the tax put on and extended on the small trucks. And if I didn't have that tax, the most successful product made in this country is the small trucks. If I didn't get that tax, South Korea and China would be destroying us now with additional product. We saved them. So I hope the autoworkers are listening, because they have a union boss that doesn't have a clue. He doesn't have a clue. It's sad. I wish he did. I don't have to like him. I wish he did. But he doesn't have a clue. What he's done to the auto business in allowing this to happen, where all of those cars are going to be made in China and it's going to happen quickly. With the help of companies like this one, we will rebuild our hallowed out defense industrial base, ensuring that America is never in a situation where we don't have tanks, missiles, the raw materials to fight and win a war. We have to have those. What would happen if we had a war? We won't, with me. But you will have World War Three, I believe, without me. But we won't have. But what would happen if we did? And let's say it was with China, but they give us all of our steel? So we'll have to call China for steel so we can fight a war with them. How stupid are these people? Upon taking office, I will invoke the Defense Production Act wherever it's necessary to quick—very quickly ramp up capacity of essential products. And I will stop Japan from buying United States steel. [cheers] We have a foreign country that wants to purchase one of our greatest. If you go back 70 years, our greatest country, our greatest company by far was United States Steel Corporation. That was the big deal. And now we have Japan buying it. They shouldn't be allowed to buy it. We have to make it work. We have to make it work. You don't want to sell US Steel. This is how we will rediscover the industrial heritage of our country. We will reclaim our manufacturing legacy. We will build up glorious American future fueled by Pennsylvania energy. You're one of the largest in this country. You're one of the largest producers in the world. She doesn't know that. You're not going to produce. You're going to go from being one of the largest producers in terms of fracking, the energy produced into a non-factor. Your state's going to be third world, like much of our country is being made third world by these people. They don't have a clue. But it's going to all be made with pride of the US and with Pennsylvania pride, and strengthened by strong, powerful Pennsylvania steel again. With your vote, we will destroy inflation, bring down prices. And prices are going to come down very substantially. Achieve incredible economic growth, make America wealthy again, and we will bring back, most importantly, we're going to bring back a thing called the American Dream. The American dream is dead. Right now the American dream is dead. We're going to bring back the American dream. So vote for Trump on November 5th. We will be the most—[cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. CROWD: USA!, USA!, USA!, USA! TRUMP: Thank you to Pennsylvania. The reception coming here with the people outside waving, it was a beautiful site. The love that they have for what we're trying to do, and what we will do. I just leave you with this. Vote on November 5th or sooner. November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. We're going to turn our country around. We're going to make America great again. Thank you everybody. God bless you. [cheers and applause] God bless Pennsylvania. God bless America. Thank you very much everybody. [cheers and applause] [music: Lee Greenwood, God Bless the USA.]","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373857",7847,"GOVERNOR WALZ: First of all, Coach, thank you. To each of you, thanks. I know we're interrupting your practice. The busy part and the important part is out there on the field, but thank you for having us on this. MR. PATRICK: Appreciate it. Thank you for coming. GOVERNOR WALZ: This is a -- this is pretty sacred ground. Folks in Minnesota know about this place. We know about this team. We know the people you produce -- not just FN- -- NFL players but -- but men of a character that come out of this program, because, as Doug said -- I'm privileged to be on this team -- I'm the current governor of Minnesota, but for 20 years, this was the time of year I looked forward to most. I was a defensive coordinator at Mankato West High School and coached football and -- and taught school. Public schools are the foundation of our country. And I don't have to tell you, anybody who tells you that it's just a game -- this is more than just a game. This is about building character. It's about doing something bigger than yourself. It's about trusting the person that's standing on each side of you, and, on Friday night, you know they'll be there. And if you look around here, the moments that you're living right now, these guys will be around your whole life. You'll remember them. You'll remember these plays. I can still remember every single call during that state -- first state championship, how it went. It's that important. I've told people, and they think I'm joking about it, it was harder to win that state football championship than it was to become governor, so -- (laughter) -- it's tough work. You got to count on a lot of things. You got to do a lot of things. And on our team, we ran a 4-4 defense. (Addressing Jerome Bettis.) I wouldn't have wanted to go against this guy, I can tell you that, but -- (laughter). There's no stopping that run. But the kids played hard and -- and they understood that it was something bigger than themselves. And I'll have to tell you, being out here with -- with Vice President Harris, I know it'd be easy -- especially now, our politics has been pretty ugly. Our politics has seemed pretty negative. Our politics is something that I know what I fear most is, is that young people turn away from it rather than turning into it. Politics isn't that much different than this. It's about something bigger than themselves. It's about setting a future goal and trying to reach it. It's about doing it with dignity and hard work. It's about doing it with humility. And when you lose, you walk across the field and you shake hands with the other team and know they played hard too. But we're all in it together to try and make it better. And things like investing in this public school and having -- I can't imagine what this place looks like when it's filled with folks and the lights are on and the leaves are turning and that game is in the fourth quarter and somebody has to make that play, somebody has to step up, and you look to each side of you and you know, ""I trust them. I trust them to make that play."" Our country's not that different. Our neighbors want to be with you. Our neighbors want to do what's right. And the more we figure out that we're in this thing together and we have more in common than we have separated, we're going to do a heck of a lot better. So, I have to tell you, thanks for taking some time. Thanks for giving us the privilege to stand on this field, because you earned the right to be on this field. You earn it with a lot of sweat. You earn it with a lot of time in the weight room. You earn it with the folks who came before you and know that they care how you conduct yourselves on this, and we feel the same way. We have a responsibility to the American public to conduct ourselves with dignity, conduct ourselves with a vision, and to conduct ourselves and all of this -- when football's done right, it is just fun as heck to play the game. And that's the way things can be. So, I have to tell you, I am just honored to be with this leader. I'm honored with someone who's showing us that. I'm honored with someone who's out doing politics with a smile on her face and with a sense of that everybody matters. And we're here in this space to say -- it's not just a cliché -- our future is with you, and we have a responsibility to deliver it to you in good shape, to make sure that we're doing the right things to give you a good shot at the future. And so, for me, it's a privilege to be on this team. It's a privilege to see this leader do it with such joy. And it's a privilege for me to get to introduce to you -- and this is, like, some of the first times I'm getting to do this -- the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, I've been reading about you all and hearing about you and your excellence and how you work as a team. And we've got 79 days to go until the election, but we wanted to stop by and I wanted to stop by so I could tell you all in person, looking at each of you in your eyes, that our nation is counting on you and your excellence. We applaud your ambition. You want to compete. You want to win. And I will tell you that we, as a country, deserve to give you every opportunity that you have to achieve your excellence that you were born with, that is God-given, and that is going to be laying the path to the future of our nation. You all are the future of our country. And you all have known from the day you were born, we're all born leaders, and it's just a matter of when people decide to turn that on. The fact that you're on this field today tells me you decided to turn it on at an early stage of your life -- to be a leader and to be a role model. And, you know, it's not easy being a role model. Welcome to the role model club -- (laughter) -- right? Being a role model, Pete, means that members of your family, people you know in the neighborhood, others, your classmates, they watch you to see what you do. What goes into that kind of excellence? What goes into being a winning team? And you all have taken it upon yourselves to take on that responsibility of being role models and to inspire people you may not even know are watching you to see how you can achieve success. And by doing that and all that that requires -- which is the hard work; the practice; working as a team; knowing that you will be undefeated, even if you don't win every game, but no circumstance or event or moment will defeat your spirit and your fight and your preparedness to win and excel, that nothing will dampen your spirit of excellence -- that's what I'm counting on from each of you and that's what makes our nation strong. So, you keep doing what you're doing and know that there are so many people you may not see at any one moment who are cheering you on. When they're in the stands, when you're in your classroom, when you are living your life on a daily basis, know that we are applauding you in everything that you are and do -- on this field when you are playing and off this field when you are just being the leaders that I know you are. You wouldn't be able to be such a successful team if you weren't leaders in every way. And the last point I'll make is this. One of the other things that we really are counting on for your leadership is to remind folks that we are a team, right? Everybody has a li- -- little bit that's different about them. But within the vast majority of us who have seemingly differences, the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And you guys know that. You know that in the way you operate as one team. So, take that spirit with you in everything that you do. I'm counting on your leadership. Our nation is counting on you guys. And go out and win some games. And I'll see you later. (Laughter.) Okay. Thank you. (Applause.)","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373858",10175,"GOVERNOR WALZ: Oh, man -- (applause) -- it is. Doug gets the bro hugs. He brings it, so -- (laughter). Well, thank you, and it's true. And -- and to Gwen and Doug, both, I -- all of you -- none of us do this alone. We're all in this together. I think this is a room that knows this campaign will be won in rooms just like this all across the country. (Applause.) It will be run with people sitting on the phone banks in there, dialing numbers, and people picking up the phone on a Sunday and having somebody say, ""Do you have a minute to talk about the future of our country?"" That's a pretty big step to pick up that phone and talk. But listening to these folks in here, people are doing it. They're doing it. And the thing I can tell you what Kamala Harris has brought to this for so many things -- from experience as a prosecutor to an attorney general to a United States senator to a vice president to the next President of the United States -- (applause) -- th- -- there's that resume, which is out -- without question, but the reason they're picking up the phone and the reason that they're standing thousand deep in 109 degree heat in Las Vegas is: She's bringing out the joy in the hearts of Americans. She's bringing out -- (applause) -- she's bringing out the kindness that ties us together, the decency, the vision of a better tomorrow. And these -- (applause) -- each of these volunteers and the people who put it on, they all said it. They said it is so much better to be for for something rather than against something -- to be for the future, not going back. Those -- (applause) --that's what people know. And we -- some of us who have less hair and are old enough -- can remember when you could go to Thanksgiving, watch a Steelers game with your relatives, and not complain about politics the whole time, not be on each other's neck -- (applause) -- because you shared a commitment to democracy, a commitment to personal freedoms, a commitment to public education, a commitment to infrastructure. (Applause.) We don't call each other names. We don't do it. And we don't use the least fortunate amongst us as punchlines for our jokes because they're our neighbors. They're our neighbors. And so, you're getting an opportunity to see the best side of America. And for the young people here, they maybe haven't seen a campaign like this because of COVID, because of things that's happening. This is a chance to bring out that joy, turn the page, and look to the future, this idea of going forward, so -- (applause). Doug -- Doug is right. He told you my kids were backstage in awe. He didn't tell you they were probably in awe because they could not believe that I got through that thing and through that speech -- (laughter) -- that that was amazing to them. But I'll tell you what, they have felt part of this family, because they can feel the decency radiating off these people. They can see the commitment. They know that children matter. They know that family matters. They know that individuals matter. And this leader knows that it's not any of government's business to be in your health care decisions. Those are your decisions. (Applause.) And this is a leader who celebrates love in all forms that it comes by -- (applause) -- that we love each other. And for the young people, you hear somebody talking about this: We have the right to send our children to school to be free from being shot dead in their classrooms. That's what it is. (Applause.) And this is a nation -- can ensure clean water, clean air, and a bright future for our children. So, I have to tell you, we've got 79 days. And you'll hear me say this -- Doug is going to correct me on this -- I say, ""That's easy. We can sleep when we're dead."" He s- -- (laughter) -- Doug said we can sleep on November 6th after this election is over, so he may be right. (Applause.) But, look, coming into football country and being an old football coach, there's an old saying, ""You -- you don't hope you're going to win. You prepare to win. And you give it the best you've got. And you know when that game's over, you want to know you left it all on the field."" And that's all we're asking. Let's leave it all on the field. Let's get this thing done, because -- (applause) -- because when my grandkids and your grandkids ask you about this -- because on Nomber -- November 6th, you were there: first time when you got to welcome madam president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Tim Walz! (Applause.) Hey, everybody. (Laughs.) We're back, and we're going to keep coming back and we're going to keep coming back. (Applause.) I want to thank -- I want to thank everybody. I want to start with Tim Walz. Isn't he fantastic? (Applause.) I like to call him Coach Walz, and, you know, he is -- he's done so much for our country, and he's going to make an extraordinary vice president of the United States. Gwen, I mean, girl, just -- you just killed it, I'm telling you. (Laughs.) I mean, you know, there's something -- I don't know -- my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson attended my law school graduation. I just love teachers. I think anyone who decides to become a teacher, it's just -- it's -- it's one of the greatest gifts that one has that they give. And I thank you, Gwen, for doing all that you have done. Thank you. (Applause.) And my husband is -- Doug, you are doing so much and you've been traveling all over our country, and I want to thank you. And you are going to, yet again, make history as the first gentleman of the United States. (Laughs.) (Applause.) There are a lot of incredible leaders here. I want to just, for a moment, mention my friend Bob Casey. (Applause.) You -- we have got to send him back to the United States Senate. For the time that I was in the United States Senate and worked with Bob -- I'm going to tell you something. You know, we had these -- we would have these meetings where all of the Democratic senators would get together for lunch, no cameras in the room. Bob, to- -- almost every time, was one of the ones who would stand up in that room with all the other senators from around the country talking about the working people of Pennsylvania and why we needed to have you in our mind when we were thinking about national policy every single day. That's who Bob Casey is. Let's send him back to the United States Senate. (Applause.) Chris Deluzio, we want to thank you. (Applause.) What he is doing in the halls of Congress -- again, I mean, you send some fighters to D.C., Pennsylvania. You sent some fighters to D.C. Your next attorney general -- DePasquale, where are you? (Applause.) I've done that work, I know what it requires, and you're going to be outstanding. So, you've got a lot of work, Pennsylvania, on your shoulders right now that you're carrying and you who are here volunteering to do this work. And it's -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we're going to get it done. (Applause.) And Malcolm Kenyatta knows exactly what I'm talking about. I see him almost every time I come into the state. So, I want to just address you all right now, as the volunteers. You know, Tim said it: This campaign for us is really born out of love of country. We all here, we love our country, and we know our country is going to be as strong as our willingness to fight for it and to fight for what we stand for. (Applause.) You know, when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. When you stand for working people, you fight for working people. When you stand for freedom, whether it be to make decisions about your own body or love who you love, you fight for those things. (Applause.) When you believe in ending child poverty, you fight for that. When you believe in what we need to do to lift up the middle class, you fight for the middle class. (Applause.) These are the things we stand for, and these, therefore, are the things we fight for. And that's what our election is about. Our election is about understanding the importance of this beautiful country of ours in terms of what we stand for around the globe as a democracy -- as a democracy. We know there's a duality to the nature of democracy. On the one hand, incredible strength when it is intact; what it does for its people to protect and defend their rights, their liberty, and their freedom -- incredibly strong. And incredibly fragile. It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And that's what this campaign is about. This campaign is about a recognition that, frankly, over the last several years, there's been this kind of perversion that has taken place, I think, which is to suggest -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down when. When what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. (Applause.) That's what we see as strength. We know what strength looks like. That's what strength looks like. (Applause.) Anybody who's about beating down other people is a coward. (Applause.) This is what strength looks like. So, we know what we are about. We know what we stand for. And one of the beautiful things about these next 79 days is what the people in this room have already been doing and know. Let's build community. Let's reinforce community. You all, as volunteers, what you know -- and we're going to spread the word -- is how you can look at the face of a perfect stranger and see in their face a neighbor; that we see in each other our connection, our interdependence -- what we see in each other -- which fortifies and reinforces that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. That's what this campaign is about. Yes, it is about winning, and we will win -- and we will win -- and we will win -- (applause) -- God willing. And through these next 79 days, we will continue to build community, build coalitions, and remind each other we are all in this together. So, I thank you all so very much for what you are doing. (Applause.) Now, let's get back to work, shall we? (Laughs.) (Applause.)","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374961",88017,"[music: Village People, YMCA.] ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump. [music: Lee Greenwood, God Bless the USA.] CROWD: USA! USA! USA! TRUMP: Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. I love Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] CROWD: USA! USA! USA! TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you. I really give a very big hello to Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] It's great to be back in this beautiful Commonwealth with thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots, which is what you are. Think of this. Who would believe this? 80 days from now, we are going to defeat a communist known as Kamala Harris, the most radical left person ever to run for office. This is not what this country needs. We've had enough of them. We're going to win back the White House and we're going to take back our country. [cheers and applause] Kamala Harris is a super-left liberal who ruined San Francisco, ruined California [booing] and delivered a badly broken economy, a badly broken border, which gave us a dangerous world of chaos, death, and destruction. Just take a look at what's happening today. We were a respected country. Now the whole world laughs at us. We're a bunch of foolish people to have allowed this to happen, but we're going to bring it back. We're going to bring it back very fast. We'll close up the borders. We'll drill, baby drill. [cheers and applause] We're going to do things that are going to be very good, very good, very fast. It'll happen very quickly, but she breaks everything that she touches. But soon we're going to fix every single problem Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, Crooked Joe have—what happened to Biden? I was running against Biden. All of a sudden I'm running against somebody else. It's true. You know, it's interesting. I said, ""Who am I running against?"" ""Harris."" I said, ""Who the hell is Harris?"" ""You don't know. Who the hell is Harris?"" [laughter] She was the first one out last time. She was the first one to lose, and now all of a sudden she's running. She never got a vote. They are a threat to democracy, remember that. Starting the day I take the Oath of Office, I will rapidly drive prices down and we will make America affordable again. [cheers and applause] We're going to make it affordable again. Under Kamala Harris and crooked Joe Biden, the American dream was dead and it is dead. It's dead as a doornail. They'll never bring it back unless we win. If we win, we're going to have the American dream alive. [cheers and applause] All for your beautiful children, your grandchildren, we'll have the American dream, will be back with us. [cheers and applause] Her radical liberal policies, of course, horrific inflation decimated the middle class and gutted the finances of millions of American families. And you know what I'm talking about because everybody in this room has been devastated by what they've done. They have no idea. They're grossly incompetent people. Real incomes are down by over $2,000 a year. Think of that. Minimum. And ours, up five times that amount, more than five times that amount. Her price hikes have cost a typical household a total of $28,000, and that's called the Kamala Harris Inflation Tax. She was there for everything. You know when she sits and complains,—hey, look, look,—Joe Biden hates her, okay, hates her. You don't mind if I go off teleprompter for a second, do you? [cheers and applause] Joe Biden hates her. This was an overthrow of a president. This was an overthrow. They went out and I spent a hundred million dollars fighting Joe Biden. They told him he couldn't win. His debate performance wasn't the best ever, [laughter] but they said mine was the best ever. But they said his debate performance wasn't. I look forward to debating her, by the way. She'll be easier, she'll be easier than him. [cheers] Her policies are so bad. Her policy, remember her father was a Marxist economic professor. He was a Marxist, an avowed Marxist. This is not what we want in this country. And think of it. Does anyone here feel richer under Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe? CROWD: NO TRUMP: Is anything less expensive under Kamala Harris or Crooked Joe? CROWD: NO TRUMP: No, no. It's been devastating. Inflation. Inflation has been devastating under this group of people that have no idea what the hell they're doing. Are you better off with Kamala and Biden than you were under President Donald J. Trump? I don't think so. They do polls and this stuff and I'm at like 93%. I said, ""Why are we having an election? They didn't have an election. Why are we having an election?"" How would you like to be Biden? He's working. He's spending money. He's trying. They wanted to have a debate. That's the thing that started it all. If I didn't debate him, he'd still be running right now. But I believe she will be easier to beat than him—[cheers and applause] because she's a truly radical left lunatic. And with him, he never really believed it. Of course, I don't know if he knew anything. I am not sure. But he didn't really believe it. She totally believes it. She wants to destroy our country. With four more years of Kamala, your finances will never recover. They will only get worse. They're only going to get worse. The stock market, and we have some of the most brilliant people on Wall Street saying the stock market is only up because they think I'm going to win and if we don't win, according to many people, including one of the greatest Wall Street prognosticators, Scott Bessent—has anyone heard of him? One of the most brilliant guys on Wall Street, if I don't win, you will have a 1929 style depression. Enjoy it. I believe that. I believe that. I believe it. A lot of people believe it, so we're not going to give them the chance, okay? We're not going to give them. And your state's going to be ruined anyway, she's totally anti-fracking. She's been anti- fracking and anti-drilling, anti-oil and gas from practically the day she was born. All of a sudden a couple of months ago, she said, ""Oh, I'd love to have fracking."" No, she won't have fracking. Vote Trump and your incomes will soar. Your savings will grow. Young people will be able to afford a home,—[cheers] and we will bring back the American dream bigger. [cheers and applause] We are going to bring it back. Bigger, better front-row Joe. Bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We're going to bring it back. Look at all these front-row Joes over here. They've only been, we have a couple of groups here. They're at about 222 events. Front-Row Joes, stand up, wave your hands, there, you guys are great. Patriots. [cheers and applause] But I have another group from a place called North Carolina. Has anybody ever heard of North? We love North Carolina. The beautiful ladies over there. This is number, what? 217, so this is number 217, and supposedly they're happily married. How the hell does that work? Look at them. [gestures towards crowd member] They're beautiful and they, oh, there's a husband. Are you a husband? Who are you married to husband? Oh, that was a wise choice. Beautiful. Very nice. How do you handle it, right? How do you handle? But they're great women and they've been with us from the very beginning. [cheers and applause] They were with us from the beginning in 2016 when we had the four greatest years this country has ever had. They were with us then. Thank you very much. North Carolina. We're doing well in North Carolina. Thank you, darling. It's nice to not have to travel to California and other places, right? Yesterday, Kamala laid out her so-called economic plan. She says she's going to lower the cost of food and housing starting on day one, but day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago so why didn't she do it then? [cheers] This is day 1,305. We're at 1,305. So why isn't she doing it now? Why doesn't she get away from her nice little place with her wonderful husband, go to Washington and do it now? You could do it right now. Why does she go to the convention? Because it's a rigged convention, obviously. She got no votes. He had 14,—you know—sleepy Joe had 14 million votes. She got no votes. She failed. She was the first one out. She failed. She never got to Iowa. Great state, Iowa. We're going to win it big. The farmers love Trump and I love the farmers, but she never got to Iowa. She was the first one to quit and now she's running for president. —I don't know—. Somebody's going to have to explain our system to our many enemies all around the world. They're watching, they're saying, ""This place doesn't make a lot of sense anymore."" Everything Kamala Harris says in her speeches is a lie. She gets up and just lies. I was watching her yesterday. She talked about all the taxes I was going to raise. I never said that. I'm lowering taxes. Yesterday she got up. She started ranting and raving that Donald Trump wants to put a tax on gasoline, a tax on food, a tax on medication, a tax on clothing, a tax on every single thing that was ever invented. Your hat, he's going to tax. Your shirt, he is going to tax. He's going to tax your wife; he's going to tax your husband. And I'm saying, I never said any of that. They make it up. Here's the truth. Kamala wants to put massive taxes on American jobs and American industries. I want to cut taxes on Americans while putting tariffs on China and foreign countries to bring our jobs back home to Pennsylvania and to take in billions and billions of dollars. [cheers and applause] I'm the only one that ever took in any money from China. China was really hitting us hard, ripping us apart, that means many, many presidents. And what happened is I put a tariff on then I raised the tariff. We took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China and—Biden gets so much money; he's trying to rescind it for a couple of reasons. Number one, he got a lot of money from China. Didn't he get three and a half million, 4 million that they know of? But he got a lot more than that. His family made a lot of money with China. He wants to get rid of the tariff, but he can't because there's so much money they can't do anything with the budget. A tariff is a tax on a foreign country. That's the way it is, whether you like it or not. A lot of people like to say it's a tax on us. No, no, no. It's a tax on a foreign country. It's a tax on a country that's ripping us off and stealing our jobs and it's a tax that doesn't affect our country. [cheers] And you could see hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs on other countries also. I took in hundreds of billions and nothing happened to us. They make less money. And you know what? Our jobs come back because there's no tax if they build their factory in Pennsylvania, there's no tax if they build their factory in the United States. So what do they do in order to avoid paying the tax? They say, ""Let's build a place over here. No tax."" Come on over. We love it. Just hire our people. That's all you have to do. It's very simple. As we speak, and this really goes to Michigan more than you, but I look at Michigan and South Carolina, a lot of other places that do the auto stuff, and they are building some of the biggest auto factories in the world right now in Mexico, right off our border. They think they're going to make cars, not pay any tax and sell those cars into the United States. Not going to happen. Not with me. They're building some of the biggest auto plants in the world. And you know who owns those auto plants? They're built. They're made and being built in Mexico. You know who owns them? China owns them. China's very smart. I had a good relationship with President Xi. When Covid came, that was the end of that relationship. But I had a very good relationship. But we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. Think of it, Bush, Barack Hussein—did you ever hear of Barack Hussein Obama? [booing] Have you heard of her? [booing] There are those that think he is currently running the country. Does anybody think? [booing] I don't know. I don't know that that's true. We know it's not Biden. Every attack Kamala makes on us is a fabricated, it's a lie. She's a bad storyteller. She doesn't know how to tell a story very well, but she gets caught, she got caught up in her own words. She's not a very good wordsmith they say. I don't know. We're going to find out. We're going to have a debate at some point. They gave me—the worst network to me is ABC, worse than NBC, worse than CBS, worse than CNN. The home of George Stephanopoulos, —a nasty guy. I said, ""George, I've had you up to here."" It's true. He's a nasty guy. The hatred. And yet when he interviews Biden, two weeks ago, he interviewed Biden, it was like the nicest interview. ""What flavor ice cream do you like?"" ""George, I tend to vanilla very much."" [laughter] With me they get into a lot of subjects that a lot of people don't like talking about. But ABC is the worst. And that seems because they won't do it on Fox. They've turned down the Fox. I've approved three debates. They've approved one. The only one they've approved was their network. And now it came out in the New York Times of all places that the head of the news and the head of the whole thing practically is Kamala and her husband, lovely husband, best friend, her and her husband are best friends with Kamala and her husband. And I'm supposed to do the debate. But with Biden, they thought I wouldn't do it so they offered me something that I couldn't accept. They said, ""The debate is at CNN in front of no audience."" So far, I'm oh for two. And see, they didn't want to do the debate. That would've been a good idea if they didn't do it, but I was going to accept anything. Then I guess we'll do it here too, right? We'll accept anything because otherwise she's not going to debate. She doesn't want to debate, but they said, ""CNN and no audience, and we want to have you sit down."" I objected to that. They wanted us sitting behind the desk. I said, ""Give me a break. We have to at least stand for the American public."" Wouldn't that be nice? [cheers and applause] That was the only thing, and I would've done it if they insisted. No, I would've sat down if they insisted. But I thought it was sort of a little strange. But I had Dana Bash and I had Jake Tapper. But I have to tell you, they were very fair. I really thought they were very fair. Jake and Dana, nobody knows how to say her first name. Is it Dana or Dana? Nobody knows. It's been going on for 20 years. She's been around a long time. Is it Dana or Dana? And now the fake news will say, ""Trump didn't know how to pronounce her first name."" She doesn't know how to pronounce, but look, but Dana and Jake, I used to call him Fake Tapper. Now I call him Jake Tapper because he treated us very fairly and so did Dana treat me very fairly. I think it was just about neutral. But he kept saying—he gave very short answers because he wasn't really doing too well. And I kept saying, ""I'll take it."" But what happened? ""Sir, you have 92 seconds left."" This is not what he wanted to hear. [gestures to David McCormick] Right, David? They said, ""You have 92 seconds left,"" going to be your next senator I'll tell you, David McCormick. [cheers and applause] I hope you can vote for him. I hope you vote for him. I hope you vote for him. He is a great gentleman, great hero actually in many ways. He's a great guy. But so they gave me this thing and they assumed I was going to turn it down so I have the wrong network. I have the wrong anchors. I have no audience. I like an audience. I love people. [cheers and applause] It's oftentimes a mistake. Everything was wrong. So what we'll do is we'll offer him this thing that he can't accept. He won't accept it. And then we'll say, ""Trump didn't accept the debate. He's afraid to negotiate against Biden because Biden is so sharp. He's so sharp. He's sharp like a razor."" But I surprised them. I said, ""I'll take it. I'll take it."" And people said, ""Are you crazy?"" I said, ""Look, it's the only way you're going to debate. If we do anything else, they're not going to accept it."" And these people are the same way. They offered me – we, we were supposed to have Fox on September 4th. And they said, ""No."" I accepted it. I don't even know what's going to happen because I've accepted it. They haven't. So maybe they show up, maybe they don't. But I think it's sort of on for September 4th, but I don't think they're going to come. And then we go and we do the debate with ABC. ABC, again, I call it ABC Fake News, so bad. They're so bad. They're so dishonest, in my opinion. Very dishonest people. But I find them to be the worst. And I really am a professional at this because I watch the—who treats me the worst? Now, NBC is horrible. CBS is horrible. They're all horrible. These are horrible human beings. But who treats me the worst? ABC Fake News treats me the worst. And that's where they want it. Where her best friend—it just came out the other day. Nobody told anybody about this, is the head of the whole deal, right? But I'll probably say, ""I'll take it"" because you know what they're not going to do a debate? But just remember, these are phony, fake, disgusting people that hate our country. [cheers] Remember that. And also remember that every attack that we make on Kamala is something that she said on tape or something that she's actually done. All of these attacks are things because she said all of it. She said, ""I don't want fracking in Pennsylvania."" She said it hundreds of times. ""I don't want it anywhere,"" then a couple of months ago, when the polls are showing that she's getting clobbered, well actually, nobody actually thought they were politically correct. They wanted to be politically correct because they wanted, they had 11 different people and they put her name in to be number 12, and they had a vote. She came in last. So she picked somebody, think of it, how about the guy she picked, how bad is he, right? How bad is that guy? David, where do these people come from? [cheers and applause] He recently signed a bill in a state that I love, but a state that hasn't been won by a Republican because it's a corrupt state, but the people are not corrupt. The people are great. Since 1972 hasn't been won. And I thought we won it twice, I said, ""There's no way we lose Minnesota."" But he signed a bill for all young men's bathrooms and men's bathrooms, have to be equipped with a tampon-selling machine. [booing] And she turned down, your governor, by the way, just so you understand, I know some of you probably like him. [booing] I don't think he's a good person. I don't think he's good. I don't think he's good. But they turned him down because he's Jewish. Okay. That's why they turned him down. Now we can be politically correct and not say that. I could say, ""Well, they turned him down for various reasons."" No, no. They turned him down because he's Jewish, that's why they turned him down. And I'll tell you this, any Jewish person that votes for her or a Democrat has to go out and have their head examined because if you see what's happening with Israel and Jewish people right now, there has never been a more dangerous time since the Holocaust. If you happen to be Jewish in America, there's never been anything like it. I'm seeing things, I can't even believe it, and we want to bring about unity and peace and everything else. It looks like they're going to have nothing but riots out there in Chicago. It's really a sad thing. But they turned him down for that reason and they turned him down for a couple of other reasons too. But the primary reason was that he's Jewish. And you don't think I know what goes on in their campaign. I know it well. I know it very well. She's a nation-wrecker who is more liberal than crazy Bernie Sanders. You know Crazy Bernie. He's pretty bad, right? She is substantially more radicalized than Crazy Bernie. You cannot have her as your president. She ruined San Francisco. She ruined the state of California. No, she was a district attorney, and she was the attorney general of the state. I heard the other day, and this isn't anything, I'm just saying—they'll say, ""He was rambling."" I don't ramble. I'm really smart guy, really smart. I don't ramble. But the other day, anytime I hit too hard, they say he was rambling. Rambling? I get up and I make a speech. I go for sometimes two hours, two and a half hours, because people are waiting outside for three days, four days. You guys were waiting out there for a long time. Front row Joes are waiting out—I don't know how you guys do it. And I feel I have an obligation to speak, and speak in a certain way, and speak a little bit longer. You know? How would you like it? A guy's waiting with his family for three and a half, four days. They have a tent, and the tent is set up. They have hundreds of them, and they wait. And then I walk in, speak for 15 minutes, and leave. I don't know, somehow, would that be okay, North Carolina? I don't think so, right? CROWD: NO TRUMP: They want me to speak all day. When I leave, I did one, two hours and 15 minutes, and I'm leaving, and they're screaming, ""No, sir, more! We want to hear more!"" I said, ""I can't!"" I said, ""I can't speak more! What the hell else am I going to say? Our country's going to hell. That's all I can say. We're a nation in decline."" You know we were talking about that before. My phrases are copied so much, right? I use the term, oftentimes in closing, ""We are a nation in decline. We are a failed nation."" And I think it's a beautiful phrase, although I don't like the topic very much, I don't like what it represents, but there's a certain beauty. All of a sudden, all of these candidates, including Republicans, are saying, ""We are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation."" And I say, You know, what the hell do they have to copy me for? Right? But they have a lot of words that they copy, many of our words. We were in the plane before coming in, and our people said—we went through a list. I think we're going to release a list. Let's release it. But so many of our phrases, they copy. Really, that should be a nice thing. Not an insult. But crazy Bernie Sanders has said a lot of things, and one of the things he's arguing about is who's more liberal. And after about two minutes, he gave up. He said, ""This woman is nuts."" Look, people say be nice. Have you heard her laugh? That is the laugh of a crazy person. That is the laugh of a crazy. It's the laugh of a lunatic. [cheers and applause] Have you heard it? You know, they prohibited her. They prohibited her for laughing. I've been waiting for her to laugh, because as soon as she laughs, the election's over. But we're winning by a lot in Pennsylvania. I think the fracking got her. [cheers and applause] The fracking got her. But she has been prohibited from laughing. She used to do an interview, she'd go ha-ha-ha. Who the hell laughs at an interview like that? I'm interviewed all the time, I may smile. They're asking you questions about things that—It's not like a comedy club. And she'd break out. That's one of the reasons she refuses to do interviews, I think, because she laughs, it's so horrible. No, it's so horrible. But you know she hasn't done an interview in 30 days or something like that? And I do one every day. If I pass—I just did one backstage. [cheers and applause] I just did one backstage with a very good reporter. But you're supposed to. Don't you sort of have an obligation? You know you're running. They're going to try. This is her form of the basement. Now, the basement for him was good because they had COVID, they didn't want him to catch COVID, he ended up catching it anyway. But uh the whole system is very dishonest, but she should be at least talking to the press. She hasn't done anything. But she's prohibited from laughing. They said, ""Your laugh is horrible. Never laugh, ever."" So, she's walking around with her mouth almost sealed shut. She won't laugh. I want her to laugh! And then we'll just claim victory. Ladies and gentlemen, like to thank you very much. But we have a little video that we just put up. Would you like to see it? CROWD: YES TRUMP: Go ahead. Just one. KAMALA HARRIS [montage of clips from Harris's statements]: Yeah, I am a radical. You need to get radical about what we're doing, and take it seriously. As president of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal. There's no question, I'm in favor of banning fracking. We have to have a buyback program, and I support a mandatory buyback program. JAKE TAPPER: I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance. HARRIS: Let's eliminate all of that. ERIN BURNETT: But would you support changing the dietary guidelines? HARRIS: Yes. BURNETT: You know, the food pyramid? HARRIS: Yes. BURNETT: To reduce red meat specifically? HARRIS: Yes, I would. INTERVIEWER 1: Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants. EBRO DARDEN: Where do you stand on defund the police? HARRIS: This whole movement is about rightly saying we need to take a look at these budgets. UNNAMED COMMENTATOR 1: Harris asserted that ICE is perceived as the modern day Ku Klux Klan. HARRIS: Are you aware that there's a perception- UNNAMED SPEAKER 1: I see no- HARRIS: Are you aware that there's a perception— SPEAKER 1: —perception that puts ICE in the same category as the KKK. Is that where you're asking me? I see no parallel. HARRIS: I'm not finished. SPEAKER 1: I see none. HARRIS: Maybe I am a radical. We need to get radical about what we are doing. CROWD: BOO TRUMP: Now, over the years, and right up until the present, she wanted to openly defund the police. How do you like that? CROWD: BOO TRUMP: In Minnesota, when they were burning down the state, and in particular Minneapolis, they were burning it down. Remember the CNN fake reporter? He got up—the one with the nice, shaved head, he got up. ""This is a peaceful rally. This is a rally of love."" Behind him, the entire city was burning. It looked like World War II, right? And by the way, speaking of World War II, she will bring us into World War III, and it will be—that'll be a war like never before, because of the weaponry. No more army tanks going back and forth shooting. We've left a lot of our – you know, I rebuilt the entire military, and we left a lot of that in a place called Afghanistan. You know that? Billions and billions of dollars, we left it. In the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, we left billions of dollars. 13 great soldiers killed. Think of it. Left many hostages. Many people have been left behind. But think of what happened there. We got out in disgrace. We should have gotten out with strength. I was getting out. We would've been out even sooner, but strength, dignity, we would've kept Bagram. The big air base. You know who occupies Bagram right now? China. Because it was one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. Not because of Afghanistan, but because of China. But China occupies it right now. Thank you very much, President Xi, enjoy our billions of dollars of construction that took place years ago. They spent billions of dollars many years ago. One hour away, think of that, where they make their nuclear weapons. It's so embarrassing, the stupidity of the people that have run our country. But we did things the opposite way. We were very smart, we were very respected, we were a respected country. They respected your leader, elected leader. But remember this. Viktor Orban of Hungary, prime minister of Hungary, they asked him pretty recently, they said, ""What's going on? The world is coming to an end."" He said, ""If you want to stop it, reelect—the United States, reelect Donald Trump. [cheers and applause] Because when he was there, he didn't have any problems. We didn't have problems."" Russia wouldn't have happened with Ukraine. Israel would've never been attacked on October 7th, never. You know Iran was broke? Iran was broke. They had no money. I told China, ""You buy oil from them, you can't deal with us."" I told that to many countries, anybody that dealt there, so they didn't buy oil. Oil's the whole thing, the big deal. And they were broke. Now they have $3 billion, think of it. They have $300 billion now, they have plenty of money. We're run by stupid people, and we have to change it, or we're not going to have a country left. We didn't let countries take advantage of us. France was going to charge our corporations tremendous amounts of money for doing business in France. You know this, David. David is very familiar with what happened. And I went to my people. I said, ""Tell them we're not going to put up with it. They're not going to charge our companies, because we want our companies to do well so they can employ people."" It's sort of simple. I didn't even like a lot of the companies that they were dealing with. I should have said, ""Oh, great, let them charge. What the hell do I care?"" But they're American companies. And I said to Macron, I said, ""Call him, because my people failed to make a deal."" I said, ""You make a deal, you have one week. Come see me."" At the end of a week, they came to see me. Good people, smart people, very smart people. Secretary of Treasury, smart guy, Mnuchin, others. They came back to see me. ""Sir, we're not able to make a deal. They're going to charge our companies a tax."" I said, ""No, no, they're not going to do it. You don't understand. They're not going to do it. Come back and see me. You have one more day."" They came back, ""Sir, they won't do it. They've already passed it in their so-called legislature. We're not going to do it. They're not going to be able to stop it, sir."" I said, ""We'll stop it. Get Emmanuel Macron on the phone."" I got him on the phone. ""Emmanuel, how are you? So nice to talk."" ""Oh, Donald, Donald, it is so nice to speak to you."" It's beautiful. I wish"," I had his accent; I would've been president 20 years ago. But I said, ""Emmanuel, I understand you're charging our companies a lot of money?"" ""Oh, well, this has been in the works for many years, you know Donald. Yes, it is done, it is really done. There's nothing we can do about it."" I said, ""Okay, good. Emmanuel, here's the story. If you don't get rid of that tax within 24 hours, starting on Monday morning,"" it was a Friday, ""I'm going to charge every bottle of wine and champagne that you send into our country. I'm going to charge you a tariff of 100% on every bottle, and you will not be sending too many bottles of champagne."" [cheers and applause] And he said, ""Donald, Donald, that is not fair. That is not fair."" I said, ""No, no. It's not fair for you to be charging American companies to do business in your country. No, it's not fair, Emmanuel. Emmanuel, get back to me in five minutes and let me know."" He called me back in two minutes. He said, ""Donald, we have decided that we will not be charging you any taxes for the American companies."" [cheers and applause] I did so many of them. I did so many. I could stand up here all day and tell you different stories. I just used the telephone. I could stop the war with a telephone. I could stop what's happening in the Middle East with a couple of telephone calls, properly placed. [cheers and applause] Horrible. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We have people that are babies. In many ways, I guess they're stupid. People say, ""Please don't use bad language! Please don't call people stupid!"" They're stupid people. How else do you describe it? I want to use a different word, highly—a more sophisticated word than stupid, but there's no word. It's a perfect word. They're stupid people. I think they're also, by the way, if I might, they're also corrupt. They really are, they're corrupt. They get a lot of money from a lot of people. We're not going to let this socialist lunatic—and she's a socialist lunatic. That's the other thing. ""Please, sir. Please don't call her a lunatic."" I said, ""But that's what she is."" She's a lunatic. [cheers and applause] She's a lunatic. She's going to destroy our country. And she's going to break our economy even more than it's broken. We have a broken economy. Our supply chain is gone. You order something now, I don't know how many of you are in business, or even if you're ordering as a personal order, the order doesn't come. The supply chain is broken. Whoever thought of it, we never even talked about supply chain. Supply chain just worked. And because of what they've done, they've broken our supply chain. On election day, we're going to tell her that we've had enough. We said, ""Kamala, you're a horrible vice president, you're going to be a horrible president. We're not going to take it anymore. KAMALA, you're fired! Get out of there! You're fired!"" [cheers and applause] Not going to take it anymore, Kamala. [cheers and applause] CROWD: USA! USA! USA! TRUMP: We're not going to take it anymore. We have a country to save. And how about the fake news? [gestures towards media] Oh, look at them all back here, look at all those cameras. [booing] TRUMP: Look at all those cameras. Wow. Look at all those cameras, all those fake writers. Look at them. [booing] Time Magazine, think of this. Time Magazine doesn't have a picture of her. They have this unbelievable artist drawing her. And I said, ""Is that Sophia Loren?"" I couldn't—who might that be? Is that Elizabeth Taylor? They say she was a beautiful woman. Who is it? It's so beautiful. Drawing. It's a drawing. They took a lot of pictures, it didn't work out, so they hired a sketch artist. I said, ""I'm sure, oh, they must be celebrating the great life and times of the magnificently beautiful Sophia Loren."" And you're not allowed to say this anymore. You know, David, don't ever get caught in this trap, David, please. Don't ever call a woman beautiful, because that'll be the end of your political career. Please. I want to make your life much easier, David. By the way, he's also got a great wife, I have to say, he's got a great wife. [applause] But you know, I read a so-called Republican, who Ronald Reagan didn't like, by the way, and she didn't like him, but she got credit for being this Reagan speech writer. Highly overrated. I don't know anything about her, I don't know her. Treats me badly, but that's okay. She called it wrong. She's called it wrong now for about eight years. But she said one thing that got me. She said Kamala has one big advantage. She's a very beautiful woman. [laughter] CROWD: BOO TRUMP: She's a beautiful woman. So, I decided to go back and reread the clause. ""I'm not saying he's —"" but I say that I am much better looking than her. [cheers and applause] I think I'm much better, much better. I'm a better looking person than Kamala! No, I couldn't believe it. I had never heard that one. They said, ""No, her biggest advantage is that she's a beautiful woman."" I'm going, ""Huh."" I never thought of that. I'm better looking than she is. [cheers] In her speech yesterday, Kamala went full communist. You heard that? She went full communist. She wants to destroy our country. After causing catastrophic inflation, Comrade Kamala announced that she wants to institute socialist price controls. You saw that? Never worked before. Never ever worked. This is the Maduro plan. Venezuela Maduro plan of the old Soviet Union. They tried it. How did the Soviet Union work out? It became Russia, smaller version. It was a smaller version. It will cause rationing, hunger, and skyrocketing prices, just like their Inflation Reduction Act caused. One of the great scams of all time. They got it approved with a beautiful name: Inflation Reduction. Because inflation, under their system, has been so bad. It's gone up much more than 50%. They say, ""30, 40, 50."" Much more. People are being devastated. They're being devastated. But it's gone way up, way up. And they made a big mistake yesterday in her speech. I think she said, I had to play it back. I love the playback controls you have nowadays. They used to call it TiVo, now they have TiVo, all the—I think it's the single greatest invention. It's better than television, because television would drive you crazy if you couldn't do a playback, right? Now I can playback. I heard the statement, and I heard that statement that she made, and she made a statement yesterday that, from her time in office, essentially, prices have gone up by 50%, something like—I said, ""Did she just say that?"" I said, ""That speech writer is going to be fired."" In fact, we took that section and we actually made a commercial on it, and we got the best commercial of the week, and we didn't do anything. We just played her back. But here's the problem. The things that she said yesterday don't work. They have never worked. They've never been used. Many times before, in many other countries, they've never worked. They've just never worked. They've been used oftentimes, many countries, and in every single event, it ruined those countries. It's a communist system. It's what her father, a Marxist, he was a Marxist, it's what her father taught her, from a young girl growing up. She's promising to hand out things she can't deliver. She can never deliver them; she'll never get them approved. Just like when she and Crooked Joe tried to give away student debt. Remember? She wanted to pay. How did that work out? Not too good. The students are saying, ""I love him because of student debt."" But he got rejected. And this will be rejected even more so because what they're doing is a communist takeover of our country. Her plan is very dangerous, because it may sound good politically, and that's the problem. And we have to be very careful, because when somebody gets up and says, ""We're going to give you everything: $25,000 for a house, we're going to give you all sorts of little goodies, free healthcare, we're going to give you everything, universal healthcare."" Sounds so beautiful. And I told my people, you got to be very careful. I told the Republican Party; you have to be very careful. She's giving all this away, and somebody that really isn't into it. We're largely, even groups like this, we're into it. We think about it all the time. We want to take back our country. We want to save our country. And you understand how bad this stuff is? This is communist, this is Marxist, this is fascist. But you know what? It's dangerous because she's saying that she's going to give away things that she'll never be able to get approved. She wants to increase the number of justices on the United States Supreme Court to 27. 27.[booing] I used to hear she was going up to 11, and then I heard it was 13. But then they said that's an unlucky number, so they went to 15. Yesterday for the first time, I heard 27. We'll have to rebuild the entire Supreme Court, because they won't have enough room for the judges. They won't have enough—. And by the way, how courageous were our justices of the United States Supreme Court? [cheers and applause] What they did, they're saving our country. They're actually saving our country. What they've done is they've passed things that were so important, and they did it for the right, not for the wrong. They did the right thing. They did the right thing. And I just have such respect for them. The job they've done against—and the radical left plays the ref. You know the great Bobby Knight? He supported me. He used to fight with the referees all the time. Scream at them. ""Bobby, Bobby, please don't do that. It's not going to work."" He said, ""You're right, it's not going to work now; it's going to work for the next one."" And the next call, there'd be a flagrant foul and they wouldn't call it. They didn't want to get screamed at. The radical left harasses our judges, and harasses our justices. They scream at them. They call them names. They say they're incompetent. They're horrible. They're this, they're that. They should be impeached. They're constantly saying they should be impeached. But they're screaming. And you know what? It has an effect on some people. But so far, they've been very strong. It's really horrible. I believe it's illegal, what they do. And I'm trying to give you things that you've never heard before, and this is true. I believe they are playing the ref. They're constantly criticizing our great, some of our greatest, justices, and a lot of great judges. I kept hearing so much about the Florida case, because you know they weaponized our system. Our government totally weaponized it. First time it's ever happened. And they said my biggest case is in Florida, Florida, Florida. We had a very brilliant, I don't know the judge, but a fair and very brilliant judge, who took tremendous abuse. Would've been so easy for her to just rule against me. But she didn't do that. She ruled for—threw out the whole case. [cheers and applause] It was thrown out. That was a big case. And I have such respect for her because she is, in fact, brilliant. But they were hitting her so hard. ""She's going too slow. She's not, she should be removed immediately from office."" These people are horrible. I really think it's illegal, what they do with judges and justices. They're playing the ref. No different than Bobby Knight. And he was great. He endorsed me, and Indiana was mine, he was a great coach. He's the last coach to go undefeated. I guess he was like 38—. For some reason, they've never had another college team since then. That was many years ago. And he came out in favor of Donald Trump, and it was a big thing. I won Indiana by a landslide. Because when Bobby Knight from Indiana endorses you, you win. [cheers] Sort of like when I endorse you, you win too. We have a very good record of endorsement. But we can't let these radical left thugs constantly scream at our judges and say, ""We're going to impeach him. We're going to take him out of office."" Or her. ""We're going to do horrible things to him."" Continuous. When you heard Schumer get up on the stairs of the courthouse, Supreme Court, and talk about Kavanaugh, ""We're going to get you, Kavanaugh. We're going to hit you."" Or whatever the hell he said. If a mobster said that, they'd be put in jail immediately. He frankly should have been put in jail, or certainly spoken to very strongly. [cheers and applause] He got lucky. He got lucky. He had a couple of guys that didn't want to do it, and I understand that also. But he got lucky. But we can't let them do that. And I just want to pay my respect to the judges that have suffered abuse at the hands of the radical left lunatics. And I really admire them for—because you know what? All they have to do to end it is rule against me or whatever it is. If they say, ""Trump, you're guilty."" Oh, now all of a sudden they say, ""Oh."" That's the last time they ever say a bad—but they can't do it, because these people have weaponized the Justice Department, including local DAs and local attorney generals. And Fani, Fani. You know Fani? Spelled F-A-N-I. ""My name is Fani, F-A-N-I."" I don't figure it. She put a little French accent on the word with her lover, Wade. Right? Lover Wade, we call him, Lover Boy Wade. She hired and paid him almost a million dollars because of his great knowledge of the law. He never did it before. With us today is Daniel Campos, a pilot in Venezuela who now lives in Pennsylvania. Great gentleman. Daniel came to tell us what you think of Kamala Harris leading our country into socialism. We're being led into socialism, but the socialism will be short-lived. It's going into communism. If you would've told me, and if you remember many times during State of the Unions, I would say, ""We will never have a socialist country."" And everybody would applaud. But I was right because we're really, I think, skipping socialism. We're going into communism. When they weaponize our government like this, that's what they do in Third World countries. That's what they do in South American horror shows. That's what they do in banana republics. They've weaponized it. But I believe ours is even more corrupt. The New York court system is totally corrupt. They use the state and the city to go after me. They take top people in the Department of Justice and put them in. The Attorney General Leticia James, she campaigned, and, ""I will get Trump!"" And they then go there, and then they go into the Manhattan DA's office. They use Hillary Clinton's lawyer and the Democrats' law firm to leave the firm and go into the DA's office in order to prosecute Donald Trump, free of charge. They're not going to charge. Then he writes a book, this guy writes a book, before the thing even went anywhere. And in the book he said, ""I do it for free, it's so great."" These are corrupt people, and we have to call them out. So, remember the term, playing the ref with our judges and our justices should be punishable by very serious fines and beyond that. [cheers and applause] But I'd like to ask, because—because we're into that whole system. And I'd like to call up Daniel. Please come up and tell us about your experience in living in a country that went very, very bad, went radical left, and the experience has not been good. Please come up. Thank you. Hi, Daniel. [cheers and applause] DANIEL CAMPOS: Thank you. I'm so pleased to meet you. TRUMP: How are you? Appreciate it. Nice to see you. Please. CAMPOS: Okay. All right. First of all, hi, everybody. Thank you for coming here and supporting the president. [cheers and applause] I'm going to say the first part of the speech, well, of my story, in English, then I'm going to repeat it in Spanish in order to allow our Latino voters to understand and hear what the situation is going on. [cheers and applause] First of all, as the president already said, I'm from Venezuela. I left the country in 2007 because of communism. I still have family there. There's been family that has left even before me, or continues leaving little by little. But going farther back, my grandparents from my mom's side were from Cuba. They were at university when the communist revolution was going on, and they ended up leaving to Venezuela. They only have the money they received for as their wedding present, and they were living in a mid-house, going to school, and trying to move, you know, ahead. My granddad ended up becoming a doctor, and had a family, raising three children, my mom and my two uncles, when, in the early 1990s, Chavez did a military coup. And right after he run for president, my granddad saw the similarities to what was happening in Cuba, and he told everybody that would listen to him that it was coming. And everybody was like, ""No, this is Venezuela. This is not Cuba. This will never happen to us."" And guess what? It happened to us and has been happening to other Latin American countries as well. TRUMP: [points down] Right here. CAMPOS: So when they tell you here, it will never happen, that's not true. We lived it. Now here we are. So, in 2007, we ended up leaving because the socialists and the government, they start changing the education system to make it more like the Cuban education system. It might ring a bell to what's going on here as well. So, it's extremely important for everybody to keep this in mind. And if you don't mind, I'm going to switch to Spanish for our Latino speakers. [cheers and applause] TRUMP: Yeah, good job. CAMPOS: Thank you. Para todos latinomericanos, gracias por venir aquí, soportar Presidente Trump. Es importante que entendamos que lo que ha pasado en otro países en Latinoamerica puede pasar aquí. Como mencioné, mi abuela—mi abuelos son de Cuba. Se fueron por el comunismo, llegaron a Venezuela sin ninguna base, solo un poco dinero salieron adelante y se—mi abuelo se convirtió en doctor y crió mi madre y mis dos tios. Cuando Chavez hizo el atentado—perdón—el golpe de estado y duespués corrió por president. Mi abuelo trató de advertir al todo el mundo que eso es exactamente como Cuba. Nadie le hizo cazo. ¿Que paso? Chavez entró y veinte años duespués, aqui estamos. Tiene que recordar, que si paso en un lugar, puede pasar aquí también. No crean que porque Estados Unidos, gran economia, no puede pasar. Puede pasar y vamos encaminados al menos que tomemos un paso differente y yo por esto pienso que Trump es la major persona para ser lo. Going back in English, that we are going on a path that is taking us to what Venezuela became, and the only way right now that we can avoid keep going down that path is making Trump president again. [cheers and applause] Thank you. It's a pleasure. [cheers and applause] TRUMP: Have you done that before? CAMPOS: No. TRUMP: Oh, wow. Thank you, Daniel. CROWD: USA! USA! USA! USA! TRUMP: Great. CROWD: USA! USA! USA! USA! TRUMP: What a fantastic job. I said, ""Have you done that before?"" He said, ""No, sir."" You are something. [cheers and applause] All right. What office is he going to run for? I think we're going to endorse him so fast. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much. No, it's such a problem because it's a very dangerous situation. She's giving everybody free everything. It's never going to happen. Remember the college debt, the student debt they were going to give? It never happened. It was just all talk. Then he said, after getting totally rejected—he came up with another plan, which is even dumber. But what happens is they talk. These things will never happen, but it's very dangerous because politically maybe somebody says, ""Oh, that's great. That's great."" It's the end of our country. We can't do it. We can't do it. So, I really appreciate that. That was beautiful. That was so well done. Amazing. Thank you. [cheers and applause] In addition to defeating Kamala Harris, you need to defeat your terrible Democrat Senator Bob Casey. [booing] You know I've been there, I've been in Washington for a long time. I mean, I barely met the guy. Most of these guys I get to meet in one form or another, for better or worse. I hardly know this guy. I never really remember meeting him. He obviously created a great impression. But he's not a hard worker. He's cruising on his father's past. I met the father. I think I knew the father better than I knew the son. But Bob Casey voted for every bill that caused the worst inflation in the history of our country, in my opinion. They call it decades, but I believe it's the history of our country because they're not using the real things. Like, mortgage rates went from 2% to 10%. They don't say that. That's inflation. They don't say that. And you can't get any money at 10% either. We had it down to two and 2.4, 2.5%, and now you can't get the money at 10%. They don't have any money. He voted to open borders and the war on Pennsylvania energy. You know, Bob Casey voted against all of this stuff, against your state, but you don't know because you have other jobs. You're not watching Bob Casey. That's why you need to fire Bob Casey, and you have to elect a man named David McCormick for the U.S. Senate. Dave is strong on borders, great on taxes. He wants to reduce your taxes. All my life, I've been involved, usually from the other side, it's called writing checks, but I've been involved. I've made lots of contributions to politicians all my life. And politicians always talked about, ""We will lower your taxes."" That's all they talked about is lowering tax. This is the only group I've ever seen where they say, ""We are going to increase your taxes."" I've never heard of it before. And by four times. I gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and bigger than the Reagan tax cuts. And they expire in a few months, and they want to not renew them. If that's the case, you're going to pay four times the tax that you're paying right now. And then they, on top of that, want to increase your taxes to pay for the green new scam. You know what the green new scam is? CROWD MEMBER: YEAH TRUMP: The oceans will rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years, but they don't talk about a madman that's building nuclear missiles right now. That's your real global warming. It's not this. Your global warming is war. Your global warming is going to be nuclear weapons. Nobody talks about that. They don't ever mention it, but they talk about an ocean that's rising, which will give you slightly more beachfront property if it happens. Now, think of it. But they don't talk about somebody that's got very evil intentions. Look at Iran. I stopped them from building a nuclear weapon, but this guy is going to give it up. [cheers and applause] He's going to give it up. So, David McCormick. And I've known him for a long time, he's an amazing man, a tremendous education, tremendous military background, and he's a very strong guy, and he loves the state. I really hope you give him a chance. It's not easy. And I was just talking to him. A guy's been in office for years. He's done nothing. He's done nothing. In that way, it's good, but in another way, it's tough because you've seen his name a little bit. You don't even see his name. Most people don't even know. If you asked, ""Who are the senators?"" they may choose the one that didn't do so well in a debate but won, right? He didn't do too well in a debate. I wonder who did worse in the debate, Biden or him? I think maybe Biden did. I think, actually— CROWD MEMBER: Fuck Joe Biden! TRUMP: he's made more sense than a lot of other people over the last few months, in all fairness. He actually has. I commend him on that. But nobody knows about Casey. Nobody knows about him, even though he's been there for years. His father was there for years. I just want to ask. It's very important because we want to turn our country around. We need to get great representation even beyond the presidency. And this is a dead seat. It's a seat that voted with this group of people, Barack Hussein Obama, and Biden, and her, because she was a part of it. She's now trying to claim that she has nothing to do with Biden. She had nothing to do with the administration. They put him on. Now, maybe they change it, because I said this a couple of days ago. Usually, when I say something, they immediately change it so I can't say it anymore, but they gave him speaking on Monday night. Now, have they changed it? I don't think so. Monday night is considered, on a convention, Death Valley. It's Death Valley, because people aren't watching Monday night. So, they deposed a president. It was a coup of a president. This was a coup. Nancy Pelosi, Crazy Nancy, she's crazy as a bed bug, Crazy Nancy went in and laid it out. And she never thought he was good, because she's smart, cunning, nasty, mean, but she's crazy. And she went in and she said, ""You're getting out."" And he said, ""No, I'm not. Only God will get me out."" Right? Isn't that what he said? ""Only God."" And within about 24 hours, he announced that he was going to get out. And he won it. He went through a primary system. She didn't. He beat her in the primary. She ran along with 22 people. She ran. She was the first one out because she was no good. She was no good. And now she's running. And this is not what our country's all about. And he feels terrible, and he's a very angry man. I watched him yesterday. He's a very angry man. I think he hates them more than he hates Donald Trump, and that's hard to believe. I really do. He's an angry man, and he should be an angry man. They walked in and they stole the presidency of the United States from him. Now, I think he was a terrible president. I think he was the worst president in the history of our country. I think that Jimmy Carter is the happiest man on Earth today. He's not a young man. Because Jimmy Carter's presidency was brilliant, brilliant by comparison to this. But she was a big part of it, and she's going to be an even bigger part. Now she wants to give her a whole country away. And just as Daniel and others have said, I mean, its, its—our country's going to die, and yet it's scary because she's given so much away. I mean, who's not going to vote to get some money for House? It's never going to happen. It's trillions of dollars. It's never going to happen. But who's going to vote? I mean, people will maybe vote for this. I said before, it may be good politics, but it's going to destroy our country. The Washington Post, one of the most evil print journalism, I mean, they've lost a lot of people over the last couple of years, it's nasty, they came out with an editorial excoriating her. Actually, I spoke with Jeff Bezos just for almost the first time. I met him once before. And he was so complimentary on the way we handled the horrible situation that took place recently, and I appreciated that. But we talked a little bit about the paper. And their radical left paper, they excoriated her in today's editorial. Excoriated her. And I give The Washington Post tremendous credit. I believe The New York Times did, or is about to do, the same thing. But when they're going after somebody because they're far, far—it's not even left. Every single country that's done this—it's been done many times because it's so easy to say, ""I'm going to give you this. I'm going to give you that. We're going to put price controls on food."" How do they do that? We're going to say, ""The beans are going to cost this. Cereal's going to—"" It doesn't work. And what happens is you end up with huge inflation and no product because you can't make it anymore, because they lose money hand over fist. So, it doesn't work. But it's scary because sometimes people vote for it because it sounds good. It sounds good, but it's really bad. We're going to give you tax cuts. [cheers and applause] We're going to give you additional tax cuts. We made our country wealthy. We made our country better than it had ever been before, and we did it. We did it. The big difference is we had a man serving for three and a half years with her at his side, and we had us. And prior, we did a great job on COVID, never got the credit. I got great credit for the economy, in all fairness to the fake news. I got great credit for the economy, great credit for the military. We defeated ISIS. We had no new wars. We rebuilt our military. Think of that. We came up with a new and very important organization, to put it mildly, first time since the Air Force, almost 80 years, Space Force, and we took space, where we were languishing to China, falling way behind China and Russia, we took space, and now we're dominating them. We put some incredible people in there. Space Force has been so important. It'll end up being one of our truly important—already is, I mean, it's coordinating with—but we created Space Force. We did so many things. Right to Try medically. Right to Try. If you're terminally ill, you had no right to get medicine. Now you sign a document. They tried to get that for 58 years. 58 years they were unable to get it. I sat everybody down: the labs, the doctors, the insurance companies, and the country, because they didn't want to be sued. Somebody's terminally ill, they take something, they die, and then the family sues them for killing the mother, the father, the sister, the brother. And I said, ""No, you're going to sign a document, and you're not going to sue anybody, but you're going to go home, and you're going to have the greatest drugs in the world that won't be approved for another four or five years."" They're terminally ill. And we have saved thousands and thousands of lives. Thousands. [cheers and applause] So we did a lot, and we have a lot of other things planned. Oh, by the way, all of that great work done, we had the greatest lab technicians, the greatest doctors, the greatest laboratories in the world, all of that, under her system, gets wiped out. They're close to a lot of great cures. I worked very hard on that. I also worked very hard on the FDA, getting them to bring it down, bring it down because it was going to ","take an average of 12 years to get something approved. I got it down to five. I wanted to get it down to two, but things have to happen. But we got it way, way down, and we came up with things. And we have thousands of people that are living today that were considered terminally ill just a short while ago. It's one of the things I'm most proud—it's called Right to Try. And hopefully, nobody in this room needs it, but if you do, you don't have to go to Asia. You don't have to go to Europe. Or if you have no money, you go home and you die. That's what happens. Mostly, people don't have any hope. They go home and die. Now you have Right to Try, and thousands of people are living right now that would not be living. We're also pleased to be joined by a very special man, a friend of mine who's been a warrior from day one, Dan Muser, Congressman Dan Meuser. Thank you, Dan. Great job. Mrs. Meuser, thank you. What a great job. Thank you. Thank you both for being here. No, I'm telling you, he's been fantastic. A man who would defend me a lot on fake news, CNN. A former senator from your state, your Commonwealth, who was, frankly, a very talented man. He was very good on television. He spent most of his time defending me. Rick Santorum, former senator. Rick, thank you very much. I appreciate the defense. Thank you. [cheers and applause] Former Congressman Fred Keller. Fred. Thank you very much, doing. The next congressman from Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District, Rob Bresnahan. Fred. You look good. You look good. He looks good. Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity. Thank you, Stacy. Great job you're Thank you, Rob. [cheers and applause] Good. Great primary win. I endorsed him. He went through. Great job. That was a big win. Candidate for the 7th Congressional District, Ryan Mackenzie. [cheers and applause Ryan, thank you. Congratulations. A man who we picked because, unlike a lot of states, including this one, we were leading by a lot, and then, all of a sudden, a miracle happened. We had another miracle happen about four weeks ago too, but this was a big miracle, and they found millions of votes. They found a lot of votes. But they didn't do that in North Carolina where he was the head of the Republican Party. And I said, ""Who is that guy?"" His name is Michael Whatley, and we appointed him the head of the RNC, the Republican National Committee, and he is doing a fantastic job. [cheers and applause Really, really a great job. Thank you very much. He's going to keep their cheating down to a minimum, right? Maybe nothing, but we know them better. They won't stop. They won't stop. We have an expression, ""Too big to rig,"" right? ""Too big to rig."" [cheers and applause] And we're leading by a lot, even though we now have to run against some—think of it. I spent 100 million. Now I have to run against somebody else. Is that fair? I think they should reimburse me for the 100 million. Who wants to collect? Does anybody want to go and collect? I'll get Front Row Joe to collect. The mayor, who's really a wonderful man, by the way. Mr. Mayor, it was good meeting you. Carl Curran. Thank you. Carl. Thank you very much. Thank you, Carl. [cheers and applause] Good man. New York's Broome County DA, Paul Battisti. Paul Battisti. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Paul. Thank you. Good job you're doing. I wish you were in Manhattan. We could use a good one in Manhattan. And Lackawanna County Commissioner Chris Chermak. [cheers and applause] Chris. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Chris. Good job. [cheers and applause] On my first day back in the Oval Office, I will immediately sign an executive order directing every cabinet secretary and agency head to use every power we have to drive prices down. But we're going to drive them down in a capitalist way, not in a communist way. At the center of this effort will be to end Kamala's war on American energy, and we will drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause] We're going to get your energy prices down. We're going to get your energy prices down by 50%. The Kamala presidency will mean death for Pennsylvania energy. Remember that. It'll mean death for Pennsylvania energy. Kamala imposed a natural gas export ban to cripple Pennsylvania energy producers. You do know that she's against this whole energy thing that you have going, which is by far the most important thing you have from an economic standpoint, a job standpoint. She's against it. Kamala supports a carbon tax on the working class, and she's vowed that she will ban fracking, which means 423, 000 plus at least 150,000 jobs beyond that. Pennsylvania is going to always be fracking because we desperately need the energy, and we desperately need the jobs. [cheers and applause] But she will end it. She will end it. In addition, your state and local government will be starved of billions of dollars in oil and gas revenue, which means higher taxes, lower property values, worse schools, and plunging quality of life in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that I love. I've spent a lot of time here. I told you I went to school here, the Wharton School of Finance at Penn. [cheers and applause] Under my leadership, we will make America energy independent and energy dominant, and Pennsylvania energy workers will lead the way. You're going to lead the way. It's big stuff. To further combat inflation, I will terminate Kamala Harris's green new scam, it's the greatest scam maybe ever played, and rescind all of the unspent funds. We're going to take those unspent funds and use them for roads and bridges, and we're going to give back a lot of money into the Treasury and pay down debt. [cheers and applause] To make both new and used cars more affordable, I will end the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate on day one, one of the most ridiculous things. [cheers and applause] One of the most ridiculous things. Kamala now claims to want to cut red tape, but in less than four years, she's buried American families in regulations costing a typical household much more than $5,000 per year. Think of that. Just with their red tape. I will cancel Kamala's crushing regulatory onslaught, and I will immediately eliminate every costly job. Now, just so you know, I cut regulations more than any president in history by far. [cheers and applause By far. So you can't say to me, ""Well, why didn't you do it?"" With me, you can't say that on anything. I did do it, everything I said. They said, ""Promises made, promises kept."" What I said, I kept, I mean, unless there was some crazy thing somewhere. But I got it done. I got it all done. Even the wall. I built hundreds of miles of wall. [cheers and applause] And I had to fight Congress. I had to fight the Senate like you wouldn't believe. I built hundreds of miles of wall. And I ended up taking it out and winning in court. We had 11 lawsuits by mostly Democrats like Nancy Pelosi. We had 11 different—we won every one of them. But think of it, I built the wall. I said, ""I'm taking it out of the military because our country's being invaded. This is an invasion of our country."" And we built hundreds of miles of wall. Then we built and had made an extra 200 miles that we were going to use to expand it further than I ever said, and it was made and ready to be installed, and we had a rigged election. And what happened after that was they didn't want to do it, and they sold it for 5 cents on the dollar. [booing] 5 cents. Very sophisticated stuff, too. To get economic relief to workers and families, I will make the Trump tax cuts permanent, and we will have no tax on tips, which she copied. [cheers and applause] She copied. You all know by now, she came out a few days ago, and she said, ""There will be no tax on—"" I said, ""I said that months ago."" But here's one that she hasn't copied yet, to help seniors on fixed incomes who are suffering the ravages of horrible inflation caused by Crooked Joe and Kamala, there will be no tax on Social Security, so get out— And I get it done. [cheers and applause] I will get it done. They won't. They haven't even promised it to you, but they won't get it done if they do. And I will always protect Social Security and Medicare for our great seniors, just as I did for four incredible years. By contrast, Kamala Harris has a three-step plan to destroy Medicare and Social Security. She's going to destroy your Medicare. She's going to destroy your Social Security. First, she has thrown open our borders. Second, she is flooding our country with millions and millions of low-wage migrants and giving them welfare: free healthcare, food stamps, public benefits. [booing] And third, she wants to make them all citizens of the United States. [booing] Many of them coming from prison, many of them coming from mental institutions, and many are terrorists. She wants to make them citizens, dumping them onto Medicare, and dumping them into your beautiful Social Security program. Remember, for four years, I saved Social Security. I never gave an increase. I never raised the age by five years, which is what they're going to end up doing. With me, it's staying the way it is. We have a lot of ways we're making money. We don't need to take it away from our seniors. The millions of illegal aliens pouring in under border czar—she was the border czar, right? She was the border czar. Now, about a month ago, she said, ""I wasn't—wasn't the border czar. She was the border czar. But it doesn't matter. She was in charge of the border a hundred percent. But border czar Harris are coming in from the worst places, some of the most dangerous countries in the world. And as I said, they're emptying out their jails and prisons and they're emptying out their mental institutions and they're dumping them into our country. What's happening to our country is shocking. It's unacceptable. And we have no choice. We're going to do the largest deportation in the history of our country. [cheers and applause] We have no choice. [cheers and applause] Just this week in Coney Island II, Kamala migrants were arrested for the rape of a 46-year-old woman, throwing her to the ground and raping her with a knife to her throat. [booing] She thought they were going to kill her. She said, ""They weren't looking to rape me. They were looking to kill me."" And it was a terrible thing. One of them had previously been arrested for raping another woman at a migrant shelter, but he was shielded from deportation by New York City sanctuary laws, which Kamala Harris strongly supported and doesn't want to change. [booing] In Virginia, three weeks ago, a 54-year-old mother of four was leaving a 7/11 when she noticed an illegal alien trying to steal her car. When she tried to stop him, he ran her down and left her dead on the ground before going on to hit two more cars, killing two other drivers. And in May, the leader of a Peruvian gang known as Los Killers, was released from border patrol custody, and set free into America and Kamala's direct orders, she said, ""Set him free."" Meanwhile, he was wanted for 23 murders in Peru. Kamala refuses even to call these criminals, and we not going to use the term, she said, illegal aliens. No, they are illegal aliens, but she said, ""Don't ever use that term."" But they're not just illegal aliens, honestly, they're monsters. These are savage monsters. [cheers and applause] The Harris policy is to let thousands of migrant killers and rapists into our country. She was asked the other day, but she didn't respond. We have detention centers where we have some of the worst criminals in the world in those detention centers from other countries and not just South America. They come from Africa, they come from Asia, they come from the Middle East. They come from countries that are seriously crime ridden. And those countries, the crimes are going way down like Venezuela. We talked about Venezuela or before, and think about Venezuela. Their crime is down 72%. They've gone to Caracas and they've gone to different places in Venezuela. They've taken their murderers, their drug dealers, their rapists, their thugs and they've taken them out of the country. They've said, ""You're going to the United States of America and if you come back, we will kill you."" And they are now living with us. All will be criminals soon. And don't forget, they're just getting used to the experience of being in a country where criminals are treated better, far better than the people that are being hurt and victimized. [booing] And when they see that and they're going to have levels of crime, I call it migrant crime, we'll call it Kamala migrant crime. She destroyed San Francisco. She destroyed Los Angeles. I call it migrant crime. She had something that she went with. You're not a criminal. It's a very minor offense if you steal anything from a store that's less than $950, did you know that? So guys are walking into stores with—they walk into stores with a calculator, keep it under 950 and nothing's going to happen. By the way, if it goes to 9,050, nothing happens either. What's happened in California with Governor Newsom and guys like this, people like this is terrible. But Kamala, but Kamala, what environment, what a beautiful place, what a great place. The weather is so beautiful, the ocean, everything's beautiful. Its crime ridden and horrible and changes have to be made. The Trump policy is to keep these savage criminals the hell out of our country. [cheers and applause They're going to be out of our country. If Kamala wins, you'll have mass amnesty and citizenship for all. She wants to give all of these people citizenship. In Venezuela, their crime is down 72%. In other countries all over the world, their crime is way down. And in our country, wait till you see the real numbers because they're not counting migrant crime, which is going to make our crime look like baby stuff. If I win, you will have the largest operation of police to take care of us. They have to take care of us. They want to take care of us. They want to do their job. [cheers and applause] As border patrol wants to do their job and it's going to start on inauguration day, January 20th, 2025. It's going to start immediately. [cheers and applause] They want to do their job and we don't let them. And if they do their job and if they're a little bit strong about doing their job, they're dealing with a lot of very tough people. They take away their pension, they take away their job, they lose their family, they lose their house, they lose everything. They end up in squalor. And we're not going to do that. We're going to defend our great local police and law enforcement. In general, we're going to defend them. [cheers and applause] We're going to defend them. We want them to protect us and we're going to need them much more than ever before because the criminals pouring into our country by the millions. I believe the real number is over 20 million people. You don't hear that. 10 million, 12 million, even if it was, it's still so many. But the real number is over 20 million people. That's larger than New York state. Kamala Harris wants to eliminate private health insurance and give free taxpayer funded healthcare to every single illegal alien in the country. [booing] And then you wonder why do they come up? You know why they come up? Because guys like Newsom and others are saying, ""Come up, come to our country. We'll give you healthcare."" You know what they're doing to your school system is incredible. People are taking the seats of your children. Your children can't go to school. And you have people taking their seats that don't speak a word of English, come from a foreign country and your kids aren't getting educated. Your kids are not getting educated. They're considered like secondary citizens. And this is Kamala and Joe to a lesser extent. Look, Joe, Joe's lost. He's—forget him. By contrast, I'm going to keep the Affordable Care Act unless we can do something much better. We'll keep it, but we can do much better. It's too expensive for the people. They can't afford it. It's lousy healthcare. If we can do something better, we're working on it. If we can do something better, but we will never let anybody touch it unless we have something better. We're going to deliver lower prices, lower drug costs, and new options that will dramatically reduce the crushing burden on all American patients. And Kamala and Crooked Joe, they try and take credit for $35 insulin, but I was the one that did the $35 insulin, not them. [cheers and applause] Just kicked in during their administration. I remember a couple of years, a few years ago, I said, ""Boy, oh boy."" They said, ""Sir, this will kick in over the next two and a half, three years."" I said, ""What about now?"" You couldn't do it, just to process. I said, ""I hope I win the presidency because I want to get credit for that."" But he gets up there, ""Oh, we got $35."" I got it. Kamala Harris,' Democrat Party is the party of healthcare for illegals. The Republican Party is the party of common sense. We really are the party of common sense ultimately. [cheers and applause] So we will bring back our supply chain, the supply chains, and they've been so devastated. Our supply chains are— You order something and they say, ""Sir, that'll be four months."" And then four months comes up and they say it's going to be another four months. It's stuck at sea. They have no idea where the hell it is. But we're going to bring them back from China and other foreign countries ending costly supply chain disruptions. And they are really bad. There is bad now as they were—but we get used to it. We're living like a third-world country. Who thought? As we reduce burdens on domestic manufacturers, American workers will make our critical goods better and cheaper right here in the USA and right here in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] And I will, with David, revoke China's most favored nation's trade status. You know, hey have a huge advantage. Because they are a growing nation. Well, we're a growing nation too. We're a nation that is crippled. We are a horribly crippled nation. And China gets all of these advantages in trade because they consider themselves to be a growing nation. Well, we're a growing nation too. And I did that already. I will pass what will be known as the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. If China or any other country makes us pay 100 or 200% tariff, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff of 100 or 200% right back. You hurt us, we hurt you. It's called an eye for an eye. I will also restore peace through strength and I will prevent World War III from happening. We will stop it. [cheers and applause] When crooked, Hillary Clinton was running against me. She said, ""Look at him. Listen to him. He will start a war, a world war."" We had no wars other than I defeated ISIS in its entirety, 100% of the ISIS caliber. ""Listen to his rhetoric. Listen to his horrible tone."" I said that horrible tone is going to keep people from fighting us, and that's what happened. We had no wars. It's been 81 years since that happened for a president. No wars other than ending some wars that we are in and defeating ISIS. Two days ago, I watched a parade of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Did you see it? The Taliban were—they were showing all of our equipment that they took from America, $85 billion worth, two days ago, celebrating three years of the defeat of America by these guys. And I knew them very well. Abdul was the head. Abdul was not playing games with me. They were executing a lot of our soldiers. And I spoke to him. I said, ""Abdul, don't do it anymore. There'll be no more."" Anyway, I said it pretty tough. And you know what? For 18 months we didn't have one American soldier killed in Afghanistan. [cheers and applause] And then I left. And then I left. And this bunch of incompetent people took over and it all started up again. And then they had the most embarrassing day in the history of our country, I thought. But she bragged about being the last person in the room that night, the night that they decided to do whatever they decided to do. In other words, she had the final vote and she bragged about it. It's been the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan. It should have never, ever happened. We should have gotten out with dignity and strength. And you don't take your military out first. You take your military out last. They couldn't believe we did it. Under Trump, we will have no more wars, no more disruptions, and we will have prosperity and peace for all. And again, we're going to bring back that American dream for all of the young people in this audience and some of the old ones. This is how we will end the era of inflation, mayhem and misery under Kamala and crooked Joe Biden and unleash safety, prosperity, and promise for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Every single one of them are going to understand peace and wealth. And we're going to be a dominant force again. We're going to be respected as a country again. Right now, we're being laughed at that. [cheers and applause] Together we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation. We had almost no inflation during my four years, almost nothing. And they went up to nine and a half percent. And that number's a fake number because they don't add the worst categories. It was much higher than that. But it was record setting inflation that everyone can—we're going to make sure—afford your groceries, afford a car, afford a home, low interest rates. We're going to get it all down. We will stop the invasion. We will end migrant crime. We'll support our great police. We will strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield over the top of our country, an iron dome. It'll be a great iron dome and much of it will be made right here in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] Why shouldn't we have that? Why shouldn't we have that? Other countries can have it, but we can't. It was our idea. Ronald Reagan wanted it many years ago. But then in all fairness, you didn't have the technology. Today, you do. We're going to have an iron dome to protect us from the lunatics out there. And we're going to keep critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools and we are going to keep men out of women's sports. No men in women's sports. Did you see in the Olympics? They had two transitioned. They transitioned. Uh they were men. They transitioned to women and they were in the boxing. And a young Italian woman was boxing one of the transitioned men. And she got hit with a jab. [mimes punching] Just boom. A jab is not like the hard—this is the harder one, right? If you're right-handed. Boom. And she backed up. She said, ""What just hit me. I just got hit with a horse. What just hit me?"" Think of that. Then he did it again. Boom. And she said, ""Okay, that's enough."" Two jabs. Then the other one—and by the way, he went on to easily win the gold medal. He just walked through everybody. [booing] He won the gold medal. Then there was another one, a transitioned man, and he also won the gold medal. He transitioned and he won the gold medal very easily. So the two fighters won the gold medals very easily. And she came out, the Italian girl, beautiful girl, very good boxer. And she said, ""Nobody's ever hit me like that."" Two jabs. She said, ""I've never been hit."" She just said, ""That's enough. That's enough."" It's crazy. It's so demeaning to women. How about the weightlifting? Hundreds of pounds more hundreds. Records that haven't been broken in 18 years. One eighth of an ounce here, one eighth of an ounce. And they can't do it. You could do it. They can't do it. And a guy comes out, excuse me, a transitioned person. How much more is that? Oh, that's 128 pounds more. How crazy is this? Our country has gone crazy and we're going to put it back on track. We are the party of common sense. [cheers and applause] We will defend the Second Amendment, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive. We're going to be a thriving country again. And every day we'll be filled with joy, opportunity, and hope. Right now, it's filled with sorrow. It's sorrow. People are so embarrassed by what's happening to our country. They're waiting for Iran to drop weapons all over Israel. But it hasn't happened. You know why? Because our country is willing to pay them billions and billions of dollars. How about where they negotiate? I had 58 people; we negotiated and we didn't pay. 58 hostages I got out. 59 I think, and got them out even from North Korea, the toughest. Had a good relationship with Kim Jong-Un. But I got them out. But you never pay because once you pay, you got to pay. How about we pay $6 billion, 6 billion and we get some out. And in the case of Russia, they get the Prince of Doom. You know who the Prince of—the greatest arms dealer, they say in the history of the world and they got him. And we also gave $6 billion. It's so embarrassing. And the world is watching. And when you pay $6 billion, all of a sudden people are going to be disappearing from the streets all over the place. And it's a very bad precedent is being set in many ways, including the weaponization of our government. I could have done that with Hillary Clinton. And I said to myself, ""How would it look? We're trying to unify the country. How would it look if I had arrested and put in prison the wife of the President of the United States?"" I thought it was not good. And then they do that to me. They want to put me away. But you know what? I get indicted for you. To me, I'm just here. I'm just standing in their way. [cheers and applause] I said to them, ""Fellas, you know—"" I was no fan of Hillary, but I said, ""How would it look if we put her in prison? We're going to put Hillary Clinton, the wife and a Secretary of State. We're going to put her in prison?"" But we never did this stuff. And then I came along. It's double standard. They do. They want to do it to me. So far, they've been very unsuccessful. But they would like to. We must defeat Kamala Harris and we must stop her country destroying liberal agenda, liberal like nobody's ever seen in the history of our country. So get your friends, get your family register, volunteer. Get out and vote and vote for that guy right there, David. [cheers and applause] The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020 and we not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024. [cheers and applause] And we want a landslide. Not going to let it happen. We're not going to have a country left. You need two things to start. You need a strong, beautiful, fair border and you need fair and free elections. And we have neither, right? [cheers and applause]We have neither. On November 5th, we will save our economy. We will rescue our middle class. We will reclaim our sovereignty and restore our borders. We will put America first and we will fight, fight, fight. We're going to fight. We're going to fight for our country. [cheers and applause] CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. But this is a very consequential commonwealth as we say. But this is a very consequential vote in Pennsylvania because they say that if you win Pennsylvania, you're going to win the whole thing. [cheers and applause] We cannot let these people win Pennsylvania. That includes David. Can't let it happen. And together we will make America powerful again. [cheers and applause] We're going to make it powerful, powerful. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. [cheers and applause] We will make America safe again. We will make America free again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] [music: Village People, YMCA.]",""

(Applause.) Oh, it's good to be back in North Carolina. Oh, it's good to see everyone. (Applause.) Thank you. Oh, it's good to see everyone. Good afternoon. Everyone, please have a seat, if you have a seat. (Laughter.) Please have a seat. Mike D, I have to -- so, Mike D's Barbecue -- let me tell you one of the biggest fans of Mike D's barbecue: my husband, Doug Emhoff. (Laughs.) (Applause.) And -- and thank you, Mike, for sharing your story. And -- and I'm just so sorry for what your family has been through, but you have, out of an incredible tragedy, done so much for the community, and you are such a role model. So, thank you, Mike, for everything you do. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. And good afternoon to everyone here. Thank you to all of the incredible leaders with us today, including my friend, the governor, Roy Cooper. Where is he? (Applause.) Here with his daughter. Every time I land in North Carolina, I -- just literally coming down the stairs of Air Force Two, I will shout to Roy Cooper, ""What number is it, Roy?"" (Laughter.) And today, he shouted, ""16,"" which is the number of times I've been in this beautiful state since I've been vice president. (Applause.) Every time. I want to thank your next governor, Attorney General Josh Stein. (Applause.) He's doing incredible work. He's going to be an extraordinary governor. Representatives Adam[s], Manning, Foushee, and Nickel, thank you all for your support, for your friendship, for your leadership. (Applause.) Chair Thomas of the Wake County Board of Commissioners, thank you for all that you do. (Applause.) And to all the leaders that are here today, including the students and instructors here at Wake Tech North, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) So, thank you all. So, listen, this election, I do strongly believe, is about two very different visions for our nation: one, ours, focused on the future; and the other, focused on the past. We see that contrast clearly in many ways, including when it comes to how we think about the economy. So, our country has come a long way since President Biden and I took office. At that time, we sadly remember the millions of Americans that were out of work. We were facing one of the worst economic crises in modern history. And, today, by virtually every measure, our economy is the strongest in the world. (Applause.) We have created 16 million new jobs. We have made historic investments in infrastructure, in chips manufacturing, in clean energy. And new numbers this week alone show that inflation is down under 3 percent. (Applause.) And as president of the United States, it will be my intention to build on the foundation of this progress. Still, we know that many Americans don't yet feel that progress in their daily lives. Costs are still too high. And on a deeper level, for too many people, no matter how much they work, it feels so hard to just be able to get ahead. As president, I will be laser-focused on creating opportunities for the middle class that advance their economic security, stability, and dignity. Together, we will build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" -- (applause) -- ""an opportunity economy"" -- an economy where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed; everyone, regardless of who they are or where they start, has an opportunity to build wealth for themselves and their children; and where we remove the barriers to opportunity so anyone who wants to start a business or advance their career can access the tools and the resources that are necessary to do so. (Applause.) I will focus on cutting needless bureaucracy and unnecessary regulatory red tape and encouraging -- (applause) -- and encouraging innovative technologies while protecting consumers and creating a stable business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road. As president, I will bring together labor with small businesses and major companies to invest in America, to create good jobs, achieve broad-based growth, and ensure that America continues to define the future and lead the world. (Applause.) And key -- key to creating this opportunity economy is building up our middle class. It is essential. (Applause.) The middle class is one of America's greatest strengths, and to protect it, then, we must defend basic principles -- such as, your salary should be enough to provide you and your family with a good quality of life. (Applause.) Such as, no child should have to grow up in poverty. (Applause.) Such as, after years of hard work, you should be able to retire with dignity. (Applause.) And you should be able to join a union if you choose. Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency, because I strongly believe when the middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.) So, in the weeks to come, I will address in greater detail my plans to build an opportunity economy. And, today, I will focus on one element that's on the minds of many Americans as they pay their bills at the kitchen table or walk the aisles of a grocery store, and that is lowering the cost of living. (Applause.) So, every day across our nation, families talk about their plans for the future; their ambitions; their aspirations for themselves, for their children; and they talk about how they're going to be able to actually achieve them financially. Because, look, the bills add up -- food, rent, gas, back-to-school clothes, prescription medication. After all that, for many families, there's mo- -- not much left at the end of the month. I grew up in a middle-class household. For most of my childhood, we were renters. My mother saved for well over a decade to buy a home. I was a teenager when that day finally came, and I can remember so well how excited she was. I kind of understood what it meant, but -- we called her ""Mommy"" -- Mommy was so excited, it just made us excited that she was so excited. (Laughter.) Later in college, I worked at McDonald's to earn spending money. Well, some of the people I worked with were raising families on that paycheck. They worked second or even third jobs to pay rent and buy food. That only gets harder when the cost of living goes up. When I am elected president, I will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans. As president, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the cost of food. We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed, but our supply chains have now improved and prices are still too high. A lo- -- a loaf of bread costs 50 percent more today than it did before the pandemic. Ground beef is up almost 50 percent. Many of the big food companies are seeing their highest profits in two decades. And while many grocery chains pass along these savings, others still aren't. Look, I know most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy, and playing by the rules, but some are not, and that's just not right, and we need to take action when that is the case. A- -- (applause) -- As attorney general in California, I went after companies that illegally increased prices, including wholesalers that inflated the price of prescription medication and companies that conspired with competitors to keep prices of electronics high. I won more than $1 billion for consumers. (Applause.) So, believe me, as president, I will go after the bad actors. (Applause.) And I will work to pass the first-ever federal ban on prou- -- price gauging [gouging] on food. (Applause.) My plan will include new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules, and we will support smaller food businesses that are trying to play by the rules and get ahead. (Applause.) We will help the food industry become more competitive, because I believe competition is the lifeblood of our economy. More competition means lower prices for you and your families. (Applause.) Now compare what Donald Trump plans to do. He wants to impose what is, in effect, a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that we import from other countries. That will devastate Americans. It will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs: a Trump tax on gas, a Trump tax on food, a Trump tax on clothing, a Trump tax on over-the-counter medication. And, you know, economists have done the math. Donald Trump's plan would cost a typical family $3,900 a year. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: At this moment when everyday prices are too high, he will make them even higher. As president, I'll attack and take on the issue of the cost of health care. As attorney general, I took on insurance companies and Big Pharma and got them to lower their prices. (Applause.) And together with President Biden, we've gone even further. We capped the price of insulin at $35 a month and the total cost -- (applause) -- and the total cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year for seniors. We let Medicare negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. And just yesterday -- and just yesterday, we announced that we are lowering the price by up to 80 percent for 10 more lifesaving drugs. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I pledge to continue this progress. I'll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone with your support, not only our seniors -- (applause) -- and demand transparency from the middlemen who operate between Big Pharma and the insurance companies, who use opaque practices to raise your drug prices and profit off your need for medicine. Two months ago, I announced that medical debt will no longer be used against your credit score. (Applause.) And I will work, as president, with states like here in North Carolina -- Roy Cooper, thank you again -- to cancel medical debt for more and more -- millions more Americans. (Applause.) As for Donald Trump, well, he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- which 45 million Americans rely on. Forty-five million Americans rely on it for health care. That would take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. We all remember what that was -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and we're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And -- and remember -- and this is why we're not going back, because we do remember -- (laughter) -- he tried to cut Medicare every year he was president, threatening a program that tens of millions of seniors count on. And according to his Project 2025 agenda, he intends to undo our work to bring down prescription drugs -- the cost of prescription drugs and insulin costs. Well, we've come too far to let that happen. (Applause.) So, we're not going back on that, and let's talk about the cost of housing. (Applause.) So, now, the housing market can be complicated, but, look, I'm not new to this issue. As state attorney general, I drafted and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first in America. And during the foreclosure crisis, I took on the big banks for predatory lending with many of my colleagues, including Roy Cooper, and won $20 billion for California families when I was attorney general. (Applause.) So, I know how to fight for people who are being exploited in the housing market, and I know what homeownership means. It's more than a financial transaction. It's so much more than that. It's more than a house. Homeownership and what that means -- it's a symbol of the pride that comes with hard work. It's financial security. It represents what you will be able to do for your children. (Applause.) And sadly, right now, it is out of reach for far too many American families. There's a serious housing shortage in many places. It's too difficult to build, and it's driving prices up. As president, I will work in partnership with industry to build the housing we need, both to rent and to buy. We will take down barriers and cut red tape, including at the state and local levels. (Applause.) And by the end of my first term, we will end America's housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class, and we will do that together. We will do that together. (Applause.) And -- and we will make sure those homes actually go to working- and middle-class Americans -- (applause) -- not just investors. Because, you know, some corporate landlords -- some of them buy dozens, if not hundreds, of houses and apartments. Then they turn them around and rent them out at extremely high prices, and it can make it impossible, then, for regular people to be able to buy or even rent a home. Some corporate landlords collude with each other to set artificially high rental prices, often using algorithms and price-fixing software to do it. It's anticompetitive, and it drives up costs. I will fight for a law that cracks down on these practices. (Applause.) We also know that as the price of housing has gone up, the size of down payments have gone up as well. Even if aspiring homeowners save for years, it often still is not enough. So, in addition, while we work on the housing shortage, my administration will provide first-time homebuyers with $25,000 to help with the down payment on a new home. (Applause.) We can do this. We can do this, all to help more Americans experience the pride of homeownership and the financial security that it represents and brings. So, that's my plan. But here's what Donald Trump would do. If his Project 2025 agenda is put into effect, it will add around $1,200 a year to the typical American mortgage. He's got it backward. We should be doing everything we can to make it more affordable to buy a home, not less. (Applause.) Finally, there's one more way I will help families deal with rising costs, and that's by letting you keep more of your hard-earned money. (Applause.) Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut, and we will do this by restoring two tax cuts designed to help middle-class and working Americans: the Earned Income Tax Credit -- (applause) -- and the Child Tax Credit -- (applause) -- through which millions of Americans with children got to keep more of their hard-earned income. We know this works and has a direct impact on so many issues, including child poverty. We know it works. So, as president, I'll not only restore that tax cut but expand it. We will provide $6,000 in tax relief to families during the first year of a child's life. Now, think what that means. (Applause.) Think what that means. That is a vital -- vital year of critical development of a child, and the costs can really add up, especially for young parents who need to buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else. And we will do this while reducing the deficit. Compare my plan with what Donald Trump intends to do. He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts year after year and he plans to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars, even as they pull in record profits. And that's on top of the $2 trillion tax cut he already signed into law when he was president, which, by the way, overwhelming- -- overwhelmingly went to the wealthiest Americans and corporations and exploded the national deficit. You know, I think that if you want to know who someone cares about, look who they fight for -- look who they fight for. (Applause.) Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations. We -- I will fight to give money back to working- and middle-class Americans. (Applause.) So, I'll end with this. Two days ago, Donald Trump was here in North Carolina. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He said he was going to talk about the economy -- (laughter) -- I think you all watched; you know what I'm about to say -- but he offered no serious plans to reduce costs for middle-class families, no plan to expand access to housing or health care. And that, actually, I think, for most of us, was not surprising because we already know his plans. We know the Project 2025 agenda. So, there's a choice in this election: Donald Trump's plans to devastate the middle class, punish working people, and make the cost of living go up for millions of Americans; and, on the other hand, when I'm elected president, what we'll do -- (applause) -- what we will do to bring down costs, increase the security and stability financially of your family, and expand opportunity for working- and middle-class Americans. (Applause.) So, now -- now -- now is the time to chart a new way forward. (Applause.) Now is the time to chart a new way forward, to build -- AUDIENCE: A new way forward! A new way forward! A new way forward! THE VICE PRESIDENT: A new way forward, yes. A new way forward. AUDIENCE: A new way forward! A new way forward! A new way forward! THE VICE PRESIDENT: To build -- to build an America where everyone's work is rewarded and talents are valued, where we work with labor and business to strengthen the American economy, and where everyone has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead. So, I thank you, North Carolina. We're going to get this done -- (applause) -- and with your help. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you. (Applause.)","","",""

(Applause.) Wow. Wow. One more time for Tilly. Thank you. (Applause.) Well, hello, Las Vegas. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Now, I know some of you spent the week googling Minnesota a little bit -- (laughter) -- and to figure out who these Minnesotans were. Here's the one thing I can tell you about us. We spend about half our lives talking about the weather. (Laughter.) It's what we do. So, I want to say thank you to all of the people since I've been here to remind me that it's a dry heat outside. (Laughter.) So -- so is your damn oven, but, you know, that's -- (laughter) -- I'm melting like a snowman outside. But, look, this is incredible. And I want to say a thank you to a few folks I had the privilege of working with when I served in Congress. You have two of the best senators you could ever hope for -- (applause): Senator Cortez Masto and Senator Rosen. Just as a side note, there's lots of commonalities here -- it may not be the weather; we walk on water half the year it's so damn cold, but that's what we are. But we have something in common. Both Minnesota and Nevada have two women senators, and that's a pretty good thing. (Applause.) Huge thank you to Congressman Horsford -- (applause); Congresswoman Lee -- (applause); and -- and a longtime friend I served with, Congresswoman Titus. Grateful. (Applause.) A special thank you is for what I'm looking at right here: to every one of you. You took time out of your busy lives. You didn't need to be here. There's many things you could have been doing. You chose. You braved 108-degree heat -- I can't even believe I'm saying that -- (laughter) -- just to be here. And I have to tell you, I understand, because of the heat, they had to shut the door early and turn thousands of folks away. AUDIENCE: Aww -- GOVERNOR WALZ: But don't worry, we're going to be back a lot. (Laughs.) (Applause.) All the things -- you got babysitters; you had to do everything -- but you came here for something bigger than yourselves for one simple, eloquent, and beautiful reason: You love this country. (Applause.) Thank you. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! GOVERNOR WALZ: USA! AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! GOVERNOR WALZ: I'm so incredibly proud to be on this ticket -- and I want to give a big shout-out -- with the support of a special group tonight, Culinary Workers Union 226. (Applause.) We're here for that love, and the end of this road -- remember, 87 days. Rarely in your life do you get an opportunity in 87 days to change the trajectory of not just today or tomorrow but for generations around the world. (Applause.) And I keep saying this: We can do anything for 87 days. And my mantra is, ""We'll sleep when we're dead."" We'll sleep when we're dead. (Applause.) Because when you wake up on that 88th day, you're going to get to say, ""Welcome, Madam President Harris."" (Applause.) This is -- this is a leader that wakes up every day to try and do things for the American people. She will -- she took on the predators, the fraudsters, the transnational gangs; stood up against the greed of corporate interests -- (applause); stood with working people in organized labor -- (applause); and never failed to reach across the aisle if it meant improving people's lives. (Applause.) I was taught a little something about that commitment too. I was born in a small town in Nebraska where community was a way of life. (Applause.) There's some Nebraskans in the house. Yay, Cornhuskers. You think I'm kidding. You think I'm kidding. Four hundred people, 25 kids in my class, 12 were cousins. That's small town. (Laughter.) That's small town. But you know what? My parents and my community taught me generosity towards my neighbor and to work for the common good. (Applause.) My -- my dad was a chain-smoking, Korean War-era veteran, who two days after my 17th birthday took me down to sign up to join the National Guard. (Applause.) I was proud, for the next 24 years, to wear the uniform of this country. (Applause.) Thank -- thank you to every single one of you who wore that uniform. And I have to tell you, like my dad before me and millions of others, the G.I. Bill gave me a shot at a college education. (Applause.) And just -- and just like Tilly, my dad was a teacher, my older brother was a teacher, my sister was a teacher, my younger brother was a teacher. (Applause.) And we married teachers, so -- (laughter). The privilege of my lifetime was spending two decades teaching in public schools t- -- (applause) -- and -- and, you might have heard, coaching football to a state championship, so -- (applause). Here's -- AUDIENCE: Coach! Coach! Coach! GOVERNOR WALZ: Don't ever close that yearbook. That's my pro tip. (Laughter.) Look, my students and my players are the ones who encouraged me to run for office. They saw in me what I hoped to instill in them: a commitment to a common good and something so important -- the belief, as each and every one of you came here as a single person, a single person can make a difference. (Applause.) Can make a difference. Never planned in my life to run for office, but I think my life prepared me well. And when my neighbors and -- asked if I'd run for office, I was pretty clueless. I did not know that the district I was running in had only had one Democrat since 1892 before me. (Laughter.) But my community graced me with the opportunity to represent them in the United States Congress for 12 years -- (applause) -- where I had the privilege of serving as the ranking member on the VA committee, working with Republicans to most -- pass the most extensive veterans package since the G.I. Bill. (Applause.) I learned -- I learned the art of compromising without compromising my values. (Applause.) And as -- now, as governor, I bring all those experience together to tackle the most pressing challenges we have in the great state of Minnesota. (Applause.) Now each of you came here -- you came here because you love the country. You came here because you know a fantastic leader is going to walk out those doors in a minute or two, the person that you see bringing everything to us. But just be very clear here: Donald Trump sees the world very differently than all of us here. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: Each of you talk about service. Donald Trump knows nothing about service. (Applause.) It's -- AUDIENCE MEMBERS: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! GOVERNOR WALZ: Yay. It's pretty hard to provide service to others when you're too busy looking out for only yourself. (Applause.) Again and again and again Donald Trump made decisions to weaken this country to strengthen his own hand. He mocked our laws, he sowed division and chaos amongst our citizens, and that's to say nothing of his record as president. He froze in the face of the global COVID pandemic, and our neigh- -- and our neighbors died because of it. By not addressing COVID -- by not addressing COVID, he drove our economy into the ground. (Applause.) And I just want to set the record straight, because facts do matter, and there's not an alternate set of facts. (Applause.) Here's one for you: Violent crime was up during the Trump presidency, and that's even not counting his crimes. (Laughter.) Some of you -- some of you gray-hair or no-hairs in here can actually remember a time when Republicans actually talked about freedom and believed in it. Not these guys. These are the guys that believe government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: I'm sure it's true here in Nevada, as it's true in Minnesota: We respect our neighbors' rights to make their own personal choices. (Applause.) We don't have to agree with them or make the same choice, but we know that this nation -- things work best when you mind your own damn business. When you mind your own damn business. (Applause.) I don't -- I don't need any help -- I don't need any help from those guys telling me which books to read. (Applause.) I sure the heck don't need any lecture about morality from those guys. (Applause.) And the last thing they can mind their own damn business is I don't need any help from them talking about my family. (Applause.) And this is where it gets personal, where they want to dictate things like IVF and reproductive care. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: I know there's a lot of you out there -- this is the most personal choices we have. When my wife and I decided to have children, we spent years going through fertility treatments, and I said, I remember -- We have somebody to help? We have water? AUDIENCE MEMBER: We need a medic. GOVERNOR WALZ: All right. Thanks for helping your neighbors. But I -- (applause) -- You're going to help them? You're good? All right. Thank you. I remember those -- waiting for the phone calls. You'd go through the treatments. I would have my neighbor come over to have to give shots to my wife and things like that. And the phone would ring, and you would just hope so highly that it would be good news. And then when you found out the treatments didn't work, it was a darkness that could blot out the sun. So, I have to tell you, it wasn't by chance when that phone call finally came and we found out we were going to welcome our daughter into the world -- (applause) -- we -- we named her the most powerful word in the universe: Hope. Hope. (Applause.) So, when you hear -- when you hear Kamala Harris and I talk about freedom -- we're very clear about this -- we mean the freedom to make your own health care decisions -- (applause) -- and that your children should be free to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in their classroom. (Applause.) Look, again, I know Nevada is a lot like Minnesota. In Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in commonsense gun violence laws. (Applause.) Vice President Harris believes education be a -- should be a ticket to the middle class, not crippling student loan debt. (Applause.) And we come here today because in 87 days, we're going to settle our political differences not through violence; we're going to settle it by beating them at the ballot box. (Applause.) So, look, I keep saying this. This is a pretty -- a pretty simple thing here. This election is about the choice about what direction this country will go in. And I want to be clear, I know very clearly that I am preaching to the choir, but here's my words for you: The choir needs to sing. The choir needs to sing. (Applause.) So, the other day I was saying this -- I started out by saying, ""Don't believe Donald Trump when he plays dumb about 2025,"" but then I remembered, you don't believe him on anything, because that's what you shouldn't believe. (Applause.) But, look, I coached football for enough years -- when somebody draws up a playbook, they plan on using it -- (applause) -- and when they do, they'll restrict our freedoms. When they do, they'll do what they've done: They'll rig the economy so that the middle class gets nothing and the rich get richer. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: If this guy gets an opportunity again, he won't only pick up where he left off, it will be much worse than it was last time. He'll gut Social Security, pull your health care, underfund public schools -- all of it. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! GOVERNOR WALZ: That's damn right. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! GOVERNOR WALZ: Damn right. We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! GOVERNOR WALZ: Look, this guy is not fighting for you or your family. He doesn't give a damn. And his running mate shares his dangerous and backward agenda. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: I said this: All of my friends, we went to Yale, had billionaires fund our career, and then we write a book trashing our neighbors that raised us. Come on. We're better than that. We're better than that. And I said it -- I want to be clear: I didn't call anybody names. I spent enough years in that lunchroom to know bullies when I see them. I just made a very clear observation that they seem to be really concerned about. I pointed out that taking away reproductive freedoms, banning books, raising the price of inlin -- insulin, trying to hurt labor unions -- nobody is asking for that weird crap. No one is asking for it. (Applause.) Here is the good news. We do the work -- this is about the future. We do the work, none of that's going to happen. Vice President Harris believes in those freedoms. She knows that every single person should get a chance at the middle class. She believes in something so beautiful: the promise of America. It's that simple: the promise of America. (Applause.) Madam Vice President, I want to say thank you for putting the trust in me to be your running mate. (Applause.) And I want to say, she has done so much. And with you together, it's reminded us about something. It's reminded us that this work can be about goodness. It can be about smiling. It's tough work, but we can be happy doing it. (Applause.) And -- and Kamala Harris has done something that we for forever be grateful for her: She has brought out the joy in our politics. (Applause.) Nevada, join me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hey, Nevada! (Applause.) Can we hear it for Tim Walz? (Applause.) Oh, it's so good to be back. Good evening, everyone. (Applause.) Good evening. Good evening. (Applause.) Oh, I see lots of friends. Oh, it is good to be back. It is good to be back. (Applause.) Thank you all. My goodness. (Applause.) S- -- but, seriously, isn't Tim Walz fantastic? (Applause.) And I know, for some folks, you're just getting to know him and you've heard he's had many titles over his life: governor, congressman, dad, husband, coach. (Laughs.) (Applause.) But in 87 days, our nation is going to know Coach Walz as vice president of the United States of America. (Applause.) That's right. And it is so good to be here with so many incredible leaders, including my dear friends Senator Catherine Cortez Masto -- (applause); Senator Jacky Rosen -- (applause) -- who we will reelect to the United States Senate -- (applause); Congressmembers Dina Titus -- (applause), Steven Horsford -- (applause), and Susie Lee. (Applause.) And I know Culinary 226 is in the house. (Applause.) (Inaudible) -- AUDIENCE: 226! 226! 226! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. AUDIENCE: 226! 226! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And the culinary union, as everyone in Nevada knows, they have helped lead the way in our country for workers' rights and workers' dignity. (Applause.) And I have to say, for years, I've been so proud to work by your side. When I was attorney general of California, we worked together to crack down on wage theft. (Applause.) When I was a United States senator, we fought together for paid family leave and medical leave. (Applause.) And earlier this year, right here in Vegas, we celebrated your historic contract win. (Applause.) And it is my promise to everyone here, when I am president, we will continue our fight for working families of America -- (applause) -- including to raise the minimum wage -- (applause) -- and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers. (Applause.) And, Nevada, today, I also bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. (Applause.) Joe. AUDIENCE: Joe! Joe! Joe! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We love Joe. AUDIENCE: We love Joe! We love Joe! We love Joe! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's great. That's great. And I know -- I'm going to tell him what you all just said. (Laughter.) And I know we are all so deeply grateful to Joe Biden for his lifetime of service to our nation -- (applause) -- and he's not done. And he's not done. So, as I said, it's so good to be back in Las Vegas. The last time I was here, I stopped by the practice for the Men's National Basketball Team before they headed out to the Olympics. (Applause.) And maybe you saw it on your phone, but just a few hours ago in Paris, they won the gold. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I got more for you. A few hours before that, our Women's National Soccer Team won the gold as well. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: USA. USA. That's right. So, in one sport after another, Team USA continues to make our nation proud. (Applause.) So much to celebrate. So much to celebrate. So, Nevada, we have 87 days until the election -- 87 days. And here's the thing -- AUDIENCE MEMBERS: We got your back! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: But here's the thing. Here's the thing. We know this will be a tight race until the very end, and so let's not pay too much attention to the polls, because we have some hard work ahead of us. But we like hard work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. (Applause.) And with your help this November, we will win. (Applause.) We will win. We will win. We will win. AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I know we are all clear -- toward that win, we are all clear about what we are up against. As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, district attorney. (Applause.) And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.) In those roles -- in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds -- (applause): predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain. So, Nevada, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.) (Laughs.) I do. I do. AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Whoa, whoa, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. The courts are going to take care of that. We just going to beat them in November. We'll beat them in November. (Applause.) We'll beat them in November. But I've certainly been dealing with people like him my entire career. For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Remember that. As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: As attorney general, I held Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Well -- (applause) -- Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud -- 34 counts. (Applause.) All of this is to say, in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his every day of the week -- every day of the week. (Applause.) That being said, let's make no mistake: This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It is about two different visions for our nation: one, ours, focused on the future; the other focused on the past. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: But we're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We are not going back. And we're not going back because, Nevada, we fight for the future -- (applause) -- a future with affordable health care, affordable childcare, and paid leave. (Applause.) We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy, where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth. (Applause.) We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families so they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead -- to get ahead. (Applause.) Because, look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. When I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes, and when I am president, I will continue that work to bring down prices. (Applause.) I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging, corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families, and -- (applause) -- and take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. (Applause.) Unlike Donald Trump, I will always -- I promise you -- put the middle class and working families first. (Applause.) Because, you see, Tim Walz and I may not appear to have a whole lot in common, but we have so much in common. And I'll tell you what he and I know: The middle class built the United States of America -- (applause) -- and when the middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.) And so, while we together work to move our nation forward, Donald Trump has a different plan. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Which I keep saying, I can't believe they put that in writing. (Laughter.) So, if he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And he intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I don't need to tell Nevada every day, because you feel the impact of extreme heat and drought. (Applause.) You know the climate crisis is real. But Donald Trump, well, he claims it's a hoax. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of this, if Donald Trump were to win in November -- he won't -- (applause) -- but if he were to win in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Think about that. To take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: You remember what that was like? Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes. Look, America has tried these failed policies before, and we are not -- AUDIENCE: Going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. We are not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: No. And we are going to move forward. We will move forward. (Applause.) And in moving forward, we will take on the biggest issues facing our nation. For example, we will address the issue of immigration. (Applause.) I was the attorney of a border state -- attorney general of a border state. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers who came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won. (Applause.) We know our immigration system is broken, and we know what it takes to fix it: comprehensive reform that includes, yes, strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship. (Applause.) But Donald Trump doesn't want to fix this problem. He talks a big game about a lot of things. (Laughter.) But he talks a big game about border security, but he does not walk the walk. Earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades, but Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought it would help him win an election. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, when I am president, I will sign that bill into law. (Applause.) Nevada, ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.) Across our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault on hard-won, hard-fought freedoms and fundamental rights: the -- the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- (applause) -- and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.) A fight for freedom. And on that last point, we all know how we got here. When he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- because he intended for them to undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. Now in more than 20 states, there is a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And be sure, if he were to win, he would sign a national abortion ban, which would outlaw abortion in every state, even Nevada. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: But we are not going to let that happen -- (applause) -- because we trust women. (Applause.) And when I am president of the United States and Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms, I will sign it into law. (Applause.) So, I know the folks who are here. I know the people of Nevada; you are Battle Born. (Applause.) You are Battle Born. And if Donald Trump wants to pick a fight over our most fundamental freedoms, we say: Bring it on. Bring it on. (Applause.) Bring it on. AUDIENCE: Bring it on! Bring it on! Bring it on! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because we're ready. We're ready. So, Nevada, generations -- generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now the baton is in our hands. (Applause.) Each and every one of us. So, we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and red flag laws. (Applause.) So much is on the line. So much is on the line in this election. And understand this is not 2016. This is not 2020. This time around, the stakes are even higher, and that's because last month, the Supreme Court of the United States basically told -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- the former president that going forward, he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: But -- but think about what that means. Think about what that means. So, Donald Trump has vowed to be a dictator on day one if reelected. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He said he will weaponize, essentially, the Department of Justice against his political enemies. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And even called for the, quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let us be very clear: Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right. That's right. We know what we stand for as Americans. And, you know, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. (Applause.) That is how we preserve the promise of America. And think about it, after all, the promise of America is what makes it possible for Tim Walz and me to be together on this stage today. (Applause.) Think about that. Think about that. Think about it. Two middle-class kids. One a daughter of Oakland, California -- (applause) -- who was raised by a working mother. I had a summer job at McDonald's. (Applause.) The other, a son of the Nebraska plains, who grew up working on a farm. (Applause.) Think about it. Think about it. Only in America is it possible that the two of them would be running together all the way to the White House. (Applause.) Only in America. Only in America. So, look -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I love you back. (Applause.) I love you back. So, look, we are -- together, we are running this campaign on behalf of all Americans -- (applause) -- from red states to blue states, from the heartland to the coast. And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. (Applause.) All Americans. So, Nevada, ultimately, in this election, I believe we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in? A country of chaos, fear, and hate? AUDIENCE: Noo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Or a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law? (Applause.) And the beauty -- and the beauty of our democracy -- here's the thing. The beauty of our democracy is we each -- each person has the power -- each person has the power to answer that question. (Applause.) The power is with the people. The power is with the people. (Applause.) It's with the people. And so, in the next 87 days, we need you to use your power -- (laughs) -- (applause) -- to knock on doors, register folks to vote, and make your voices heard. (Applause.) So, Nevada, today, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.) And when we fight -- AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win! God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373794",30953,"GOVERNOR WALZ: Wow! (Applause.) Hey, he- -- hello, Arizona! (Laughs.) (Applause.) Wow. Hey -- AUDIENCE: Coach! Coach! Coach! GOVERNOR WALZ: (Bows.) Yeah. Wow. Well, you might have seen, a few people showed up in Philadelphia the other night. (Applause.) And then 10,000-plus walked into a field in western Wisconsin. (Applause.) And then on Wednesday, the largest crowd of the campaign showed up in Detroit, Michigan. (Applause.) But Arizona just couldn't leave it alone, could you? (Laughs.) (Applause.) Wow. You know, it's not as if anybody cares about crowd sizes or anything, so -- (laughter and applause). Wow. Let me begin -- let me begin by giving a few thanks to some people here and a few dear folks to us. First of all, I want to thank Arizona for sharing Senator Mark Kelly and Gabby Giffords with the rest of the country. (Applause.) Gabby was a classmate of mine in '06, and they are both national treasures. Thank you, Arizona. (Applause.) I also had the privilege of serving with -- with Congressman Gallego. And I have to tell you -- (applause) -- he -- he was an amazing colleague. And I have to tell you, he's going to be an amazing senator, but we get it -- we -- we get -- (applause) -- we get a twofer with Ruben, because we know who is never going to be a United States senator. (Applause.) To all the local elected officials, thank you. But the most important thank you to each and every one of you. (Applause.) Look, you took time out of your busy lives. You found babysitters; you took time off work. You walked for miles. And look, I'm a Minnesotan; I'm like a damn snowman. I'm melting here. (Laughter.) There's a -- we walk on water half the year in Minnesota, it's so damn cold. But -- but not you. You came. And you came into this space with neighbors. (Applause.) And you came here for one beautiful, simple reason: You love this democracy. (Applause.) I'll - I'll tell you what -- AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! GOVERNOR WALZ: Wow, wow, wow. Well, I couldn't be prouder to stand with you, and I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket. (Applause.) You know what is at the end of this little journey? Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States. (Applause.) This is a leader who wakes up every day on the side of the American people. This is -- (applause) -- she will take on the predators. She will take on the fraudsters, she will take on the transnational gangs, and she will stand up to the corporate interests and put middle America first. (Applause.) And -- and she's been effective. She's been willing to reach across the aisle no matter what just to make sure it improves people's lives. And I'll have to tell you, I know a little something about commitment to people. Some of you heard this. I was born in a small town in Nebraska. And we talk about small towns. (Applause.) These are those Nebraskans that moved out here for the winter, so -- (laughter). But, look, small town was all about community. My mom and dad, they taught us to show some care to your neighbors, show some generosity, work towards a common good, be a decent human being to your neighbors. (Applause.) My dad -- and some of you know him in here; you had him -- a chain-smoking, Korean War-era veteran, cared about his community. But two days after I turned 17, he took me down to join the Army National Guard. And for 24 years, I proudly wore that uniform. (Applause.) And I'm proud of that service, but what my nation gave my dad and millions of others and me was an opportunity to use the G.I. Bill to get a college education. (Applause.) My dad was a teacher. My brothers and sisters and I -- (applause) -- my brothers and sisters and I all became teachers. (Applause.) And we married teachers. (Applause.) I had the privilege of teaching high school social studies for 20 years -- (applause) -- and, you might have heard, coaching a state championship football team. So --- (applause). AUDIENCE: Coach! Coach! Coach! GOVERNOR WALZ: Now if the Vikings could just win, that would be the -- (laughter) -- (inaudible). Well, look -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: (Laughs.) That worked better near Green Bay, I'll tell you. So -- (laughter) -- Look, it was my students -- it was my students who encouraged me to run. They saw in me what I hoped to instill in them: a commitment to a common good, the belief -- the true belief that one person, one of us in here, can make a difference in somebody's life. (Applause.) I -- I wasn't very politically savvy, because I did not know it when I decided to run for Congress that there had been one other Democrat elected in that district since 1892. But my neighbors believed, and they graced me with an opportunity to serve them in the United States Congress for 12 years. (Applause.) And I'm proud of the work I did as ranking member on the Veterans Affairs Committee, working on the Agriculture Committee. (Applause.) And I worked hand in hand with Republicans to make sure that we were crafting legislation that improved the lives of veterans and people all across this country. (Applause.) I learned how to compromise without compromising my values. (Applause.) And as governor of the great state of Minnesota, I brought all of those experiences -- I brought all of those experiences to the challenges facing the state of Minnesota. (Applause.) This idea about a common good, this idea about something bigger than ourselves, this idea of kindness, generosity and compassion that this building -- which I have been told, by the way, might be the largest political gathering in the history of Arizona. (Applause.) I -- I think it's -- I think it's safe to say Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than we do. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: First and foremost -- and be very clear about this -- he doesn't know the first thing about service. AUDIENCE: Nooo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: It's hard to provide service when you're too busy serving only yourself. (Applause.) Again and again and again, Donald Trump weakens our country to strengthen his own hands. You've watched him mock our laws. You watched him sow chaos and division at every opportunity. And that's to say nothing of his record as president. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: As governors -- as governors, he froze during COVID and pitted us in a hunger game against our neighbors to try and find basic lifesaving needs. And because of him, our neighbors died. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: By failing to address COVID, he drove the economy into the ground. And let's be very clear, the statistics and the facts are clear about this: Violent crime was up under Donald Trump. (Applause.) And we don't even have to count his crimes in that to make it up. So, still. (Applause.) Look -- those -- AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! GOVERNOR WALZ: Better yet, beat the hell out of him at the ballot box. (Applause.) Beat the hell out of him at the ballot box. Look, you and I, especially the gray hairs in the crowd, we know -- we know our relatives. Republicans used to be the people talking about freedom. Not this group. When they talk about freedom, it means that the government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: Look, in Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make. We may- -- we maybe wouldn't make the same choices, but we respect them. And I know in Minnesota and in Arizona and places across this country, you know what makes society work best -- is when you learn a golden rule: Mind your own damn business. Mind your own damn business. (Applause.) We don't need it. I don't -- I don't need you telling me what books to read. I don't need you telling me about what religion we worship. And I sure the heck don't need you to tell me about my family. (Applause.) Look, this -- this one is personal for me. This one is personal for me about IVF and reproductive care. When my wife and I -- my wife of 30 years, because, yes, we share family values; we just make our own damn choices about our family. (Applause.) But when we wanted to have children, we went through years of fertility treatment. And I remember it was -- like it was yesterday, just waiting for good news. And then the phone would ring, and you would be tensed up. And then you would hear that the treatments had failed. It was a -- it would blot out the sun that you just wanted something so beautiful and so simple to have a child. And then, one day -- and it wasn't by chance when that news came and we welcomed our daughter into the world -- (applause) -- we named her Hope. We named her Hope. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Hope! Hope! Hope! GOVERNOR WALZ: I'm not crying; you're crying. So -- (laughter). When Vice President Harris and I talk about freedom, we're very clear. We mean the freedom to make your own health care decisions -- (applause) -- and for all of our children to be free to go to school without worrying they'll be shot dead in their classroom. (Applause.) And in Minnesota, believe me, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in commonsense gun violence laws. (Applause.) I remind my colleagues, when I was in Congress -- Ruben could tell this story -- for three years in a row, I was the top gun in the congressional trap shoot, so we can shoot better than them, too. Just, by the way, so -- (laughter). When Vice President Harris talks about freedom, it's when freedom is when education is a ticket to the middle class -- (applause) -- not crippling student loan debt. (Applause.) And this building and what we believe in -- we are people that settle our political differences not through violence but through voting. (Applause.) It's a simple -- AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote! GOVERNOR WALZ: Imagine every person in here is going to vote and every person in here is going to get 10 other people to vote, and here's -- (applause) -- and let's just go ahead and not go through this thing that it's so close. Let's just win big, people. Let's just win big. (Applause.) That's our choice. How often -- how often you get a choice so simple that this is going to decide the direction of our country? We have 87 days to decide the direction we're going to go. And I've been saying it: We can do anything for 87 days. Anything. (Applause.) And my mantra is -- and, look, you can see it on me over the last five days -- we'll sleep when we're dead. We'll sleep when we're dead. (Applause.) Not now. Not now. Look, you know it and I know it, but I think we need to be reminded. You know exactly what Donald Trump's plans are. You know which direction he's taking us. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: Don't believe this guy. Don't believe -- I -- that's -- like, listen, no one in here believes this guy. So, anyway. (Laughter.) But don't believe it when he's playing dumb about this Project 2025. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: He knows exactly what it'll do. They are not playing. They wrote their plan out. But just like they're getting arrogant about it, they're saying the quiet stuff out loud. It'll take our freedoms. It will rig the economy for the super-rich. It will underfund veterans. And you know that if he goes back again, he's not only going to let go where he left off, it is going to be much, much, much worse. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: So, look, rising costs, pulling health care from us -- you know, the whole routine. Look, I get this too. I know I'm preaching to the choir -- a damn big and beautiful choir -- (applause) -- but practice is over, people. The choir needs to sing. The choir needs to sing. (Applause.) Trump stopped fighting for your family. He doesn't give a damn. And his running mate shares the same dangerous, twisted, backward agenda. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: Yeah. Ev- -- every kid -- every kid in my class of 25 studied at Yale, had their career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then writes a book trashing the very people who raised you. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: I've said it. It wasn't a name; it was an observation. These guys come up with the weirdest damn ideas that you will ever imagine. (Applause.) You know it's true. But here's the good news. We know the stakes. We know who they are. When they told us, we believed them. We know what's coming. But here's the big thing about it is: That's a reality that's not going to happen because of the people in this building and millions across the country. (Applause.) This is a campaign about the future. We know what's there. We know what can come. We're not people who are afraid of the future; we shape the future. (Applause.) Kamala Harris believes in the freedom to make your own choices. She believes in the opportunity for every single person to enter the middle class. And she believes something so beautiful: She believes in the promise of America -- the promise of America. (Applause.) So, I want to say thank you, Madam Vice President, for the trust you've placed in me. And I want to say something else that this incredible leader, this incredible woman has brought to this fight. (Applause.) She -- she has brought back compassion and decency and humor and joy to our politics. (Applause.) So, Arizona -- Arizona, bring that joy with you. Bring those smiles. Bring that positive future as you join me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (""Freedom"" by Beyoncé is played.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Arizona! (Applause.) Good evening. Oh, my goodness. Good evening. (Laughs.) (Applause.) We're going to do this. Good evening. Good -- (laughs) -- thank you all. Thank you. Can we hear it for Tim Walz? (Applause.) Oh, my goodness. Oh, it's good to be back in Arizona. Good evening, everyone. (Applause.) Oh, my goodness. Thank you all so very much. Oh, it is good to be back. Let me just say -- let me -- let me just start by thanking everyone who is here. Thank you all so very much. (Applause.) All of us, we're going to do this. We're going to do this. We are going to do this. (Applause.) Yes, we are. And I want to thank all of the incredible leaders who are here, including Congressman Greg Stanton -- (applause); your next United States senator, Congressman Ruben Gallego -- (applause); and my dear friend, United States Senator Mark Kelly. (Applause.) And let me just say, as Arizona knows, Mark is an extraordinary leader who has dedicated his life to the service of our nation as a fighter pilot, as an astronaut, and as a member of the United States Congress. And he has given so much to our country. He always fights for the people of Arizona. And I am so grateful, Mark, for your friendship and your leadership. (Applause.) And, of course, the -- a phenomenal congresswoman, Gabby Giffords. (Applause.) There are also an incredible group of mayors with us today, Mayor Kate Gallego -- (applause); Mayor Corey Woods -- (applause); and Arizona co-chair of Republicans for Harris, Mayor John Giles. (Applause.) So, today, I also bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Joe! Joe! Joe! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation. And we thank Joe Biden each and every day -- (applause) -- for all he is and all he has done and all he has yet to do. Let us thank him always. (Applause.) So, Arizona, this has been a big week. (Applause.) On Monday, I officially became the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. (Applause.) And on Tuesday, I announced my running mate in this campaign, Governor Tim Walz. (Applause.) And as you all just heard, Tim has a great record as governor of the great state of Minnesota. And to those who know him best, Tim goes by a few more titles besides governor. To his wife, Gwen -- AUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Inaudible.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: So -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. So, Tim -- Tim, we know him by -- we know him by ""Governor,"" but you'll soon get to know his wife, Gwen, to whom -- AUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: You know what? Hold on a second. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on, everybody. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Here's the thing: We are all in here together. I'm s- -- I'm told, an extraordinary number of folks who are here together because we love our country. We're here to fight for our democracy -- (applause) -- which includes respecting the voices that I think that we are hearing from. And let me just say this on topic of what I think I'm hearing over there. Let me just speak to that for a moment, and then I'm going to get back to the business at hand. (Applause.) So, let me say, I have been clear: Now is the time to get a ceasefire deal and get the hostage deal done. (Applause.) done. Now is the time. And the president and I are working around the clock every day to get that ceasefire deal done and bring the hostages home. (Applause.) So, I respect your voices, but we are here to now talk about this race in 2024. (Applause.) So, Tim Walz -- so, let's just say this. Besides being governor, the thing I've come to learn about Tim Walz that you have known and may learn more: He's an extraordinary person. He's known by many titles. To his wife Gwen, he is husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is Dad. To the people of Southern Minnesota for 12 years, he was Congressman. To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. (Applause.) And to his former high school football players, he was Coach. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Coach! Coach! Coach! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And in 88 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by a new title: vice president of the United States. (Applause.) So, it's so good to be back in Arizona, and I thank you all for turning out today. This is an extraordinary, extraordinary thing. (Applause.) And, Arizona, I'll also this -- say this, as exciting as this is, we cannot lose sight of a really important fact: We are definitely running as the underdog. We are the underdog. We are out in great numbers, but we got a lot of work to do. And this is going to be hard work, but I know we like hard work. Hard work is good work for all of us. Hard work is good work, and we will do it with joy. (Applause.) And I know we are all clear about what we are up against. As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, I was an elected United States senator. (Applause.) Before that -- before that, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, an elected district attorney. (Applause.) And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.) So, I took on, in these roles, perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- fraudsters who ripped off consumers -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- scammers who broke the rules for personal gain. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, Arizona, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.) I do. In fact, I've been dealing with people like him my entire career. For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: As a pres- -- as a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: As attorney general, I held Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud -- 34 counts. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, all of this -- yeah, the courts will deal with that. We going to win in November. (Laughs.) We going to win in November. (Applause.) We'll handle that too. So -- but all of this is to say: In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his every day of the week. (Applause.) Every day of the week. But make no mistake, that being said, our campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It is about -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I love you back. (Applause.) Our campaign -- our campaign is about two different visions for our nation. One, ours, focused on the future. The other, focused on the past. And, Arizona, we -- we fight for the future. (Applause.) A future with affordable health care, affordable child care, and paid leave. (Applause.) A future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build wealth. (Applause.) Here with us today, I know we have a number of Native leaders. And as president, I will tell you -- (applause) -- I will always honor tribal sovereignty and respect tribal self-determination -- (applause) -- and fight for a future where every Native person can realize their aspirations and every Native community is a place of opportunity. (Applause.) We here -- we believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families -- (applause) -- so that they have the chance not just to get by, but to get ahead. (Applause.) Because, look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it. When I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes. And when I am president, I will continue that work to bring down prices. I will take on -- (applause) -- I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging. I will take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families. (Applause.) I will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. (Applause.) And all of this is to say, unlike Donald Trump, I will always put the middle class and working families first. (Applause.) Because you see, Coach Walz and I know the middle class built the United States of America. (Applause.) And when the middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.) And while we work to move our nation forward, look, Donald Trump, be very clear, intends to move us backward. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Just look -- and we're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not gong back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we're not going back. We are not going back. We're going back. No. But just look -- look -- look at his -- you know, Tim talked about it. Look at his Project 2025 agenda. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's 900-plus pages. I can't believe they put that thing in writing, by the way. (Laughter.) But when you look at it, when you read it, you will see Project 2025 is a plan to weaken the middle class. If he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give a tax break to billionaires and big corporations. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And, Arizona, every day you feel the impact of extreme heat and drought. You know this crisis is real. He calls it a hoax. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of all of this, if Donald Trump wins in November, he intends -- he intends to end the Affordable Care Act -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was? AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Remember what that was? AUDIENCE MEMBER: He won't win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: He won't win. You're right. (Applause.) He won't win. AUDIENCE: He won't win! He won't win! He won't win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win. We will win. AUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And -- and part of why we are going to win is because we remember and we are smart and we know what's happening and we're not falling for the gaslighting and we're not falling for the okey-doke. (Applause.) That's why. So, look, America has tried so many of those failed policies before, and, like we all know, we're not going back. (Applause.) We -- we will move forward and take on the biggest issues facing our nation. For example, the issue of immigration. So, I was attorney general of a border state. I went after the transnational gangs, the drug cartels, and human traffickers. (Applause.) I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won. (Applause.) So I know what I'm talking about. We know our immigration system is broken, and we know what it takes to fix it: comprehensive reform that includes strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship. (Applause.) But Donald Trump does not want to fix this problem. Be clear about that. He has no interest or desire to actually fix the problem. He talks a big game about border security, but he does not walk the walk. Earlier this year -- everybody here knows, earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades, but Donald Trump tanked the deal -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- because he thought by doing that it would help him win an election. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: But when I am president, I will sign the bill. (Applause.) So, Arizona, ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.) Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence -- (applause); the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- (applause); and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.) And on that last point, understand how we got here. When he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- with the intention that they would overturn and undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. And now, in over 20 states in our nation, there is a Trump abortion ban. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Many, like Arizona, with no exceptions even for rape or incest. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And just yesterday in a press conference, we got a fresh reminder of what Donald Trump's Project 2025 agenda would do. It would ban medication abortion in every state. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: But we are not going to let that happen -- AUDIENCE: Nooo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- because we trust women. (Applause.) And when I am president of the United States and when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms for every woman In America, I will sign it into law. (Applause.) So, listen, here's the thing that we all know -- here's the thing we all know: Generations -- generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now, the baton is in our hands -- (applause) -- each and every one of us. So, we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to vote act. (Applause.) And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and red flag laws. (Applause.) So much is on the line in this election. And understand, this is not 2016 and this is not 2020. You know, this time around, the stakes are even higher. And that's because last month, the United States Supreme Court basically just told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud, that going forward, he was -- he will be effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: But -- but think about what that means. Think about what that means in this election. Think about what that means. He's been effectively told he will be immune if he's back in the White House. Think about what that means when you remember Donald Trump has openly vowed, if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- that he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Remember that he even called for th,e quote, ""termination"" of the Constitution of the United States. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Understand what this means. And let us be very clear: Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the United States president. (Applause.) Never again. Never again. So, Arizona, it all comes down to this. We are here because we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right. We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That's -- that's how we preserve the promise of America. And after all, the promise of America is what makes it possible for Governor Walz and me to be on the same stage together. Because think: two middle class kids. One, a daughter of Oakland, California -- (applause) -- who was raised by a working mother, had a summer job at McDonald's. (Applause.) The other, a son of Nebraska plains, who grew up working on a farm. Think about it. Only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House. (Applause.) Only in America. Only in America. So, we, together, all of us -- we're running this campaign on behalf of all Americans, from red states to blue states, from the heartland to the coast. And when we are elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. (Applause.) All Americans. So, Arizona, ultimately, in this election, I do believe we each -- each one of us, we face a question. That question being: What kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of chaos, fear, and hate -- AUDIENCE: Nooo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- or a country of freedom, compassion, and rul","e of law? (Applause.) And the beauty -- the beauty of our democracy -- the beauty of our democracy is that we each have the power to answer that question. Each one of us in a democracy has the power to answer that question. The power is with the people. (Applause.) And in the next, then, 88 days, we need you to use your power. (Applause.) We need you to knock on some doors. (Applause.) We need you to register folks to vote. (Applause.) We need you to energize, to mobilize, to organize, and to make your voices heard. (Applause.) So, Arizona, I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.) And when we fight -- AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win. (Applause.) God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you. (Applause.)","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373792",11704,"GOVERNOR WALZ: Wow. (Applause.) Wow. Well, thank you, Mr. President. The American worker has no greater friend than you and your members. Thank you for what you do every single day. (Applause.) And to the sisters and brothers here in this spot, as a union member, thank you for the privilege. This is holy ground for unions, Local 900. And to be here and know, for any union member understands what this place stands for and what it means. And so, thank you for having me here. And to each and every one of you, thank you for the privilege of walking that picket line with you last year. Thank you for allowing us to lift up our voices. And in Minnesota, the work that you did -- it didn't just benefit UAW workers, it benefited all workers. (Applause.) So, I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket and couldn't be prouder to stand with UAW. (Applause.) Think about this: 89 wake-ups. I've been saying this. Eight-nine days -- we can do anything for 89 days. Telling people, ""Sleep when you're dead."" We got work to do. Right now -- (applause) -- right now, 89 days to make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Yay. Look -- AUDIENCE: We've got your back! We've got your back! We've got your back! GOVERNOR WALZ: Yeah. Think -- think about -- think about this leader that's very simple. She stands on the side of the American people and the American worker. She's the one who took on the predators, the fraudsters, the transnational gangs. And she's the one that stands up against the billionaires and the corporate greed that bring -- that bring -- this is who it is. (Applause.) And she has a long record of delivering for union -- union members and organized labor. All right. Everybody in this room knows -- and I keep saying this. This is a bit of preaching to the choir, but the choir needs to sing right now. (Applause.) The choir needs to sing. We know -- we know that unions built the middle class. The rest of America has to. You know who doesn't believe that? Donald Trump. He sees the world entirely differently. And it really starts with this, when I look at community and neighbors and unions. And the word that Shawn said, ""unity"" -- this guy doesn't know the first thing about unity or service. He's too busy serving himself. Again and again and again you've seen it. He put himself above us. He weakened our country to strengthen his own hand. He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division. That says nothing about how he dealt with as president. We lived through it. We lived through it. He froze in the face of COVID, and our neighbors died because of it. And by doing nothing about COVID, he drove this economy into the ground. And I want to be very clear about this, because there's a lot of lies that happened when they're here. Violent crime was up when Donald Trump was president. Without even counting his crimes, it was still up. It was still up. (Laughter and applause.) So, this is very simple. You know it, and it's going to take a heck of a lot of hard work, but this election is a simple choice: What direction and what's our country going to look like? What direction are we going in? You know it. We've said it. Donald Trump is going to take it backwards. AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're not going back! GOVERNOR WALZ: He's going to -- we aren't going back. We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! GOVERNOR WALZ: It isn't happening. We're not going back. (Addressing Shawn Fain.) They know. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! GOVERNOR WALZ: Look, and this thing of -- of playing dumb while he sits on the planes with these billionaires and says he do- -- ""I don't know anything about Project 2025. I just fly on the planes with them."" You know what it's going to do. One of the goals of that, plain and simple -- and they know this; this has been going on forever -- get rid of labor unions and get rid of the voices that we bring. They can do whatever the hell they want then. If Trump's -- returns, he's going to learn something from the last time. He didn't get the job done. This time, it will be far, far worse, and he will get the job done and make sure that we can't organize collectively to improve our lives. That's what is coming. So, whether he cuts the middle class, makes it more difficult to own a home, whether he repeals the Affordable Care Act so you can't get health insurance are the things that you know they talk about -- gutting Social Security and Medicare. You know what? When you got a billion dollars, you don't give a damn about your Social Security check. But if you're like my mom and you depend on the Social Security check as your sole income, it's pretty damn important. (Applause.) And I've been saying it and you've been hearing me say it: They will ban abortion across this country no matter what Congress says. AUDIENCE MEMBER: My body, my choice! GOVERNOR WALZ: Now look -- damn right, it is. And I don't know why this is so simple -- or so difficult for these people to understand. You know how things work really well in life and really well with your neighbors and really well in communities? When you mind your own damn business, things work better. (Applause.) Stay out of our business. Stay out of our business. He's not fighting for you. He doesn't know you. He doesn't care about your family. And his running mate is just as dangerous and backward as he is. So, look, we know who they are. The choir is ready to sing. This campaign is about the future -- your future. Vice President Harris sure knows that. She grew up in a middle-class family. She goes to work every day making sure families are on the front so that they can get ahead and they can get into the middle class. She believes in something so simple and so beautiful. And when we go to these rallies, I say it too. People drive, they sit in the sun, they get there, they stand next to their neighbor for one simple reason. And just like the vice president says, they believe in their hearts in the promise of America. They believe it. They believe it. (Applause.) So, sisters and brothers in the UAW, how great is this going to be? Please join me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, UAW. (Applause.) Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Oh, it is good to be in the house of labor. It is good to be in the house of labor. (Applause.) Thank you, all. Please have a seat. Please have a seat. Okay. So, let me just say, first of all, can we hear it again for Tim Walz? (Applause.) Isn't he spectacular? You know, I have to tell -- people have been asking, ""Well -- well, what do you and Tim Walz have in common?"" And I said, ""Well, you know, a whole lot. A whole lot."" You know, we grew up the same way. We grew up in a community of people, you know -- I mean, he grew up in -- in Nebraska; me, Oakland, California -- (laughs) -- seemingly worlds apart. But the same people raised us: good people; hard-working people; people who had pride in their hard work; you know, people who had pride in knowing that we were a community of people who looked out for each other -- you know, raised by a community of folks who understood that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down. It's based on who you lift up. (Applause.) GOVERNOR WALZ: Amen. Amen. THE VICE PRESIDENT: And, you know, there's some perversion that's happened in our country in the last several years where there's a suggestion that somehow strength is about making people feel small, making people feel alone. But isn't that the very opposite of what we know -- unions know to be strength? It's about the collective. It's about understanding no one should ever be made to fight alone, that we are all in this together. (Applause.) You know, you know why I fought my entire career for unions and labor? Because I understand the concept -- and the noble concept -- behind collective bargaining. And here it is. Here it is: fairness. Fairness. It's about saying, ""Hey, in a negotiation, don't we all believe the outcome should be fair?"" I mean, who could disagree with that? The outcome should be fair. It should be fair, right? (Applause.) But when you're talking about the individual and a big company, and you're requiring that one individual to nego- -- negotiate against a big company -- GOVERNOR WALZ: Yeah. THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- how's that outcome going to be fair? So, collective bargaining is about saying: Let the collective come together around a common experience, which, at its core, is about dignity and the dignity of labor. (Applause.) GOVERNOR WALZ: That's right. THE VICE PRESIDENT: And then let the people come together to negotiate so you make the balance, and then the outcome will be fair. And isn't that what we're talking about in this here election? We're saying we just want fairness. We want dignity for all people. We want to recognize the right all people have to freedom and liberty, to make choices -- especially those that are about heart and home -- and not have their government telling them what to do. (Applause.) Our campaign is about saying we trust the people, we see the people, we know the people. You know one of the things I love about our country? We are a nation of people who believe in those ideals that were foundational to what made us so special as a nation. We believe in those ideals. And the sisters and brothers of labor have always fought for those ideals -- always fought for those ideals. And we know we are a work in progress. We haven't yet quite reached all of those ideals, but we will die trying because we love our country and we believe in who we are. (Applause.) And that's what our campaign is about. We love our country. We believe in our country. We believe in each other. We believe in the collective. We're not falling for these folks who are trying to divide us, trying to separate us, trying to pull us apart. That's not where the strength lies. AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: And there is that. (Laughter.) And so, I say to all the members of UAW -- and Shawn Fain is the first who I talked to about this -- I am so deeply honored, as a lifelong supporter of union labor, for Tim and I to have the endorsement of UAW. (Applause.) So deeply honored because you walk your walk -- you walk your walk. And what we know -- like we have talked about, we got 89 days to get this done. You know, the one thing about all of us is we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. The thing that we like about hard work is we have fun doing hard work because we know what we stand for. And that's a big part of this campaign. You know, when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. (Applause.) We know what we stand for. And we stand for the people. And we stand for the dignity of work. And we stand for freedom. We stand for justice. We stand for equality. (Applause.) GOVERNOR WALZ: That's right. That's right. THE VICE PRESIDENT: And so, we will fight for all of it. And the bottom line about UAW is that I also know -- and I'll say to all the friends watching: Look, even if you're not a member of a union, you better thank unions -- (applause) -- for that five-day workweek. You better thank unions for that eight-hour workday. You better thank unions for that vacation time. (Applause.) So, I'm here to say thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you to the sisters and brothers of UAW for all you are and all we will do over these next 89 days. (Applause.) God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. We're going to get this done. (Applause.)","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373790",28865,"GOVERNOR WALZ: Wow. (Applause.) Woo! Wow. Wow. (Applause.) Thank you. A big thank you to Adam. I think we can all agree, our future is pretty bright. Thank you, Adam. (Applause.) And hello, Michigan! (Laughs.) (Applause.) You know, we -- we Minnesotans -- you probably know this -- we're a -- we're a stoic people, a people of few words. (Laughter.) But holy hell, can you throw a party here in Michigan, so -- (applause). Wow. I want to take a moment to acknowledge a few friends, folks that I've gotten to know. And let's be very clear, this is someone who I consider my dearest friend and someone who taught all the other governors how to fix the damn roads: Governor Whitmer. (Applause.) You have got a treasure in Michigan, and -- and I'll tell you what, we share a lot between us in the Upper Midwest. We share -- Oh, we need some water. We have somebody down. We need some water. Medic. We need a medic right here. You got somebody here. You got him? All right. We got a medic on the way. Thank you for caring for your neighbors. (Applause.) Thank you for showing what Michigan does. Look, we share a lot of things. That's one of them. We're neighbors, and we're not weird, that's for sure. But -- (applause) -- but I got to tell you, something else we share is a care for the incredible natural resources. We in the Upper Midwest, in our states, we care for 20 percent of the world's fresh water in those Great Lakes. (Applause.) And the -- the Great Lakes have no better friend than your senator, Senator Stabenow. (Applause.) I got some members of Congress I had the privilege of serving with and some that are new to that place. Let's be clear, we got to put gavels in the hands of these Democratic representatives so that we can get some work done. (Applause.) My friend Dan Kildee; Debbie Dingell; Haley Stevens; Elissa Slotkin; Hillary Scholten -- (applause); Representive Thanedar, I believe, just won a -- in a primary year; Wayne County Executive Warren Evans; and the chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, Lavora Barnes -- thank you. (Applause.) And I want to just take a moment. It's been a pretty interesting 24 hours for me, I'll have to be honest. (Applause.) And I -- I don't know what it -- how I could explain to you walking into that arena in Philly or that field out in Wisconsin or right here to what I have been told is the largest rally of the campaign in here. (Applause.) And look -- and look, this is a place full of working folks, students, folks who care. And I -- think about this, you came out here early, found a place to park, stood in the sun, sat here and wait, and you did it. You did it for one simple and eloquent and beautiful reason: You love this country. (Applause.) You love this country. I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket and to help make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States. (Applause.) Every day of her life, Vice President Harris fights for the American people. She's taken on predators, fraudsters, and transnational gangs. You heard it. She stood up to powerful corporate interests, and she has never hesitated to reach across the aisle to try and find some common solutions. And she has done it, and this is what we know: All the things that make me mad about those other guys and all the things they do wrong, the one thing that I will not forgive them for is they're trying to steal the joy from this country. They try and steal the joy. (Applause.) But you know what? You know what? Our next president brings the joy. She emanates the joy. (Applause.) I know a little something about that commitment to people. I was born in a small town of 400 people in Nebraska, and community was the way of life. My mom and dad taught me you showed generosity to your neighbors and you worked for a common good amongst them. At 17, I joined the Army National Guard. (Applause.) And for the next 24 years, it was a privilege to wear the uniform of this country, and -- (applause) -- and just as it did for my dad, a Korean War-era veteran, and millions of others, I used the G.I. Bill to get a college education. (Applause.) Followed a bit in my dad's footsteps -- he was a teacher. (Applause.) My brothers and sisters were teachers. (Applause.) And they married teachers. (Applause.) I had the privilege of teaching high school social studies -- (applause) -- and I coached the football team. (Applause.) We did win a state championship. I tell you that because ""don't ever close the yearbook"" is my pro tip to you. (Laughter.) My students are the ones who encouraged me to run for office. I never thought much about it. But they saw -- they saw in me what I hope to instill in them: a commitment to the common good, a true belief that one person truly can make a difference -- can make a difference in the world. (Applause.) I lived in a district where -- I didn't know this at the time -- only one other Democrat since 1892 had won that district. And on that election night, my neighbors graced me with the opportunity to go to the United States Congress and represent them. (Applause.) I learned how to compromise without compromising my values. I learned how to work across the aisle to get good things done for people. And now as governor of Minnesota, I bring those experiences together so we can tackle some of those hard problems: inequities, climate change, all of the things that we care about. (Applause.) Now, we got a lot of shared values in this room. By the way, is labor in the room? (Applause.) This might be my chance to use it. AUDIENCE: UAW! UAW! UAW! GOVERNOR WALZ: Yeah! (Claps.) AUDIENCE: UAW! UAW! UAW! GOVERNOR WALZ: We know who built the middle class, but here's the deal. What we know is, Donald Trump -- he sees the world a bit differently than we see the world. And I've been saying it: He doesn't know the first thing about service, because he's way too busy serving himself. This is a big difference. Again and again, he does things that weakens our country only to strengthen his own hand. He mocks our laws, he sows chaos and division amongst the public, and that's to say nothing about his record as president. That -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) (Laughter.) GOVERNOR WALZ: He is that. He is that. Look, we had the worst crisis of a generation, and he froze during COVID. (Applause.) People lost their lives because of that. He drove the economy into the ground. And make no mistake, violent crime was up during Donald Trump's presidency. (Applause.) And that's not even counting the crimes he committed, so -- (applause). Some of the -- some of the gray-hairs in here remember a Republican Party that used to actually talk about freedom. These guys, when they talk about freedom, it means the government has the freedom to invade your exam room with your doctor. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: Now, I know -- look, that -- we got a lot of commonalities. And I'll say this: As an NFC North guy, Vikings fans are proud of the Lions. I will say that. (Laughs.) I will say that. (Applause.) But in Minnesota, we respect our neighbors' personal choices. We may not agree with them or make them from ourself, but I've been saying this -- you all know it -- our golden rule is: Mind your own damn business. Just mind your own business. (Applause.) It's amazing what minding your own damn business does to make things work better. (Applause.) Don't like a book? Don't read it. (Laughter and applause.) Is there anybody in America sitting around in a bar, a bunch of people talking and say, ""You know what we need in this country? We need to ban 'Animal Farm.' That's the first thing that you can do."" Nobody says that. (Laughter.) But you know what? It would be funny if it wasn't so dangerous, because then they start thinking about things like IVF and banning IVF. And I have to tell you, this is very personal for my family. When my wife and I decided to have children, we went through years of fertility treatments. I remember every time the phone rang, I'd catch my breath, I'd feel nervousness, and then it would be a crushing feeling when they told us that the treatments didn't work. The agony of that I can feel to this day. But I can also feel some joy in this, because it wasn't by chance, as I say this, when our daughter -- and we finally conceived -- and our daughter was born, we didn't hesitate at all. We named her Hope. We named her Hope. (Applause.) But I do have to tell you something about hope -- my wife always tells me this: It's not a damn plan. We can't hope we beat this guy. We can't hope that things get better. We go out and work our butts off to make sure it happens. (Applause.) So, when our next president walks out here and she talks about freedom, she means the freedom to make your own health care decisions. (Applause.) And when she comes out here and talks about that our children should be free to go to school without being shot dead in their classrooms. (Applause.) Look, we believe strongly in Minnesota in the Second Amendment, just like you do, but we also believe strongly in commonsense gun violence prevention law. (Applause.) Freedom to an education is a ticket to the middle class, not crushing student loan debt. (Applause.) And it's a place where we know freedom means we settle our political differences not through violence but with our votes. (Applause.) You get it. You -- you drove out here -- AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote! GOVERNOR WALZ: Yeah! (Claps.) AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote! GOVERNOR WALZ: Please. Look, and -- and let's all decide right now on this, or whatever. We know it's going to be hard race. We know it's going to be close, but let's don't be so close that these guys have anything to say. Let's don't be so close that they're going to come -- let's just win the damn thing by a broader margin. (Applause.) Simple proposition: This election is about which direction this country is going to go in. We know Donald Trump is taking us backwards. And don't believe the act -- he's playing dumb --he knows exactly what Project 2025 is going to do to our personal liberties. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: Destroy unions, rig the economy for the ultra-wealthy. We know that when he goes back, he's picking up and doing the same things he did when he was there the last time, except -- except -- you all know this -- it will be much, much worse when he comes back: raising costs for all of you, repealing the Affordable Care Act -- he doesn't care -- gutting Social Security. And be very clear: They can say whatever they want, they are banning abortion across this country. No questions asked. No questions asked. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: Yeah, you think this guy -- you think this guy cares about you or your family? AUDIENCE: No! GOVERNOR WALZ: His running mate has the same dangerous and backward agenda as Trump. Well, heck, you all know it. Every -- every regular person in the heartland went to Yale -- (laughter) -- had -- had Silicon Valley billionaires fund his career. And then he writes a book trashing the very community that raised him. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: That old thing is, ""I wasn't calling anybody names. I was just making an observation about them."" We can see it. And here's my thing, there's a lot of things going to happen, by the way. We've got about 91 days. And I keep telling people this: 91 days. My God, you can do anything for 91 days. AUDIENCE: Ninety! GOVERNOR WALZ: Ninety? Christ, I haven't slept in 24 hours. (Laughter.) You know -- you know why? We'll sleep when we're dead. We'll sleep when we're dead. (Applause.) Here's my -- here's my brass ring I'm looking for: I can't wait to debate this guy. I cannot wait to talk about what they think. (Applause.) I can't wait to ask him why he wants to take health care and take reproductive rights and why he wants to make sure that the wealthiest pay no taxes as we destroy unions and the middle class. So, here's the deal. You said it. These ideas that they're putting out there, they are weird as hell. No one is asking for it. No one is asking for it. (Applause.) We're asking a fair shot. We're asking for health care and childcare. We're asking for an education. We're asking for safety in our streets. That's what we're asking for. (Applause.) And we're going to get it, because that's what this campaign is about. It's about moving forward. (Applause.) Look, you know that Kamala Harris believes that you should be making the own choices in your life. She believes that every person should have an opportunity to enter the middle class. She believes in something so beautiful and simple with joy: She believes in the promise of this great nation. (Applause.) Look, she can take care of herself out front, and she said it. If they want to talk smack, she said it: ""Say it to my face, damn it. Say it to my face."" (Applause.) But what I got to say is, we got to have her back. We got to have her back. (Applause.) So, Madam Vice President, thank you for the trust you placed in me. Michigan, help me right now give a warm Midwest welcome to the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Detroit! (Applause.) Good evening. (Laughs.) (Applause.) We got this. We're going to do this. We are doing this. We are doing this. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you. AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay, come on. We've got thi- -- we've got business to handle. We've got business to handle. (Applause.) Good evening, everybody. (Applause.) Good evening, good evening, good evening. Can we hear it up for Tim Walz? (Applause.) Isn't he amazing? He's going to be the most incredible vice president. (Applause.) All right. So, it is good to be back and to be with so many incredible leaders. I love you. (Applause.) Governor Gretchen Whitmer, thank you for your -- (applause) -- thank you for your friendship, your sisterhood, and your leadership. And we are going to do this together. (Applause.) Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist, thank you so much. (Applause.) His parents are over there. And the members of Congress, including Senator Debbie Stabenow, my dear friend. (Applause.) And your next United States Senator, Representative Elissa Slotkin. (Applause.) We're going to get that done. Mayor Mike Duggan, thank you for the warm welcome always. And, of course, it is so good to be with the president of the United Auto Workers, my dear friend, Shawn Fain. (Applause.) And last year -- last week, it was my honor -- it feels like last year -- (laughter) -- last week, it was my great honor to accept the endorsement of the United Auto Workers. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: UAW! UAW! UAW! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And the UAW has always worked to lift up the working people of our nation. Do we need some help over there? I need -- we need a medic over there, please. There should be medics in each corner. We're good? Okay. All right. Look, let's all take care of each other and look f- -- look out for each other, all right? (Applause.) That's who we are. We look out for each other. Okay. So, as I said to Shawn -- (applause) -- as I talked to Shawn about this, this election is going to be a fight. We like a good fight. (Applause.) When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. We know what we stand for. (Applause.) So, I'm so proud to have UAW by my side, because you all know how to fight and you know how to win. (Applause.) Today, I also bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Joe! Joe! Joe! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. Joe. ADUIENCE: Joe! Joe! Joe! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. (Claps.) AUDIENCE: Joe! Joe! Joe! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I know we are all deeply, deeply grateful to Joe for his lifetime of service to our nation. And we thank you, Joe Biden, each and every day for all you are and all you still have yet to do. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Joe. AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. I'm going to tell him what you said. (Laughs.) So, Michigan, this has been a big week. (Applause.) On Monday, I officially became the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. (Applause.) And yesterday, I announced my running mate in this campaign, Governor Tim Walz. (Applause.) And as you just heard, he has an incredible record as governor of the great state of Minnesota. And to those who know him best -- some people are just getting to know him, but I'm going to tell you, you got to know him real quick, because he's incredible. He's a serious, serious man. He has been a serious leader, and he loves our country. And, you know, I've talked to some of the people who know him best, like his wife, Gwen. And to Gwen, Tim Walz is husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. (Applause.) To the people of southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was a congressman. (Applause.) To his former high school students, he is Mr. Walz. (Applause.) And to his former high school football players, he was Coach. (Applause.) And in 90 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by the title ""vice president of the United States."" (Applause.) That's right. So, it is so good to be back in Michigan. And listen, I am clear: The path to the White House runs right through this state. (Applause.) And with your help, we will win in November. We will win. (Applause.) And I know we are all clear about what we are up against. As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected as a United States senator, I was elected attorney general and, before that, elected district attorney -- and, before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.) In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain. So, hear me Detroit when I say: I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.) I've been dealing with them my whole career. For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of the country's largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. You remember that? AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: As attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud -- 34 counts, to be exact. AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hold on, hold on, hold on. You know what? Here -- hold on. Here's the thing. The courts are going to handle that. We're going to beat them in November. (Applause.) We're going to beat him in November, okay? We'll beat him in November. We'll handle that. But all that to say, in this campaign, I proudly put my record against his any day of the week -- (applause) -- any day of the week. But make no mistake, our campaign -- this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It's bigger than that. It is about two very different visions for the future of our nation -- one, ours, focused on the future and the other focused on the past. And, Michigan, we -- we here fight for the future. (Applause.) We fight for the future. We fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to join a union -- (applause); where every senior can retire with dignity -- (applause); a future with affordable housing, affordable childcare, affordable health care, and paid leave -- (applause); a future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth. (Applause.) And understand, in this fight, we are joyful warriors -- (applause) -- because while fighting for a brighter future may take hard work, we all here know hard work is good work. (Applause.) Hard work is good work. We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families so they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead. (Applause.) Because, look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it. When I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes. And when I am president, it will be my day one priority to fight to bring down prices -- (applause); to take on the big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging -- (applause); take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families -- (applause); to take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. (Applause.) That is the work we will do together. And all of this to say, unlike Donald Trump, I will always put the middle class and working families first -- (applause) -- because Coach Walz and I know the middle class built this great country of ours, and when the middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.) And, look, as we move our nation forward, Donald Trump intends to take our nation backward. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda -- Project 2025. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And please do check out Project 2025, because I'm telling you, it is a plan -- it is a plan to weaken America's middle class. Project 2025, if he is elected -- AUDIENCE: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's all good. It's all good. I'm here because we believe in democracy. Everyone's voice matters. But I am speaking now. (Applause.) I am speaking now. So, Project 2025 -- look, if he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis. And he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) We're not going back. We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we're not going back because we know what that would look like. And, again, understand: Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. We all remember what that looked like, and we're not going back. (Applause.) We're not going back. Our fight is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.) Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on attack on hard-fought, hard-won fundamental freedoms and rights, and we will not stand for it. (Applause.) Attacks on the freedom to vote, attacks on the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- (applause) -- and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.) Generations -- generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now the baton is in our hands, each and every one of us. (Applause.) So, we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and red flag laws. (Applause.) We who believe in the freedom to organize will pass the PRO Act and put an end to union-busting once and for all. (Applause.) And we who believe in reproductive freedom will fight for a woman's right to choose -- (applause) -- remembering what Donald Trump did to pick three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would take away this freedom, and they did as he intended. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: We who are paying attention to the fact that now over 20 states in our country have a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. And we all know, if he wins, he would sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every state, and that would include the great state of Michigan. (Applause.) But we're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And on that point, it is because there is a thing about who we are that is a bit different from the folks on the other side. We trust women to know what is in their best interests -- (applause) -- and not have their government telling them what to do. And when I am president of the United States and Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms, I will sign it into law. (Applause.) So, Michigan, here's the thing. So much -- so much -- so much is on the line in this election. (Applause.) And we got to remember, you know, we -- we knew -- we knew who he is and what he was about in '16 and in '20. But there's also something else that has happened recently that we really have to prioritize in our mind about the danger we're looking at. Last month, the United States Supreme Court basically just told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud, that going forward, he will be immune no matter what he does in the White House. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: But think about that. Think about that. Think about what that means. Think about what that means. The man has openly vowed, if reelected, that he will be a dictator on day one. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Think about what that means when he said that he will even, quote, ""terminate"" the Constitution of the United States. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because let us be very clear: Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Vote. Vote. AUDIENCE: Vote! Vote! Vote! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Vote. That's right. So, here's the thing. To your point, when it comes down to all of the things that are important about this, I think the most important thing -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you, Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you back. (Applause.) And -- listen, one of the things that I know brings us all out today and always is we love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That is how we preserve the promise of America. After all, the promise of America -- think about it -- is what makes it possible for Tim Walz and me to be together on this stage today. (Applause.) Think about it. Think about that. Two middle class kids. One a daughter of Oakland, California -- (applause) -- who was raised by a working mother -- I had a summer job at McDonald's. The other, a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm. Only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House. (Applause.) Only in America. Only in America. So, we are running this campaign on behalf of all Americans -- from red states to blue states, from the heartland to the coasts. And when elected, I promise you, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. (Applause.) I promise that. So, I'll close with this. Michigan, ultimately, in this election, we each face a question. We each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in? A country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law or a country of chaos, fear, and hate? AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And the beauty of our democracy -- the beauty of our democracy: We each have the power to answer that question. We each have the power to answer that question. (Applause.) The power is with the people. (Applause.) So, in the next 90 days, we need you to use your power. (Applause.) We need you to knock on some doors. (Applause.) We need you to register folks to vote. (Applause.) We need you to organize and energize and mobilize -- (applause) -- and make your voices heard. So, Michigan, I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.) And when we fight -- AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win. (Applause.) God bless you. And God bless the United States. (Applause.)","","",""

All the state and local officials are here, but I want to say -- a point of personal privilege on this -- I got a bunch of my family down here in the front, so -- (laughs). (Applause.) A coup- -- (applause) -- a couple of them -- a couple of them are Badgers too, by the way, so -- (applause). And a real special thank you to everybody here. Looking out across here, look, you're busy people. You got things to do. It's a summer day. You had to walk two miles. I had nothing to do with that, by the way -- (laughter) -- nothing, so -- But you came here for one beautiful, simple reason: You love this country and this democracy. (Applause.) I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket to help make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States. (Applause.) You know it: Vice President Harris is on the side of the American people. She took on predators, fraudsters, transnational gang members. She stood up against powerful corporate interests. And she never hesitated, not once, to reach across the aisle if it improved people's lives. (Applause.) Being a Midwesterner too, I know a little something about commitment to people. I was born in a small town in Nebraska, where community meant everything. My mom and dad taught me to show generosity to my neighbors and work for a common good. At 17, I joined the Army National Guard. (Applause.) For 24 years, I proudly wore the uniform of this nation. (Applause.) And -- and that service, just as it did for my dad, a Korean War-era veteran, and millions of others, I got the G.I. Bill, and it gave me a shot at a college education. (Applause.) My dad was a teacher. My siblings were all teachers. (Applause.) And three of them married teachers. (Applause.) It's noble work. I had the privilege of teaching public school social studies and coaching football for 20 years. (Applause.) And for all you Packer and Badgers fan, yeah, we did win a state championship, so -- (laughter and applause). It's what we do. But it was my students who encouraged me to run for office. I never thought that much about it, but they saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them: this idea of a commitment to a better world, a common good, a belief that one single person can actually make a difference. (Applause.) I lived in a red district, but my neighbors were kind enough and graced me with the opportunity to go to the United States House of Representatives for 12 years to represent them. (Applause.) I learned how to compromise without compromising my values. (Applause.) And as governor of the great state of Minnesota, I brought all that experience -- (applause) -- Okay, okay. Are there Minnesotans in the house today? (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Tim! Tim! Tim! GOVERNOR WALZ: -- bringing that experience to tackling the challenges that were facing our state. We don't shy away from challenges. But I'll tell you what, Donald Trump -- he sees the world differently than we see it. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: He has no understanding of service because he's too busy servicing himself -- (laughter) -- again and again and again. Again and again and again, this guy weakens our country to strengthen his own hand. He mocks our laws, he sows chaos and division amongst the people, and that's to say nothing of the job he did as president. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: He froze in the face of COVID, and it cost people's lives. AUDIENCE: Yes! GOVERNOR WALZ: He drove the economy into the ground. AUDIENCE: Yes! GOVERNOR WALZ: And make no mistake about it, violent crime was up when Donald Trump was president. (Applause.) Those of you who are a little older know this. Older Republicans used to talk about freedom. These guys today, it turns out that freedom to them means government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: Now, look, we're pretty neighborly with Wisconsin. We get our friendly battles. But in Minnesota, just like in Wisconsin, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make -- (applause) -- even if -- even if we wouldn't make the same choices for ourselves, because we know there's a golden rule: Mind your own damn business. Mind your own damn business. (Applause.) I don't need you telling me about our health care, I don't need you telling us who we love, and I sure the hell don't need you telling us what books we're going to read. (Applause.) And there's a very personal one for me, and that includes IVF. Some of you might have heard this. This is very personal for my wife and I. When Gwen and I decided to have children, we went through years of fertility treatments. And I remember each night praying that the call was going to come, and it was going to be good news. The phone would ring, tenseness in my stomach, and then the agony when you heard the treatments hadn't worked. So, it wasn't by chance that when we welcomed our first child, our beautiful daughter, we named her Hope. (Applause.) When Vice President Harris and I and everyone here talks about freedom, we mean the freedom to make your own health care decisions -- (applause) -- and for all of our little ones to be free to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in their classroom. (Applause.) And just like Wisconsin, over in Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in commonsense gun violence laws. (Applause.) And just so you know, when I was in Congress, I was the top gun at the trap shoot three years in a ray [row]. I can outshoot them too. (Applause.) I can outshoot these guys. Look, freedom is when -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: Help! GOVERNOR WALZ: Freedom is -- oh. Can we -- can we get somebody to help? Somebody's hot. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Somebody help her! GOVERNOR WALZ: Somebody's hot. Can we get somebody to help? You okay? Drink some water, folks. It is hot out. Get somebody o- -- GOVERNOR WALZ: Thank you. (Applause.) Can we get water? AUDIENCE: They're so weird! They're so weird! They're so weird! GOVERNOR WALZ: (Laughs.) She's okay? AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you for helping! GOVERNOR WALZ: Yeah. Thank you all for helping. I'm grateful. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you all. Take care of one another on this. This is -- this is why we gather. Look, it's hot. It is hot. I'll come again. They've got folks here. We'll -- we'll make sure it -- we're okay. But I -- I have to tell you all again, I -- in all seriousness, to come and gather like this to talk about our freedoms, the ability to talk about what could be good -- and I have to say, this idea of caring for our neighbor in kindness and a hand up when somebody needs it or just the sense of that people go through things and to be able to be there when they need it, that's who we are. It's not about mocking. It's not name-callings and -- you see it amongst them. (Applause.) (Claps.) Yay! Thank you all. (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible) more water down there? GOVERNOR WALZ: They do. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Someone up here needs one. GOVERNOR WALZ: Thank you all. We're e- -- we're okay. He's going to -- we have someone down. They're treating him, they're getting him some water, and it's good. He's going to get up. You guys need some water too? We'll ask them. Teddy, can you see if they have some more water? That'd be great. Take care of your neighbors. There we go. (Applause.) There we go. There we go. All right. All right, folks. Hey, they're getting him taken care of. I -- we'll stay -- I don't want to be too lighthearted. I thought about doing the Minnesota Rouser, but I thought that might be too much over here on you. (Applause.) Look, we'll get -- we'll get him taken care of. You know what this is about. This is about when they talk about the freedoms that we heard, and freedom in education means that our teachers aren't saddled with crippling debt when they go into this -- the student loan debt. (Applause.) And I'll tell you what a big part of this is: We settle our political differences not through violence but through our votes. (Applause.) The question is pretty simple. This election is all about asking that question. Which direction will this country go in? Donald Trump knows the direction he wants to take us. He wants to take it back. He wants to do the things that you saw. But be very clear. Don't believe him when he plays dumb. He knows exactly what he's talking about. He knows exactly what Project 2025 will do in restricting and taking our freedoms. He knows that it rigs the economy for the super rich. If he gets a chance to go back to the White House, it will be far worse than it was four years ago -- (applause) -- raising costs for the middle class; refeating -- repealing the Affordable Care Act; gutting Social Security and Medicare, the very safety nets that protect people when they're down; and, of course, banning abortions across this country with or without Congress. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: This is where we talk to our neighbors. Donald Trump is not for you or your family. And Trump's running mate shares those same dangerous and backward beliefs. You know, just like all of us in regular America, we -- we go to Yale and then we have our careers funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then you write a book about the place you grew up and you trash that place. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: Come on. That's not who Wisconsin is. That's not who Minnesota is. We're better than that. We're better than that. (Applause.) One of the best parts of this job is going to be -- I can't wait until the debate, so -- (laughs). (Applause.) Look, I -- I've done this enough and I know bullies. And I'm not a name-caller, but what I am is a teacher; I observe things. So, I want to tell you: What I observed and you've deserved about -- observed about these guys when you see them, that it's a very clear thing. Yes, they are creepy and -- and weird as hell. (Applause.) You see it. You see it. This is not normal. This is not normal behavior. Nobody is asking for this crazy stuff. So, I'll tell you what. You heard it from the vice president; you've heard her talk about this. We're sure the hell not going back. We're not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! GOVERNOR WALZ: We are not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! GOVERNOR WALZ: We damn sure aren't, but it's even more than that. This is a campaign about where we're going, and that's a future where everyone matters and everyone is included. (Applause.) Kamala Harris, she believes in the freedom to make your own choices. She believes in opportunity for every single person to join the middle class. And she believes in the promise of America. (Applause.) Thank you, Madam Vice President, for the trust that you've placed in me. Wisconsin, please help me in giving a warm Midwest welcome to the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, Wisconsin! (Laughs.) (Applause.) Good afternoon. Oh, it's good to be back. Good afternoon, everybody. Can we hear it for Tim Walz? (Laughs.) (Applause.) Oh, I'm so happy to be running with him, let me tell you. So, let me start by thanking Les. Your words, your leadership, your voice, it's so important, Les. Thank you for everything you are and everything you do for our country. (Applause.) And it is good to be with so many incredible leaders, including the most magnificent, wonderful governor, Tony Evers. Every time I come to Wisconsin, Tony meets me on the tarmac. He's such an incredible human being. (Applause.) I want to thank Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski -- (applause); chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Ben Wikler -- (applause); and my dear, dear friend, Senator Tammy Baldwin. (Applause.) I served with Tammy when I was in the United States Senate, and I'm going to tell you, she was always, always, always fighting for the people of this state. And in November, we are going to re-elect her to the United States Senate. (Applause.) And please give it up one more time for Wisconsin's own Bon Iver. (Applause.) It's a good afternoon. It's a good afternoon. And let me say, I also want to just -- I want to bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. (Applause.) He loves Wisconsin. He loves Wisconsin. And I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation -- (applause) -- and for all he continues to do. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you, Joe! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's great. AUDIENCE: Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! THE VICE PRESIDENT: There we go. That's right. I'm going to tell him what you said. (Laughter.) So, Wisconsin, this has been a big week. (Applause.) On Monday, I officially became the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. (Applause.) And yesterday, I announced my running mate in this campaign, Governor Tim Walz. (Applause.) And as you just heard -- and the Minnesotans here know -- Tim has an incredible record as governor of the great state of Minnesota. (Applause.) And to those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is Dad. To his fedel- -- fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. (Applause.) To the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was a congressman. (Applause.) To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. (Applause.) And to his former high school football players, he was Coach. (Applause.) Coach. AUDIENCE: Coach! Coach! Coach! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. And in 90 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by a new title: vice president of the United States of America. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: VP Walz! VP Walz! VP Walz! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. Oh, it really is good to be back in Wisconsin. (Laughter and applause.) So, listen, let me tell you. I am clear: The path to the White House runs right through this state. (Applause.) And with your help, we will win in November. We are going to win. (Applause.) We are going to win. And I've been here many times, as you all know, recently and even before. And many of you know, then, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, an elected district attorney. (Applause.) And before that -- and before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.) So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.) (Laughs.) I know his type. In fact, I've been dealing with people like him my whole career. (Applause.) For example, as attorney general of California -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, hold on. The cou- -- you know what, the courts are going to handle that part of it. (Laughter.) What we're going to do is beat him in November. (Applause.) (Laughs.) So, I'll tell you, as attorney general, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: As attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. (Applause.) Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud -- 34 counts. (Applause.) So, in this campaign, I'll tell you: I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week -- (applause) -- any day of the week. But let's make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It's about two very different visions for our nation -- two very different visions: one, for us, focused on the future; the other focused on the past. And, Wisconsin, we -- we here -- we fight for the future. (Applause.) We fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to join a union -- (applause); where -- AUDIENCE: Union strong! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Union strong. AUDIENCE: Union strong! Union strong! Union strong! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity -- (applause); a future where we build a broad-based economy and one where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build wealth. (Applause.) And understand, in this fight, as Tim Walz likes to point out, we are joyful warriors -- (applause) -- joyful warriors. Because we know that while fighting for a brighter future may be hard work, hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.) And so, we will continue to fight for affordable housing, for affordable health care, affordable childcare, and paid leave. (Applause.) We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families so that they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead -- (applause) -- because while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it. You know, when I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes. And when I am president, it will be a day-one priority to fight to bring down prices. (Applause.) I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging. I will take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families. I will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans -- (applause) -- and continue to bring manufacturing jobs back to America -- (applause) -- and back to communities like Eau Claire. (Applause.) So, all this is to say: Strengthening our economy and building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. (Applause.) Because, you see, Coach Walz and I know when America's middle class is strong, America is strong. And as we work to move our nation forward, Donald Trump intends to take our nation backward. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: There is so much evidence of that point. There really is. But look at, most recently, Project 2025 and that agenda. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Project 2025 -- you know, if you have some time to take a look at it, I'm telling you, it -- it is a plan to weaken the middle class. It is a plan to weaken the middle class. If he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis, and he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. AUDIENCE: Noo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And because we all remember what it was like before the Affordable Care Act, we understand what that means. That's about taking us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember that -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- what that was like when -- we're not going back. We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back. But in order to know where we need to go, let's remember the past and what that was like, because we cannot forget. On that point about the ACA, remember people with pre-existing conditions being denied -- children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes? That was no joke. And we cannot go back. Ours has to be a fight for the future and a fight for freedom -- (applause) -- a fight for freedom. Across our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water -- (applause); the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- (applause); and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. (Applause.) And let's remember -- let's remember the traditions of our great country. Generations of Americans before us led in the fight for freedom. And now, then, as they would expect, the baton is in our hands. The baton is in our hands, each and every one of us. So, we, then, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban. (Applause.) We who believe in reproductive freedom will fight for a woman's right to choose. (Applause.) And we remember that when he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court -- the court of Thurgood and RBG -- because he intended for them to overturn Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And now more than 20 states in our country have a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And if he wins, we all know he will sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every state, even in Wisconsin. AUDIENCE: Noo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: But we are not going to let that happen. AUDIENCE: No! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Because we trust women. (Applause.) And when I am president of the United States and when Congress passes a bill to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade, I will sign it into law. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you all. So, listen, everyone took time out of your busy lives and days and all your obligations to come out here and to be together as one community. (Applause.) And I know you did it also because we all know, listen, so much is on the line in this election. It can't be said seriously enough. So much is on the line. And compounded with everything else that we knew was on the line, think about the fact that last month, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud, that, going forward, he will be immune no matter what he does in the White House. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Think about what that means and the changed circumstances since 16-6-20 when you think about what that court decision means. Donald Trump has openly vowed, if re-elected, he will be a dictator on day one -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- that he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- that he would round up peaceful protesters and throw them out of our country -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and even, quote, terminate the United States Constitution. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, let us be clear. Let us be clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have a chance to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) So, basically, I think it all comes down to this. We're all here because we love our country. We love our country. (Applause.) We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. And that's how we preserve the promise of America, because, after all, the promise of America is what makes it possible, by the way, for Governor Walz and me to stand on this stage today. Just think about it: two middle-class kids, one a daughter of Oakland, California, who was raised by a working mother -- (applause) -- and had a summer job at McDonald's -- (applause); the other, a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm. (Applause.) Think about that. Only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way, together, to the White House. (Applause.) Only in America. Only in America. (Applause.) So, this is a fight to make real the promise of America for every person in our nation. And, also, I'll tell you -- and I promise you, our campaign is going to reach out to everyone -- from red states, from blue states, from the heartland to the coast. We are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans. (Applause.) And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. (Applause.) Because Coach Walz and I know -- and we're clear about this, unlike the other side -- we work for you. (Applause.) We work for you, the American people, and we will always fight for you -- for your family, for your freedoms, and for your future. So, Wisconsin, ultimately, this election is about a question that we each face. We each face a question in this election, and that is: What kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom, of compassion, of rule of law -- AUDIENCE: Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- or a country of chaos, fear, and hate? AUDIENCE: Noo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And the beauty of our democracy is we each have the power -- individually and collectively, we each have the power in a democracy to answer that question. The power is with the people. The power is with the people. (Applause.) So, in the next 90 days, we need you to use your power. (Applause.) We need you to knock on doors. We need you to register folks to vote. We need you to energize and organize and mobilize and make your voices heard. (Applause.) And I'll tell you, about an hour ago, after I landed on Air Force Two, I -- I met a collection of young leaders from Girl Scout Troop 3307. Oh, they were spectacular. Oh, they were spectacular. None of them high- -- taller than three feet. They -- (laughter) -- I mean, just they were spectacular. And one of those young leaders had a shirt on that said, ""You are powerful, and your voice matters."" (Applause.) Right? From the mouths of babes, they're telling us. They're telling us. And so, let's remember that. Let's remember our power. Let's remember our voice matters. And with that, then, I ask: Are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.) And when we fight -- AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win! God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)","","",""

We're doing this. (Applause.) Good evening, Philadelphia! (Applause.) Good evening. (Applause.) Good evening, good evening. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening. Oh, it is good to be back in Pennsylvania. (Applause.) So, let me say, on behalf of myself and the first second gentleman of the United States, my husband, Doug Emhoff -- (applause) -- thank you for the warm welcome. (Applause.) And let me just say, it's good to be here with all of the friends, all of the leaders who are here. I want to thank former Governor Ed Rendell -- (applause); Senator Bob Casey, who we will reelect this November -- (applause); Senator John Fetterman -- (applause); Mayor Cherelle Parker -- (applause); and Chairman Jaime Harrison. (Applause.) And it is so good to be here with your incredible governor, Josh Shapiro. (Applause.) And I will say Josh is a dear, dear friend and an extraordinary leader. He and I have been spending a lot of time together over the years. And I told Josh, ""Look, I am so, so invested in our friendship, in doing this together."" Because together, with Josh Shapiro, we will win Pennsylvania. (Applause.) We will win Pennsylvania. And I thank you, Josh. I thank you. (Applause.) So -- so, Philadelphia, I launched my campaign for the president of the United States a mere two weeks ago. (Applause.) And it's -- it's been a bit of a whirlwind. (Laughter.) And just last night, the delegates to the Democratic National Convention finished voting, and so -- (applause) -- I stand -- I stand before you today to proudly announce I am now officially the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. (Applause.) And so, now we got some work to do. We need to move to the general election and win that. (Applause.) And to all the friends, listen, we also need to level set. We are the underdogs in this race, but we have the momentum, and I know exactly what we are up against. (Applause.) Now, many of you know, before I was elected vice president or elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, elected district attorney. (Applause.) And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.) So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds -- (applause): predators who abused women -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- fraudsters who scammed consumers -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, hear me when I say -- (applause) -- I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! THE VICE PRESIDENT: So -- but let -- AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let me -- let me just say. AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let me say. Hold on. AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hold on, hold on. This campaign, our campaign is not just a fight against Donald Trump. (Applause.) Our campaign, this campaign is a fight for the future. (Applause.) It's a fight for the future. And, Pennsylvania, we fight for a future with affordable housing, affordable health care, affordable childcare, paid leave. (Applause.) We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth. (Applause.) We fight for a future where we bring down prices that are still too high and lower the cost of living for American families -- (applause) -- so that they have the chance not just to get by but to get ahead. (Applause.) We fight for a future where we defend our most fundamental freedoms: the freedom to vote -- (applause); the freedom to be safe from gun violence -- (applause); the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- (applause); and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body not having her government tell her what to do. (Applause.) So -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: I love you too. So, here's the thing. Here's the thing. Since the day that I announced my candidacy, I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future -- (applause) -- a leader who will help unite our nation and move us forward; a fighter for the middle class; a patriot who believes, as I do, in the extraordinary promise of America -- (applause) -- a promise -- a promise of freedom, opportunity, and justice not just for some but for all. (Applause.) So, Pennsylvania, I'm here today because I found such a leader: Governor Tim Walz of the great state of Minnesota. (Applause.) So, to those who know him best -- to those who know him best, Tim is -- is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is a dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. (Applause.) To the people -- to the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was Congressman. (Applause.) To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. (Applause.) And to his former high school football players, he was Coach -- (applause) -- Coach -- Coach. And in 91 days -- (applause) -- the nation will know Coach Walz by another name: vice president of the United States. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Tim! Tim! Tim! THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, America, for some folks, they're just getting to know Coach Walz's story. And I'll tell you, he is the proud product of a middle-class family in rural Nebraska. (Applause.) He is a veteran who served our nation in uniform for more than two decades -- (applause) -- as a member of the Army National Guard, and he went to college on the G.I. Bill. (Applause.) He is someone who, long before he entered politics, worked as a teacher. (Applause.) When Coach Walz and his wife, Gwen, moved from his native Nebraska to Minnesota nearly 30 years ago, they both took jobs at the local high school. (Applause.) Coach Walz taught social studies; Gwen taught English. (Applause.) After school, Tim was the linebackers coach for the football team -- (applause) -- where I've heard the stories about he had a knack for using the game of football to teach life lessons. He saw the potential in kids who sometimes didn't even see it in themselves. (Applause.) Under those Friday night lights, Coach Walz motivated his players to believe they could achieve anything. And, together, they defied the odds -- hear this out -- going from a winless record to the school's first-ever state championship. (Applause.) (Laughs.) Coach. Coach. A- -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) (Laughter.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: And I'll say and I'll add, Tim wasn't only a role model on the football field. Around that same time, Coach Walz was approached by a student in his social studies class. The young man was one of the first openly gay students at the school and was hoping to start a gay-straight alliance. At a time -- (applause) -- at a time when acceptance was difficult to find for LGBTQ students, Tim knew the signal that it would send to have a football coach get involved. (Applause.) Right? So, he signed up to be the group's faculty advisor. (Applause.) And as students have said, he made the school a safe place for everybody. (Applause.) In the high school yearbook, the students voted Coach Walz the, quote, ""most inspiring faculty member."" (Applause.) And as I think everyone here can see, Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having -- (applause) -- and that every kid deserves; the kind of coach, because he's the kind of person who makes people feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big. And that's the kind of vice president he will be. (Applause.) And that's the kind of vice president America deserves. (Applause.) So, it was Coach Walz's students who actually helped him decide to run for office, and he served 12 years in Congress, representing a purple district, as he reached across the aisle to get things done. He was the highest-ranking -- (applause) -- he was the highest-ranking enlisted man to ever serve in the United States Congress -- (applause) -- and the top Democrat on the Veterans Committee. (Applause.) And he was known as one of Capitol Hill's best marksmen -- (laughter) -- winning a bipartisan sharpshooting contest year after year. (Applause.) In Washington, Tim worked to raise the minimum wage -- (applause); to protect the freedom of workers to join a union -- (applause); and he cast one of the critical votes to pass the Affordable Care Act -- (applause) -- which, of course, gave health insurance to tens of millions of Americans. And I'm going to tell you, when we win, Tim and I will continue to make the Affordable Care Act even stronger. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: When we win! When we win! When we win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win. That's right. Now let's talk about what we're dealing with on the other side. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, on that last topic, if Donald Trump gets the chance, he will end the Affordable Care Act -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- and take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was like? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes. Well, Governor Walz and I will not let that happen -- (applause) -- because we believe health care should be a right and not just a privilege for those who can afford it. (Applause.) As governor, Tim has continued to fight for working families. He secured paid leave for workers in Minnesota. (Applause.) And he refused -- he refused, as governor, to allow any student in their public schools to go hungry -- (applause) -- so he made school breakfast and lunch free for every child. (Applause.) And Tim Walz and I, we agree about many things, including when our middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.) And strengthening the middle class will be my defining goal as I am president of the United States. (Applause.) So, Pennsylvania, ours is a fight for the future of the middle class and it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.) In this moment, we are witnessing a full-on attack against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights. (Applause.) Take reproductive freedom. Now think about this: Donald Trump said he wants to punish women. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And as a result of his actions, today in America one out of three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban -- one out of three. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Some of these bans go back to the 1800s, even before women had a right to vote. Think about that. Well, Tim and I have a message for Trump and others who want to turn back the clock on our fundamental freedoms: We're not going back. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And so, let me say about Tim Walz, he has shown up to stand against these attacks long before he stood on the stage with me. After Roe was overturned, he was the first governor in the country to sign a new law that enshrined reproductive freedom as a fundamental right. (Applause.) And with Tim Walz by my side, when I am president of the United States and we win majorities in the United States Congress, we will pass a bill to restore reproductive freedom, and I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Tim Walz has also defended the sacred freedom to vote. As governor -- (applause) -- as governor, he signed the most significant expansion of voting rights in Minnesota in over 50 years. (Applause.) And with Governor Walz's help, when I am president, we are going to finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) We're going to get it done. So, Tim is a hunter and a gun owner who believes, as the majority of gun owners do, that we need reasonable gun safety laws in America. (Applause.) So, as governor, he expanded background checks and increased penalties for illegal firearm sales. (Applause.) And together, when we win in November, we are finally going to pass universal background checks -- (applause) -- red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban. (Applause.) Through his work, Tim, he -- you know, the way I think about it, he really does shine a light on a brighter future that we can build together. In his state, he has been a model chief executive. And with his experience, I'm telling you, Tim Walz will be ready on day one. (Applause.) In fact -- in fact, when you compare his resume -- (laughter) -- shall we? -- to Trump's running mate, well -- well -- well, some might say it's like -- it's like a matchup between the varsity team and the JV squad. (Applause.) (Laughs.) So, Pennsylvania, ultimately, in this election, we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in? A country -- a country of freedom -- (applause) -- compassion, and rule of law or a country of chaos, fear, and hate? AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: And here's the beauty of our democracy: We each have the power to answer that question. We each have the power to answer that question. (Applause.) The power is with the people. (Applause.) We love our country, and I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. (Applause.) That -- that is how we preserve the promise of America. And after all, you know, the promise of America is what makes it possible for two middle-class kids -- one a daughter of Oakland, California -- (applause) -- who was raised by a working mother; the other a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm -- (applause) -- it's the promise of America, because only in America -- only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House. (Applause.) Only in America. Only in America. Only in America. AUDIENCE: U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. AUDIENCE: U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right. And so, Coach Walz and I may hail from different corners of our great country, but our values are the same. And we both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them down. (Applause.) He and I, we both know the vast majority of people in our country have so much more in common than what separates them. (Applause.) When we look at folks, we see, in our fellow Americans, neighbors, not enemies -- (applause) -- not enemies. And so, my promise to you is this. Our campaign will reach out to everyone, from red states to blue states -- (applause) -- from the heartland to the coasts; in rural, urban, suburban, and Tribal communities. (Applause.) We are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans. (Applause.) And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. (Applause.) And so, with Tim Walz by my side and with all of you at our side -- (applause) -- let us fight for the promise of our future. (Applause.) And with that, I ask: Pennsylvania, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.) And when we fight -- AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win. (Applause.) And now welcome the next vice president of the United States, Tim Walz. (Applause.) GOVERNOR WALZ: Wow. (Applause.) Thank you. Wow. Thank you, Philadelphia. (Applause.) Thank you, Madam Vice President, for the trust you put in me but, maybe more so, thank you for bringing back the joy. (Applause.) I'm thrilled to be on this journey with you and Doug -- this incredible journey. And, Pennsylvania, I know you know this, but, my God, what a treasure you have in Josh Shapiro. (Applause.) Holy hell, can this guy bring the fire. He can bring the fire. This is a visionary leader. Also, I have to tell you, everybody in America knows, when you need a bridge fixed, call that guy. (Applause.) And I think sometimes we forget and you see people a little one-dimensional, but seeing a guy who cares so deeply about his family, a man with compassion, vision -- and I'll have to tell you this; I know this from experience -- there is no one you would rather go to a Springsteen concert in Jersey with than him -- (laughter) -- than that guy. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Bruce! GOVERNOR WALZ: Bruce! And I can't wait for all of you and America to get to know my incredible wife, Gwen, a 29-year public school educator --(applause) -- don't ever underestimate teachers -- (applause) -- and our two beautiful kids, Hope and Gus. I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket and to help Vice President Harris become what we all know is very, very good for us to think about: next president of the United States of America. (Applause.) From her first day as a prosecutor, as a district attorney, attorney general of the great state of California -- (applause) -- a United States senator, and vice president of the United States -- (applause) -- Vice President Harris has fought on the side of the American people. (Applause.) She took on the predators, she took on the fraudsters, she took down the transnational gangs, she stood up against powerful corporate interests, and she never hesitated to reach across the aisle if it meant improving people's lives. (Applause.) And I want all of you to hold this and don't ever underestimate the power of this: She does it all with a sense of joy. (Applause.) I know a little something about that commitment to people. I was born in West Point, Nebraska. I lived in Butte, a small town of 400, where community was a way of life. Growing up, I spent the summers working on the family farm. My mom and dad taught us: Show generosity towards your neighbors and work for a common good. (Applause.) My dad served in the Army during the Korean War, and with his encouragement, at 17, I joined the Army National Guard. (Applause.) For 24 years, I proudly wore the uniform of this nation. (Applause.) The National Guard gave me purpose, it gave me the strength of a shared commitment to something greater than ourselves, and just as it did for my dad and millions of others, the G.I. Bill gave me a shot at a college education. (Applause.) My dad was a teacher; my brothers and sisters and I followed in their footsteps. (Applause.) Three out of four of us married teachers -- (applause) -- what we do. For nearly 20 years, I had the privilege of teaching high school social studies and coaching football -- (applause) -- including winning that state championship. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Don't ever close the yearbook. Don't ever. But it was my students -- they encouraged me to run for office. They saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them: a commitment of common good, a belief that one person can make a difference. So, in 2006 -- (applause) -- in 2006, I took a leap, and I ran for Congress. (Applause.) And because high school teachers are super optimistic, I was running in a district that had one Democrat since 1892. (Laughter.) Well, my neighbors graced me with an opportunity to represent them in the United States House of Representatives. (Applause.) I'm proud of the work we did there together. I worked across the aisle on veterans issues, on agriculture, and on ways to grow rural economies. I learned the art of compromise without compromising my values. (Applause.) And now as governor the great state of Minnesota, I bring those experiences to bear in tackling the challenges that are facing our great state. Minnesota's strengths comes from our values, our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to always being willing to lend a helping hand. Those are the same values I learned on the family farm and tried to instill in my students. I took it to Congress and to the state capitol, and now Vice President Harris and I are running to take those very values to the White House. (Applause.) Now, Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than us. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: First of all, he doesn't know the first thing about service. (Applause.) He doesn't have time for it because he's too busy serving himself. (Applause.) Again and again and again, Trump weakens our economy to strengthen his own hand. (Applause.) He mocks our laws, he sows chaos and division, and that's to say nothing of his record as president. (Applause.) He froze in the face of the COVID crisis, he drove our economy into the ground, and make no mistake, violent crime was up under Donald Trump. (Applause.) That's not even counting the crimes he committed. (Applause.) You know -- AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! GOVERNOR WALZ: -- some of us -- AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! GOVERNOR WALZ: -- some of us are -- AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! GOVERNOR WALZ: Some of us -- some of us in here are old enough to remember. I see you down there. (Laughter.) I see those old white guys. (Laughter.) Some of us are old enough to remember when it was Republicans who were talking about freedom. It turns out now what they meant was the government should be free to invade your doctor's office. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and their personal choices that they make. Even if we wouldn't make the same choice for ourselves, there's a golden rule: Mind your own damn business. (Applause.) These guys are after my heart, chanting ""Mind your own damn business."" That feels good, so thank you. Look, that includes IVF, and this gets personal for me and my family. (Applause.) When my wife and I decided to have children, we spent years going through infertility treatments, and I remember praying every night for a call for good news, the pit in my stomach when the phone rang, and the agony when we heard that the treatments hadn't worked. So, it wasn't by chance that when we welcomed our daughter into the world, we named her Hope. (Applause.) When the vice president and I talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make your own health care decisions -- (applause) -- and for our children to be free to go to school without worrying they'll be shot dead in their classrooms. (Applause.) By the way, as you heard, I was one of the best shots in Congress. But in Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in commonsense gun violence laws. (Applause.) Vice President Harris's idea of freedom is a ticket for education to be that ticket to the middle class, not crippling debt -- (applause); air that's clean, water that's pure, communities that are safe -- (applause); a place where we settle our political differences not through violence but with our votes. (Applause.) And that's what this election is about: What direction will this country go in? AUDIENCE MEMBER: Freedom! (Applause.) GOVERNOR WALZ: We're not going back. Well, Donald Trump would damn sure take us backwards, let's be clear about that. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: And don't believe him when he plays dumb. He knows exactly what Project 2025 will do to restrict our freedoms -- (applause) -- to rig the economy to help the super-rich. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: If Trump gets a chance to return, he's going to pick up exactly where he left off four years ago -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: -- only this time it will be much, much worse: raising costs on middle-class family. He will repea- -- repeal the Affordable Care Act, no doubt about it. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: He'll gut Social Security and Medicare. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: And when somebody tells who they are, they -- believe them. He said he would ban abortion across this country, and he'll do it whether or not Congress is there or not. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: Donald Trump is not fighting for you or your family. AUDIENCE MEMBER: You are! GOVERNOR WALZ: He never s- -- he never sat at that kitchen table, like the one I grew up at, wondering how we were going to pay the bills. He sat at his country club up in Mar-a-Lago, wondering how he can cut taxes for his rich friends. (Applause.) And I got to tell you, his running mate shares his dangerous and backward agenda for this country. (Applause.) J.D. Vance literally -- literally wrote the foreword for the architect of the Project 2025 agenda. AUDIENCE: Booo -- GOVERNOR WALZ: Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, J.D. studied at Yale -- (laughter) -- had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community. Come on. That's not what Middle America is. And I got to tell you, I can't wait to debate the guy. (Applause.) That is if -- if he's willing to get off the couch and show up, so -- (laughter). You see what I did there? Look -- (laughs) -- I got to tell you -- pointing out just an observation of mine that I -- that I made. I just have to say it. You know it, you feel it: These guys are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell. That's what you see. (Laughs.) (Applause.) That's what you see. So, you know what's out there, so say it with me: We aren't going back. AUDIENCE: We aren't going back! GOVERNOR WALZ: We aren't going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! GOVERNOR WALZ: We are not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! GOVERNOR WALZ: So, we got 91 days. My God, that's easy. (Laughter.) We'll sleep when we're dead. (Applause.) Over those next 91 days and every day in the White House, I'll have Vice President Harris's back -- every single day. (Applause.) And we'll have yours. (Applause.) You know how this works. We can't do it alone. We need you, each and every one of you. (Applause.) Go over to KamalaHarris.com, get on board, because we need you. Freedom to make our own choices -- this leader -- this compassionate, careful, joyous leader -- believes in each and every one of you. (Applause.) My God, you came here tonight to sit at the very top because you love this country and you're not going back. (Applause.) She believes in the opportunity for every single person to join the middle class. She believes in the promise of America. We just got to fight. We just got to fight, because as soon-to-be-President Harris says, when we fight -- AUDIENCE: We win! GOVERNOR WALZ: -- we win. (Applause.) Thank you, Philadelphia. Thank you, Vice President. God bless America. (Applause.)","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374962",73229,"[music: Lee Greenwood, ""God Bless the USA""] CROWD: We love Trump! TRUMP: They saw some pretty bad things. CROWD: We love Trump! TRUMP: Thank you. CROWD: We love Trump! TRUMP: Thank you very much. No, they—they did an amazing job. And we have—by the way, we have the doctor—one of the great doctors was there. He worked on Corey, actually. He—was Corey, he had a hard time. Corey—Corey is special. Thank you, Doctor. Appreciate it very much. Great—great doctors, great doctors. The job they did on David Dutch and James Copenhaver was just incredible. And as you know, they brought them back from very, very seriously wounded. They were going to be maybe not with us. There was a group of us, but they are doing really well now. They're making it. They're going to be fine. Not going to be perfect maybe, but who is—who is? As we get older, who is perfect? But the doctors were so great. They had two great doctors also. And most of all, we lift the memory—our memory to the brave firefighter who was so cruelly taken from us, Corey Comperatore. Corey Comperatore, a very brave guy, loved by his family and his friends. He was really loved. In his last act on this earth, Corey threw himself over his wife and daughters and died shielding them from the bullets—the bullets of a very disturbed guy. Corey is a hero to all of us—to all of us. CROWD: Corey! Corey! Corey! TRUMP: I want to thank a friend of mine, too. I'm not going to mention his name because he's pretty well-known, and he came up to me, he said, ""Would it be okay if I presented Corey's wife and family with a check?"" And I said, ""Yeah, it would be okay with me. It's certainly okay."" And he handed me a check for $1 million, $1 million. Think of that. Thank you, Dan. So, he was very generous. In addition, we have a GoFundMe that's—it's really been great. I think we're at $6 million mark for the—the three of them, plus some other people. So—but you know what, Corey's wife said, ""I'd rather have my husband."" Isn't that good? I know a lot of wives that would not say that. I'm sorry. [laughs] They would not say that. But no, it's a great family. He was a great man. He was a brave man. He saw what was happening and he jumped on top and he got hit. But we will carry Corey's spirit of love and devotion and patriotism with us for all time, and we will never forget Corey or his beautiful family. And maybe let's have a brief moment of silence in memory of Corey, great Pennsylvanian. [Trump bows head] Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Beautiful. Beautiful. [applause] That is the most quiet I have ever heard an arena. I have never heard—you could hear a pin drop. No, it's amazing. It's a beautiful thing. In the wake of this heinous attack, we gather tonight more determined than ever. Our resolve is unbroken, and our will is undeterred. Nothing will stop us on our mission to make America great again. Nothing's going to stop us. Our country is doing badly. Front-row joes over here, front-row joes. Look at them. They've been to 212 events. You know, I'm pretty sure we have their vote. I'm not sure. You can never be sure of anything. You're voting for Trump? OK. Front-row joes, they love us and we love them. Thank you very much. Thanks, everybody. But as we're fighting to bring back the American dream for you and your family, the radical left Democrat Party bosses have installed a puppet candidate to fight only for themselves. Kamala Harris got zero votes. [crowd boos] She's totally scripted, owned, and controlled by the donors and the power brokers who created her campaign and who rip off our government and make billions and billions of dollars. They want to call them up, and they want to—they want to deal with her. And I didn't deal like that. I never dealt like that. I didn't need the money. I said, ""No, I don't want to do that."" I told a lot of guys that I like and some guys that I don't like but very rich people, ""I just can't do that."" I can't do it. They want to do the telephone systems. They want to do lots of little things like that. ""We'd like to take over the telephone system of the United States."" ""I'm sorry, I can't do that."" But unlike her, I cannot be bought and I cannot be controlled. I have no interest in that. My only loyalty is to you, the people. And you know that. I could have had such a nice easy life. I could be at a nice place right now relaxing, watching the waves breaking, but I'd rather be right here in Harrisburg with you—the people that built our country. You're the people that built our country. I mean, some people don't like saying that. But you are, indeed, the people that built the country. We have—no matter where we go, we have the most incredible people. After lying to the country for years about Joe Biden's mental and physical condition, Kamala is now being given a personality makeover. Don't forget, four weeks ago, she was like considered the worst, not smart, terrible, the worst vice president in history. He's the worst president we've ever had, but they were considered terrible. And all of a sudden, she's the new Margaret Thatcher. That wouldn't happen, right? The great Margaret Thatcher. No, I don't think so. But you're going to—you're going to learn little things like defund the police. That doesn't work, does it? [booing] You're going to learn. Because everything about Kamala Harris rollout, it's phony and it's fake. Did you see when President Obama and Michelle called? Did you see? ""Hello. Hello. Yes. Yes. Who is this?"" ""Oh, this is Michelle and Barack."" ""Oh. Oh."" So surprised to hear. They got four cameras in front. ""Oh, I'm so surprised."" It's on speakerphone. Listen, we just want to congratulate you on destroying Joe Biden—I mean, on winning the—Hey, is Joe Biden—was that the phoniest phone call you've ever seen? CROWD: YES! TRUMP: What don't you think, Dan? What do you think? Dan Meuser, great congressman. What do you think? Was that a phony phone call? You wouldn't do it. You wouldn't get away. In your district, you wouldn't get away with it, would you? But she's a defund-the-police radical trying to pass herself off as a tough-on-crime prosecutor. She wasn't tough on crime. She's only tough on guys like me because they want to go after their political opponents. And we won the big case in Florida. Did you see? We won it. And he—and he had a similar case, but it was much worse, and he didn't have the Presidential Records Act. He had a similar case. And, you know, the special counsel, which is basically a special prosecutor, adjudged him to be essentially mentally incompetent, with poor memory, but a nice old guy. He's not old. You know, 81 is not old. I have friends that are 95 that are still—Bernie Marcus, founder of Home Depot, 95 years old, still sharp—still sharp. I spoke to him the other day. I said, ""I think you're smarter now than you were 30 years ago."" I don't know what's going on. I said, ""What's going on, it's working for you."" Eighty-one is not old. And—but he's different. He's a—he's a bad 81. He's a bad 81. And he's ruining—he destroyed—he's destroying our country, I'll tell you. And she's worse than he is. She is actually worse than he is because she's a real radical left. He's a phony radical left. He didn't believe this stuff. He didn't believe in open borders, and she does. She wants to open your borders. She wants to have all-electric cars. She loves the all-electric car mandate. She destroyed San Francisco. But she's the architect of the border invasion, trying to pretend she's strong on border security. She's now pretending that she was never called the border czar. She was called the border czar the first day. She's the border czar, and she never went. She actually went. You know, they say—they fact-check me. Anything I say is like a little—she actually went to a beautiful part of the border. I would love to take my first lady wife there to have dinner. It's beautiful, very safe. No, she didn't go to the real border, did she, front-row joe? She went—she went to a nice little place, was there for a short period of time and left. So, she's never really been to the border, and she's the border czar. And our country is being invaded with people from prisons and people from mental institutions and terrorists. She's a failed vice president leading a failed administration while trying to convince you that she represents hope and change. Well, she does represent change. She wants to turn us into a communist country. That's her change. [booing] She was voted the most unpopular vice president in history. That's hard for a vice president to be that unpopular, right? Just like Biden will go down as the single worst president in the history of our nation. The happiest man is Jimmy Carter. He's an old guy right now. He's an old guy, but he's happy because his administration is considered brilliant, brilliant by comparison to this disaster that we have right now. In her speech in Atlanta last night, Kamala Harris even tried to out-brand a new Southern accent. Did you hear her new accent? If I ever did that, all of those people back there—look at that, look at all those cameras. [booing] That's—oh, would I go through hell—I'd have a week of hell if I ever tried to do that. The contrast could not be more stark. On the one hand, you have a radical left puppet candidate who is fake, fake, fake. And on the other hand, you have a president who will fight, fight, fight for America, right? [cheers and applause] CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! TRUMP: This is a hell of a big arena. How many seats—this looks like Madison Square Garden. This is a big—this is a big, beautiful place. Wow. I didn't care. I didn't care, although they'd prefer that we be in an arena. I don't know why. But we're not giving up the outdoor rallies. You know, all those people that we had to turn away today, at an outdoor rally, you can have—we had 107,000 people show up in New Jersey, 107,000. But, you know, in the South Bronx, we had 25,000 people. It was like a lovefest. South Bronx, tough place, but it was a lot of love. No matter how much Kamala Harris tries to change her image, she cannot change this fact: She is the most extreme liberal candidate in the history of our country by far. She's an extreme radical left lunatic. And, you know, I've been saying for the last six months, I've been saying about politicians—because I really know politicians. Well, I've dealt with them on both sides. And, you know, then I said, ""Let's do this, you know —"" Thank you. But when a politician comes out early on with an idea like she wants to defund the police and all these other things she wants to do, really bad things, that's where they're at. They're going to be there eventually, right? Mike Kelly. Stand up, Mike, will you, please? This guy, he used to stand up—he's my friend. He endorsed me on day one, right? Day one, day one. He endorsed me before I was running. He said, ""That guy's got to run. I endorse him."" I didn't even run. I had—""How many endorsements do I have?"" ""Well, you got Kelly of Pennsylvania."" I wasn't running. Anyway, thank you, Mike. I appreciate it. He was—he would stand out at those outdoor rallies when it was 10 degrees below zero and it was 97 degrees out, without a shirt on. It's not that pretty a sight, not that pretty, but he would have—he had no fear. He's a tough guy, and they love him. They love you in this state. Kamala Harris co-sponsored Bernie Sanders' $32 trillion socialist takeover of the entire U.S. health core—care system. Think of this, U.S. health care, it would mean that we're going to have to raise your taxes, bankrupt our country, and she supported outlawing all of the private health insurance. A lot of people in this room have great—some people want private health. It's—some of it is incredible. You go to these companies; they're doing an incredible job. They want to be able to—she wants that banned, and she wants that outlawed. You can't buy that anymore. You're paying for it. But it's great stuff. I mean, some of the companies have unbelievable—the golden plans and all that, and she wants it to be ended. She pledged to give free taxpayer-funded health care to all illegal aliens. Think of that. [booing] Oh, and she'll do that, which will totally destroy our Social Security system. She sponsored a bill to give illegal aliens taxpayer-funded lawyers so they could sue us. [booing] And she called for abolishing ICE. These are unbelievable patriots, by the way. They're almost as tough as our congressmen sitting in the front. They're almost as tough as the man that's going to be your next governor, by the way. He's tough, too. He's tough. He's a great military hero, and he'll come up—I'm allowed to have him up for a little while, right? Just a couple of minutes, right? He's great. He's great. And I hear you're doing very well. But you get ready. You get it ready. You got to knock them dead. She compared ICE agents to members of the KKK. She likened Border Patrol agents to practitioners of human slavery. We have a lot of those great people here tonight like Brandon Judd, the head of the union, Paul. We have so many different people, and they didn't like that analogy too much. She voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities numerous times. She supports open borders. That's all you'd have to hear. I think two words. You know, they say, ""Sir, go down the list. We have a list of 25 things."" All you have to say is two things: open borders, defund the police. The rest is all—but, you know—although she is going to kill Social Security because by putting all of these illegal aliens into Social Security, it's dead. It's dead. She opposes even saying the words illegal alien and radical Islamic terrorists. She backs mass amnesty, mass amnesty and citizenship for all illegals. She supports mandatory gun confiscation. Would anybody mind—[booing] Mr. Congressman, would they mind having their guns ripped out of their arms as they enter their house or their apartment? I don't think so. I don't think. She said that 70 percent to 80 percent tax rate is ""a very bold idea, something that we have to discuss very seriously."" She likes it. And, you know, all my life, I watched politicians, and they've always said, ""We will reduce your taxes. We will reduce your taxes. We will cut your taxes."" They want to give you a tax increase of five times what you're paying now. How the hell do you get elected? This country is so screwed up. Everything's backwards. We want open border. We want taxing. How do you like to be a politician? We want open borders. We want tax increases. We want all-electric cars so that you can go 15 minutes before you charge it up. And for all the congressmen that are here, in the Midwest, they built eight charging stations. Now, you know what that is? That's like a gas pump with electricity coming out, just a charging terminal. It cost $9 billion. Did you hear that, Mike? Did you hear that? Scott, oh, you—I said he's another tough—we got tough congressmen here. These are—these are tough cookies, these Pennsylvania guys. Wow. Look at that. We're going to introduce them in a second. Scott. So, they spent $9 billion on eight charging stations, two of which never worked. I don't think any of them work. She wants government intervention to slash consumption of red meat. They don't want red meat. That means they don't want your cows. Get rid of your cows. We like—does anybody—would anybody like to keep red meat? Raise your hand. [cheers and applause] You know, think of it, borders, and electric mandate and all of the things, red meat, how the hell do you get elected, right? You know how they got elected? By cheating. They got elected by cheating because nobody—they want to raise your taxes by five times. ""Oh, please vote for me. I'm going to raise your taxes five times higher."" But the red meat is to fight climate change, OK? Climate change. She supports ending cash bail to immediately release criminals upon arrest. They kill somebody. ""No bail? Don't worry about it. No cash. You know, you just killed three people. No, let's let them out in Harrisburg. It's a wonderful place."" And in 2020, she personally urged her followers to donate money to bail out the violent rioters, get them right out of jail, including murderers. You know what that was all about, right? In Minnesota, which I think we have a good chance of winning. Hasn't been won since 1972 by a Republican. And we're leading. Tom Emmer is going to bring that one home. They tell me he's going to bring it home. This November, the American people are going to reject Kamala Harris' dangerous liberal extremism in a massive landslide. We're going to too big to rig, right? Too big to rig. Too big—too big to rig. We're not going to let her turn the United States into a communist San Francisco colony. We're not going to let it happen. That's what they want to do. They want to destroy our country. She's the worst. She was a bad DA long before you had your DA, long before you had some of these DAs that you have, as you know, in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, but in Los Angeles, all over the place. All over the place, you have bad DAs. You have radical left, horrible DAs that are funded by Soros and others, and they're weak—they're just weak on crime. They don't mind if somebody murders somebody. They don't want them to go to jail. You can kill somebody now—our country is sick. The mindset of our country is sick. And we're not going to let her do to Pennsylvania what she did to California. She destroyed San Francisco, one of the best cities in the world, and it's in tatters. So, she's a liberal from California. She ruined the state. She ruined this great—one of the greatest cities in the world. You know, 15 years ago, a great friend of mine, Bob Tisch, great guy who's an owner of the New York Giants and a very smart guy, a wonderful guy, too. Maybe even longer—a little longer than 15, he said San Francisco is the best city in our country. And today, it's a disaster. It's just a disaster. He passed away quite a while ago, and he would look down and say, ""What the hell happened to that city?"" But he thought San Francisco was one of the greats. He thought Chicago was one of the greats. You know, Chicago, on July Fourth weekend, had 117 shootings and 17 people died. Think of it. This is not even believable. When you hear about Afghanistan and the horrible job that this president did with Afghanistan, a low point, but they don't have—they don't have anything like that. In one of the most astoundingly phony moments in her speech last night, Kamala Harris bragged that ""I will proudly put my record against Donald Trump's any day of the week. I will put it against Donald Trump."" This—this—she's got one of the worst records in anywhere. Well, Kamala, let's go, challenge accepted. Are you ready? Let's compare our record point by point. [cheers and applause] Mike. I can't believe I'm doing it. You know, the weird thing—I mean, two weeks ago, I was talking about Biden. I didn't even know her name. Nobody did. Kamala. Hello. Beautiful. I didn't even know her name. Kamala. I heard she was a rotten border czar. That's about all I knew about her. Her only job was the border, and she never went there. But two weeks ago, three weeks ago, it was all about Biden. Then I kept hearing they were going to steal it from him. And I said, ""You know, it's hard to do."" Because I understand, when you have the delegates—he had all the delegates. He had 100 % of the delegates. He had 14 million votes. I said, ""You can't really do it."" But then they threatened him very strongly. They said, ""You're incompetent, and we're going to get you out."" He just won; you know. No, they happened to be right. He was incompetent, but these are minor details. No, he just won. He had all the votes. And he could have said no, but he was afraid. And he's an angry man right now. Here's the big question I have, will he be invited to the Democrat National Convention? Will he be invited, Mr. Congressman? I don't know. Now, he will be because I'm mentioning it. If I didn't mention it, he would not be invited. But now, they have to invite him. But you know what's crazy, the craziest thing? So, you don't mind if I go off teleprompter all the time. It's such a shame. I have these great speechwriters; they really are Ross and Vince. They're great. They're the best speechwriters. And I—you know, I hardly speak about this, but I could read the most gorgeous speech, but you may be bored to tears. No, it's—they're beautiful. The words are beautiful. Everything's great. The sun will rise. The moon will set. The oceans will glisten. I say that's beautiful, but I'm not sure that Harrisburg wants to hear that stuff. What do you think, Congressman? What do you think, Doctor? I don't think so. No, they are great, but I tend to—I tend to go off about 75 percent of the time. But, you know, the hard part is that three or four weeks ago, I was talking about Biden. He's incompetent. He's a horrible president. He's the worst president in the history of the country. Now, I say she's the worst vice president, which is true. She's considered the worst. She's the most unpopular vice president in the history of the country. She did a transformation. You know the press is very corrupt. You know that. They gave her a transformation [booing] like Houdini. That was a Houdini-like—that was a magic trick. But don't worry. She's going to fall because it's not about him or her. It's about the policies. They're the same, and they're horrible, right? But they gave her—so, you know, it's sort of like—I don't know if anybody watch UFC as an example. Do you watch it, right? Dana White, the great Dana White. Did you see him? He introduced me the other—he introduced me the other day at our convention. We had the greatest convention in the history of politics, in my opinion. Thank you, Milwaukee and Wisconsin. And the arena was beautiful. It was an unbelievable—but Dana White introduced me. And he heads up UFC. He's done an incredible job. But it's almost like you're having a fight between two guys and one guy is getting beat up bad. Then he goes to a debate, right? The debate didn't work out too well. How did the debate work out for him? I don't think so good, Scott. The debate didn't work out exactly good. Then he tried to recover from the debate by going out every day, and it got worse and worse. It was a basic disaster. But it's like having two fighters, and the one guy is getting beat up really badly, really—and they say, ""All right. Stop the fight. Come on out. I'll put a new one in."" That's what we have here. Kamala is the new fighter. Who cares? Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history. You know that because you didn't have people sleeping on your lawn all night. We ended catch and release. We stopped asylum, fraud, coal. We got Remain in Mexico. Remember that one? Do you think that was easy to get? I call up the president of Mexico, a friend of mine. He's a socialist, but still he was a friend of mine. He gave us many, many thousands of troops to guard our border while we were building the wall. I built hundreds of miles of wall, and then they didn't want to finish it up, which could have taken place very quickly. But think of it. But, you know, we got Remain—think of it, Remain in Mexico. That means you can't come into our country. You have to remain in Mexico until you get approved, of which very few people got approved. Do you think that was easy? That wasn't easy. Negotiated historic Safe Third Agreements, which are complex, I won't waste your time, but they were great, with Central American nations. Built 571 miles, think of that, of border wall. We're going to add another 200. Far more than I said I was going to build. And it was working. It was working. It was good. We had the best illegal immigration nonflow I call it. We had—they don't—they were having a hard time. Also, drugs were way down. Human trafficking was way down. It's human trafficking and human trafficking in women mostly. You know, it sounds ancient, human trafficking. It sounds like something from a thousand years ago, but it's as big a business, in a sense, as the drug business. And the reason is because of the internet. The internet made human trafficking a very, very big and horrible business. They traffic in women. They put them in the trunk of a car, they put them in the back seat, and they'd close it up, and you can't even breathe, and they bring them—they bring them across the border. We had knocked it down cold. And now, it's at a level five times greater than it ever was before. Nobody's there to check. Nobody's to look at the car. Nobody knows who's there, who's in it. But you can see it on a certain chart that I have. You know, this chart saved my life. Where is that chart? [cheers and applause] I love that chart. I'm going to sleep with that chart for the rest of my life, that chart, that chart. You know the amazing thing? You know, the people that operate the—the computers and all the brilliant equipment we have backstage. She said to me—she's great. She's great. She should come out. Just tell her to come out here for a second. Quick, quick, quick, quick. You got to get her out. She's never done this before. She saved my life, in a sense. I said you saved my life. Here she is. Wow. Wow. [cheers and applause] Wow. Thank you. You're going to say something? You saved my life. UNNAMED TRUMP STAFFER: Hi. TRUMP: Thank you. No, she's a computer genius—she saved my life. No. So, you know the stories, but that chart, I only used it probably less than 20 percent of the time. So, in other words, we do the rallies and stuff, sometimes I'll pull it down, sometimes I won't because I do things a little bit at random while I'm up here. Hello. Look at that big fella back there. But I do things a little bit at random. But two things about the chart. It's always on my left, which means I'm gone. It's always on my left. If it was on my left, I have, Mr. Governor—Mr. Future Governor, I have no chance because it would have been perfect, perfect hit. And it's only used a little bit. And I always use it at the end of a speech. I never used it early. In fact, she was saying today, ""It was so—we were really sort of flabbergasted because you called for it at the very beginning of your speech."" And that chart, I'm so proud of it. Now, I like it much more than I liked it before. But see the arrow on the bottom? [gestures to screen] That's the lowest level of illegal immigration in the history of our country recorded, and that was the last week of my presidency, Mike. So, that was the last week. And look what happened to our country after that. And those are now a little bit old because if you look on the right, it's a little bit old. Those numbers are much higher. They, right now, would go off the ceiling. And that's what happened to our country in a short period of time, three and a half years. But look at that number and look at that arrow. So, anyway, much more importantly right now, I say—I'm talking about illegal immigration real quick. I said, ""You know what, pull up the chart. Pull it up."" And they weren't ready because—but they're so good. And I said, ""Wow, that was so quick."" There's nobody over here except for this lunatic. And because the crowd was massive, as far as the eye could see, as far as—I mean, that's why I love those outdoor sites because you don't have to send 20,000 people back home. And I hate to do that. They come out, and they want to get in, and then you get the seats. Would anybody like to give up your seat? CROWD: NO! TRUMP: I thought you were nicer people than that in Pennsylvania. Anyway, so—so I—I say chart, and I go like this, ""And the chart —"" Pew. [gestures shooting gun] So, a couple of things. She—she told me today, she said, ""You know, the amazing thing is you always call for the chart at the end of the speech, not the beginning."" So, that was one factor that's crazy. ""It's always on your left, not your right."" It happened to be on the right this time. I don't think I've ever seen it on the right. And various other things. And if I'm here, it's over. If I'm here, it's no good. If I'm—I had to be exactly—because he was exactly where that very beautiful woman in the white is, right? Stand up. That's exactly. And my son said that's not a long distance, 100. I don't know so much about shooting other than I'm very good for the Second Amendment, I can tell you, but I don't know so much about shooting. But I know about sports. I know about golf. He said, ""That's like sinking a two-foot putt, Dad."" That would be the equivalent. Is that right? He actually said it might be less than that because some people can't sink a two-foot putt like Biden. I would say Biden. Biden can't sink. But—but that's like sinking—did anybody see the Bryson DeChambeau thing? Did you? CROWD: YES! TRUMP: That was cool. We had a good time. He's a great guy, great young athlete. So, all these things, and, you know, then you figure what are the odds that that happened, right, where you're just—you're literally exactly there. You hadn't made the full turn. But that chart will always be my world's most favorite chart for a lot of reasons. Number one is that day in Butler, Pennsylvania, and number two is look at those numbers. That was the lowest number of illegal aliens that we've ever had. So, it really was a very important—that was a very important thing. It was done by Border Patrol. Now, let's examine the record of Border Czar Harris. She inherited the strongest border in US history and immediately turned it into the worst border nightmare in the history of the world. There's no country in the world that's ever had a border like this. I think the real number is 20 million people, maybe more. Nobody knows. You know, you have a thing called gotaways. We have millions of gotaways, meaning people that weren't caught. They"," got away. Upon taking office, Harris and Biden stopped wall construction; halted all deportations; protected sanctuary cities; ended Remain in Mexico and our asylum cooperation agreements, which are very important; and allowed a gigantic invasion of our country, bringing in millions and millions of illegal aliens at levels never seen before. Now, actually, other than that, I thought she was doing a very good job, right? She's done a wonderful job. She's the worst ever, and she's going to be your president? You'll—she will destroy our country. This November, the American people are going to compare these records, and they're going to tell Border Czar Harris, ""You have done a horrible job. You're a disgrace to our country. You're fired. Get out of here. You're fired. Get out. Get the hell out of here."" But Kamala is protected by the fake news. [booing] They're trying to delete everything she said. Hey, did you ever see the unselect committee? The unselect committee, on January 6th, did you see where they went and deleted and destroyed all evidence? It was deleted and destroyed. So, I think, Dan, you, and all of my friends here, should be indicted for that. They destroyed evidence. You know why? Because the evidence showed that we were innocent. The evidence showed that Nancy Pelosi should have had protection at the Capitol that I offered her and they turned it down. The evidence showed that all these stories were fake, including me wanting to grab a big strong Secret Service agent around the neck. Think of—think of this. Think of this. I'm in a car. I say, ""Fellas, I'd love to go down to the Capitol."" ""Sir, we don't think it's good because, you know, you're very exposed to all of that."" So, OK. I said, ""You don't think we can —"" ""No."" So, I said, ""All right. Where do you want to go?"" ""We'll go back to the White House."" That's the experience. This one person had me getting extremely upset. I don't get upset. When somebody smart says, ""Sir, you're probably better —"" and nothing was happening, just people were walking down, remember, patriotically, right? CROWD MEMBER: Yeah! That's right! TRUMP: Right? Right? So, they had me coming from the back of the car. Now, these guys are very strong. They're young and strong. Not as strong as me, but they're strong. And I grabbed the one guy driving, and he got arms—he's got arms like this. I grabbed him, and I was rebuffed. And then I went over to the right. And I think he's like a world champion karate guy, right? Like a very tough cookie. Bobby. His name is Bobby. That's all I know, but I know him well. He's a good guy. And I grabbed him around the neck, and I began to twist and turn. And he was in tremendous pain because of the power of Trump, tremendous pain. And then I went back to the White House, and I started throwing hamburgers at the wall. This is the story this person told. So, they went to the Secret Service, they found out it was all bullshit. [cheers and applause] Everything. All made up. It was just made up, which most people—I mean, honestly, most people would think that. You know, think of me grabbing these two strong tough guys. That's what they do. The one guy said, ""You know, if I ever—if somebody ever put their arms around me —"" He's trained automatically to go with his fingers like that. [mimes gouging eyes] You know, it's what he's trained. Me, I like other things better personally. I'd like to run the country better. That's what I'd like to do, you know. They're good with the finger. They're good with their fingers into the eye, the fingers into the eye, and you have a tendency to immediately let go and—and—and get a towel and start crying because it hurts. They say, ""Oh, that hurts."" No, it was all made-up stuff. You know, it was all made-up stuff. But wouldn't you think it is? I mean, who would believe Trump was so angry, he grabbed the one guy who was rebuffed, then he grab the other one around the neck? These people are sick. Who would believe it? But probably some people do, even if it's five people. But no—but some people would believe it. You know, they hear it. They deleted everything because the stories turned out to be false. They deleted everything. Nancy Pelosi turned down 10,000 troops or National Guard. If we had 500, you wouldn't have had a problem. And what you never see is the crowd. The crowd was—it was the largest crowd I've ever spoken before. And a small portion walked peacefully and patriotically down to the Capitol. You remember the term? Peacefully and patriotically. ""He's horrible. It's insurrection."" You know, if you have an insurrection, you don't say peacefully and patriotically, right, Mike? You say let's go. No, they're—these are really bad people. These are crooked people. And then her daughter—you saw that about a month ago. Her daughter taped her, saying that it was her fault the day—their daughter is a cinematographer. I'm sure Nancy is thrilled. They just released a tape where Nancy is saying, ""This is my fault."" This is during the thing. Because she didn't accept my offer, she said, ""This is my fault. I could have stopped this."" Now, she's trying to say, well, she didn't really mean that. No, these are—these are bad people. They're trying to delete everything that she said over the last—think of it, this is on Kamala, it's no different, over the last 10 years that's controversial or bad. It's like defund the police, the fact that she was given authority over the border that—you know they're trying to say that under no circumstances was she even in charge of the border. And the fake news is trying to delete everything. Are you seeing what's going on? They're trying to delete everything. But, you know, it's a wonderful—the internet is wonderful in certain ways. We have every single copy of every article. But they're trying to delete it. Under crazy Kamala's policies—you know, when I got hit, everybody thought I was going to be a nice guy, and they thought I'd changed, remember, just before the Republican convention. And—and nobody thought I'd be there. You know, it's not great to be there when your ear is slightly throbbing. ""Let's go to the convention, darling,"" to the first lady. ""Let's go."" But I got there. Next day, I left, right? And it was the greatest convention. But—but—and it was like a convention like no other. It was a convention that we were all so proud of. But they all said, ""Trump is going to be a nice man now. He came close to death."" And I really agreed with that for about eight hours or so. And then I realized they were trying to put me in prison for doing absolutely nothing wrong. They went to judges who are crooked judges. They went to judges who are fake. They had prosecutors who are Democrat radical lefts and always in areas where it's like 3 percent Republican or less. And I said, ""You know, these are bad people."" So, I was nice for about, what would you say, Dan, three, four, or five hours, and then I said, ""These are bad people. We have to win this battle."" And you know what, they're going to become nicer when we win. But we're going to have to win, I believe, to make them reasonable because they are crazy. They are crazy. [cheers and applause] Under Kamala's policies, criminals, rapists, and vicious gang members are pouring in from South America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, from prisons, from jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums. You know, an insane asylum is a step above, right? This is—oh, they go crazy when they want to try and say he's cognitively impaired. You know, I stand up here for two hours, and I speak without a mistake. But when I say Hannibal Lecter, they say, ""Why does he keep mentioning —"" because Hannibal Lecter was a serious psycho, right? He was ""Silence of the Lambs."" Dr. Hannibal Lecter, he'd like to have you for dinner. See the man with the wall, stand up. Look at this guy. He's here so much. He's great. He's great. He's—He's a Trump voter. I don't think we have to worry about him, do we? He's a Trump voter all the way, but Hannibal Lecter would like to have you for dinner. But these people are now in our country. And they always—you know, actually, it's quite clever, I think. But, you know, what do you do? But they're always saying like, ""He mentions Hannibal Lecter. It doesn't make sense."" No, it makes a lot of sense. They're coming into our country, and they're coming in from insane asylums, which are closing all over the world, it's not just South America, because we have the worst people representing our country. They laugh at the stupidity of these people. All over the world, they're coming from the Congo in Africa. Twenty-two prisoners right out of prisons from the Congo in Africa. Not just South America. Meanwhile, our crime rate is going up. How about where they say, ""Our crime rate is going down."" We just had 117 people shot. You could take just Chicago and the whole nation's crime rate. Look, these are bad people. They're phony people, they're liars, they cheat on elections, they do a lot of bad things, and we have to win this election because crime statistics are a disaster. They're made up by people that work in the White House. And obviously, the crime is getting worse because we have probably 20 million people in our country right now. And every single day, you read about one of these horrible monsters from parts unknown who raped a young girl, killed her, cut them up, used his knives, not guns because it's a slower death. These are monsters, and we have them in our country. And we're going to deport them at a level like nobody's ever seen. We're going to get them the hell out of our country, and they're going back to the country from which they came. Because we have become a dumping ground for the world, and we're not going to take it anymore. We're going to get rid of these liberal lunatics like Kamala. Just yesterday, it was reported that more than 1,000 members of the savage Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua are plotting to conduct ambush attacks on police and law enforcement in the United States. All the while, Harris and Biden sit in the White House and try and figure out who's dumber. They sit in the White House. Think of it, massive—massive numbers of Venezuelan gang members. Now, Venezuela is very smart. They sent them into our country, and then you read that crime is down 72 percent in Venezuela, which it is. On Sunday, in a separate incident, a Venezuelan illegal alien criminal let in the border by our border czar, Harris, shot a female police officer in Texas, you read about it, multiple times with a rifle. Thankfully, the officer is perhaps going to survive. They don't know yet, but probably. But most victims are not so lucky. In Texas, last month, 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray was tied up, sexually assaulted, and strangled to death by two illegal aliens who Biden and Harris released into the United States. If Border Czar Harris stays in charge, every single week, we'll bring never-ending streams of illegal alien rapists, bloodthirsty killers, and child predators to go after our sons and our daughters and our wives and our husbands. They're letting horrible people into our country. They're poisoning—they're poisoning our country. By contrast, if I am elected, on day one, we will begin the largest deportation operation in American history and we will immediately deport all of the criminals that Border Czar Harris has allowed to enter our country. They'll be deported. But no comparison of our immigration records would be complete without considering the terrorists that this crazy border czar of ours is letting into America. By the way, can anybody imagine her as—in all fairness, we want to be politically correct and all that. Great. Who cares? Can anybody imagine her dealing with President Xi of China, who's a fierce individual, fierce person? You know, she was sent to deal with Putin to keep him from invading Ukraine, which, by the way, he would have never done if I were president. Israel wouldn't have been attacked. He would not have attacked Ukraine. The recent hits on Israel wouldn't have taken place. We wouldn't have had inflation. You wouldn't have had that horrible disaster in Afghanistan. None of these things would have happened. We'd be respected again. Now, we're laughed at. All over the world, they're laughing at us. When I was president, terror watchlist encounters at the border reached—one year—and I don't believe it. It was done by Border Patrol and ICE. They have one year where it was zero. They said—and I don't even believe that myself. But you know what, I'll take it because the charts are usually the other way. Zero. And then after—and it was part of that that we just looked at, but we had zero terrorists reported coming in in 2019. I believe the year was 2019. Zero. So, let's say it was 10 or 20. Now, it's thousands of people coming in. I never believed the zero, but I'll tell you, we'll take it. But assuming it was 10, 15, 20, thousands and thousands of terrorists are pouring into our country. Under Kamala Harris, thousands of terrorists have been let right in—right in. And according to news reports, the Biden-Harris administration has absolutely no idea who they are or where the hell they come from. Just come on into our country. But you're going to be finding this out. You're going to have to be thinking—you're going to have a migrant crime statistic that's going to rival anything that we've ever had. And the only thing good about these people—they're very tough people. They come out of those jails and those prisons and those mental institutions. The only thing that is really good about them is they make our criminals look like very nice people. It's true. Our criminals that we used to fear, we don't fear anymore, Doctor. They're like nice people compared to the people that are coming into our country. No candidate who would knowingly keep the border open as terrorists pour across it can ever be trusted to be commander in chief. You can't do it. You can't let her—you can't let it happen. If she becomes your president—and I think worse than Biden. I think worse than Biden. And he's gone. He's shot. But if she becomes your president, our country is finished, I'll tell you. And Pennsylvania, your beautiful commonwealth—it's always good when you remember it's a commonwealth. He would call it a state often. Remember when Biden used—I used to love this guy because you were on pins and needles watching him speak. You know, when is he going to blow it? And it would always happen. Remember, he'd finished his speech and he couldn't find the stair. [turns around and raises arms] And then these handsome men would run up and grab him and help him. And every time I imitated, the first lady tells me, ""Why—why do you keep doing that? Because they keep saying you can't find the stairs off the —"" You know, you've only got about nine stairways off the podium. But unlike Kamala Harris, I will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. We're going to keep them out. It's going to be safe. We're going to have a safe country. The fact is, four years ago, we were respected like never before. I would say like never before. We were respected by China, by Iran. Look at Iran. Iran is going wild now, aren't they? You know, Iran was broke when I was president. They didn't have money to give to Hamas. They didn't have money to give to Hezbollah. Do you see what's going on now with Hezbollah now? You're going to end up in a world war. You're going to end up in a third world war pretty soon with this—with this guy. Between Ukraine and Russia and the stupidity with—I will get that negotiated and end it before I ever take office. I'll do it after the election as president-elect. In addition to her atrocious record on border security, Kamala Harris would also obliterate Pennsylvania's economy. You know about that. She's against fracking. She's against oil drilling. She wants everybody to have one electric car and share it with the neighbors. Harris has stated repeatedly that she supports banning fracking. ""I ban fracking. I will ban it on my first day."" Now, she's denying it. Remember, a politician always goes back to what their original thought was, right? And she co-sponsored the $100 trillion green new scam designed to abolish the oil, coal, and natural gas industries entirely. We have more liquid gold under our feet than Saudi Arabia, than Russia by far. And under me, we took it—from fourth place and third place, we took it to first place by a lot. We were energy-independent, soon to be energy-dominant. We were going to make so much money, we're going to pay off debt and reduce your taxes still further. Now, you can't do anything with these lunatics. Under a Harris presidency, 423,000 Pennsylvania jobs are linked to fracking, they'd all be demolished. She's against fracking. She's not going to allow you to frack. She's not going to allow you to frack. And the only reason they're allowing it now—you know, they cut it way back. That's what caused the inflation. And then he opened it up again back to the Trump days. He opened it up to the same because it's similar because he wanted to try and get reelected. They didn't know his party was going to overthrow him. It was a coup. This was a coup of a president. He will be famous. He will be more famous for the coup than the bad job he's done, OK? But this was a coup of the president of the United States. This was a—like a South American—you know, you read about South America. Every week, they have a coup, and they also do the attacks on political opponents, by the way. Your economy would take a $41 billion hit, this is Pennsylvania, gutting billions of dollars from your state and local budgets, slashing funding for your schools and police forces, and plunging Pennsylvania into severe economic depression. Enjoy it. Look, if they get in, your state is screwed. Your state is—you guys are screwed. Good luck, everybody. Have a—have fun in Congress, Mike. But I will never let that happen. But you don't need to take my word for it alone. Kamala's anti-American energy crusade—let's just listen to her. Now, she's a totally—oh, no, I love fracking. Let's just see what her video says. She had a tape just a little while ago. Let's go. [start of pre-recorded video] INTERVIEWER: Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice? KAMALA HARRIS: There's no question, I'm in favor of banning fracking. [booing] [end of pre-recorded video] TRUMP: OK? If I said that, nobody would believe it. So—and that's where she is. She's a radical left person who destroyed San Francisco, and she'll destroy the country just like she did California and San Francisco. She was the leader of that pack that destroyed San Francisco. It's not only Gavin New-scum. Gavin New-scum, he's another beauty. Oh, we're doing great in the state. Everyone's leaving. ""We're doing great. The state's doing wonderfully."" They do have wonderful weather and it's a beautiful place, but it's overridden with crime. He is doing such a terrible job. He's a con man. You know, I watched him in the great Sean Hannity Show, and he was in, saying like ""No, the state has never done better. Never done —"" It's all fake. It's all lies. The state is a disaster. They're moving to Texas, Florida, Tennessee. They're moving to a lot of North Carolina, South Carolina. When we win this November, we will end the Biden-Harris war on American energy and we will end their terrible war on fracking. Fracking is incredible, the money you make in Pennsylvania. You could quadruple your taxes if you—if you lost that industry, you could quadruple your taxes. The policy of the Trump administration will be to drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause] Right? Right? I will also terminate the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate on day one and save the US auto industry from destruction. We are going to rebuild our auto industry. And the United Auto Workers are mostly going to vote for me, but, you know, they have a head of the United Auto Workers who's a fool. He's giving our auto industry to China by allowing this electric mandate to even be thought of. And again, I'm all for electric cars. There's a certain little section that wants to have electric. I can understand that. But it's a small section. They want to have gasoline-powered cars, they want to have hybrids, and they're going to have that. They don't want to stop every 15 minutes. They refuse to stop. You know, I have a friend of mine, got an electric car, and he was used to driving from Kentucky, great state, to Washington. And he drive, and, you know, he'd drive it. That would be it. Now, he's driving it. He had to stop six times. He said, ""What the hell is going on?"" He thought it was good for the environment. It's not good for—you know, he's an idealistic kind of guy. I think I'm going to do something good for the environment. He got rid of that thing so fast; your head would spin. And it's great if you want to go to the candy store and back. Then you plug it in in your garage. It's no wonder the Democrat Party and their thugs are so desperate to stop us. They know that we are the only ones who can stop them, the only ones. You know, this is a movement—Make America Great Again. This is a movement, the likes of which no country, but our country has never seen before. MAGA. MAGA. No country has ever seen anything like it. Remember when Biden would get up, ""We will stop MAGA."" He had no idea. I said, ""Joe, do you know what it means?"" ""No, not really."" No, it means Make America Great Again. We don't want to stop it. All of their persecution is only happening because I am running for president and leading big in the polls. Oh, if I wasn't, I wouldn't have any of these lawsuits. Oh, they wouldn't be suing me because I'm breaking their ass, also. They wouldn't be suing me. They're doing this because I'm running and I'm leading, and I'm leading by a lot. We're leading by a lot in this state, by the way, in this commonwealth. We're leading by a lot in our commonwealth. The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024. We're not going to allow it to happen. And every time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, communists, and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor. Thank you very much. Because I'm being indicted for you. Did you like my mugshot? Did you like the mugshot? Lovely. My father's looking down—my mother and father, they're looking down because they're definitely in heaven. They made heaven. They're great. They're looking down, they said, ""I can't believe my son took a mugshot. This is unbelievable."" But it's the No. 1 selling mugshot in history. It beat Elvis and it beat Frank Sinatra. Did you know that? Frank Sinatra had a big one. Did you know he got arrested for something? And I think Elvis had a fight at a gas station or something. But Elvis was one. Frank Sinatra was two. And I'm proud to admit and I'm proud to tell you that you have made mine bigger than both of them by a lot. It's the biggest-selling mug shot ever. And I still haven't figured out whether or not I'm happy about it. I'm not sure. In one way, I'm thrilled. In another way, I'm not sure I like it. Never forget, our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom, which is true. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. And in the end, they are not after me, they're after you. I just happened to be standing in their way, and I will continue to stand in their way. [cheers and applause] I will always be here. I'll be here. I don't know, I'm getting tired of protecting you, but I love it. [laughs] We're going to protect you. We're going to go. And soon, you won't need protection because, soon, you're going to have a great country again. It's true. You won't need protection. The country will protect you. But think of it. I say this to—I got indicted more than Al Capone, the great Al Capone. Can you imagine? Al Capone, Scarface, the meanest man you've ever met, I have him beat. But we're pleased to be joined today by some fantastic Pennsylvania patriots, friends of mine, incredible people, starting with the next US senator from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, David McCormick. He's incredible. He's a—come up. David, come up here. Come. He's a military hero. And honestly, you know, your senator, I don't think I ever met him in four years. Nobody knows who he is. It's the weirdest thing. It's almost like how they keep getting elected. You got to elect this guy. He's a war hero. He's a national hero. He's a brilliant man. He went out, he made a fortune, and all that stuff. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. It means he's smart, right? Do we agree? It means he's smart. You guys didn't make that much, but you're very smart anyway. But David has been a friend of mine. He's an incredible man and respected all over the place. And—and, you know, you have one chance to get a guy like this in. A lot of people, after watching my experience, they're not doing this anymore, are they? So, I'd like to introduce Dave McCormick, a great guy. Hopefully, he's going to be your next senator. You're going to win, and you're going to win big, David. DAVE MCCORMICK: Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, President Trump. Thank you so much, all of you. And listen, in Pennsylvania, we know, Mr. President, this is the most important election of our lifetime. We know it. And we also know that this is ground zero, which is going to put you back in the White House and the majority in the Senate. Right here, sir. Right here in Pennsylvania. And I want to welcome you back to Pennsylvania after Butler. We're so glad you're here, sir. Thank you. Thank you for being here. And I want to say what you all know, which is this is an incredibly important choice because we can continue to have the failed horrible policies of Biden, Harris, and Casey, and I say Casey because he votes 98 percent of the time, that destroys our economy: open borders, the fentanyl crisis, crime, the war on fossil fuels. But it only gets worse. It only gets worse under Harris-Casey. It only gets worse, and that is why we need strong leadership, common sense leadership. And when I go on the campaign trail, Mr. President, the thing I hear that people want most is strength. And I tell them, listen, I'm a combat veteran, I'm an army wrestler. And when I was standing there in Butler and saw those bullets flying, and I've seen people get shot at before, and you came up and put that fist in the air and said, ""Fight, fight, fight,"" I said to everybody, ""That strength, that's what we need for America. That's why we're going to win on November 5th."" God bless this commonwealth. [cheers and applause] TRUMP: Thank you. Wow. Wow. That's great. You know, David, it is true. David was in Butler, and he was sitting exactly there. And, you know, Corey was sitting right behind him. Can you imagine? Corey was killed. He was sitting right behind David. And David didn't flinch. He didn't move. I mean, some people moved. Actually, I think it was really known that when bullets are fired in a stadium, everyone really gets moving fast. They call it a stampede. Nobody moved. You looked at the people behind me, right? Everyone seen those people. Those people have become legendary. That was just a small group, the main tens of thousands of people around here, you couldn't even see the end, nobody ran, nobody moved. They knew I was in trouble. They said, ""He's in trouble."" Every—if you went to a soccer stadium where you'll have a bullet go off, one bullet, the whole place runs for the exits. Nobody ran. And how about the man behind me with the black outfit and the green floppy hat? He's like this. David, did you see him? He's — CROWD MEMBER: He's right there. CROWD MEMBER: He's here. TRUMP: He's staring. He's looking, right? Where? Get up here. Is that him? Yes. Wow. That's great, huh? Well, you're—you can be in a foxhole with me anytime, man. [steps away from podium] Wow. Thank you. That's great. That was a hell of a day, huh? But there were a number of them back there. They were just brave. Everybody. There was nobody that fled. I think—I think nobody fled, right? They were brave people, and they were looking and they were pointing. They saw it. They were pointing. It was incredible. And one of these crowd control people that came in afterwards said they've never seen it where bullets are fired—and I'll tell you something, David was standing and sitting right—literally, the bullets were going over your head. They were going over my head, too, the second group. But you weren't a flincher either, were you? You weren't. And Corey right alongside of you, right behind him. And you got to vote for this man. He's a hero and he's a great gentleman. He'll be a great senator. And it's time for a change. It's time for a change. I mean that. A vote for Dave McCormick is a vote to seal our borders, stop migrant crime, defeat inflation, bring down prices, and defend Pennsylvania energy. You have to defend your energy. They will not allow fracking. As soon as—if they got in, her first move will be to end fracking all throughout the United States. Dave is running against truly a not-a-good member. I don't like to be disrespectful. He's been there a long time. But Bob Casey is a stiff. He's a stiff. Nobody—nobody knows who the hell he is. I don't think I've ever gone to a meeting where he's been in the meeting, Mike. Mike has been in the meeting. Dan has been in the meeting. Scott is at too many meetings, right? No, I don't think I've ever been—I don't think I've ever been to a meeting where Casey has even been there, and I've been to a lot of meetings w","ith a lot of senators. But, you know, he just sort of goes along year after year. His father was there. He's there. We want to have a great warrior. Dave, good luck. Good luck. Thank you, David. Vote for him. We're pleased to be joined today by some really fantastic people. Some, I would say, truly great warriors. And if you could, maybe Congress people, just stand up, right? Just stand up. Scott Perry, Mike Kelly, GT Thompson. GT, hi. Dan Meuser, Lloyd Smucker. These are unbelievable warriors. These are great fighters. And if you can add David, it's going to be an unbeatable combination. Pennsylvania treasurer—thank you very much, fellas. You've done a great job. You've done a great job. Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity, Lancaster County Commissioner Josh Parsons. Great job, Josh. Jim Worthington, who's a fantastic man. Thank you. Thank you, Jim. Nice to see you. And two people that are amazing, very talented—very talented, very incredible people. One is a spokesman for the—lawyer, by the way, but a great spokesman, truly committed to make America great and me, but truly committed to make America great, which is more important than me, far more important. I mean, it's just something special. She has been an incredible person going around and—and letting people know how important our country is, how we love our country. Alina Habba. Alina. Stand up, Alina. I didn't know she was going to be here today. [cheers and applause] And another person, one of the most talented writers, a person who truly has the pulse of this area, Pennsylvania, and the Rust Belt, in general—the Rust Belt is her territory. Nobody covers it better. Salena Zito. Salena. Where are you, Salena? Where are you? Thank you. She's a great—she's a great writer. We're also joined by Tiffany Hall, a single mother of four from Columbia, Pennsylvania who wants to tell us firsthand what the Biden-Harris inflation nightmare has done to her family. It's destroyed her family. Tiffany, please come up. Please. Thank you. Thank you, Tiffany. This is happening all over America because of inflation, by the way. Thanks, Tiffany. Thank you, darling. Go have fun. [Off-mic] That's OK. Go. Here you go. TIFFANY HALL: Thank you very much. So, gas prices are just astronomical. Being able to afford anything for my children anymore like sports is just kind of out of the question now. When President Trump was in, I could do these things with them. Since then, I have not been able to. I can't put them into sports. I can't go on extravagant vacations anymore. We can go to free parks around here. I—I miss it. I miss when we didn't have to pull out of our pockets for things. I'm hoping we can get back to a point where I'm financially stable — TRUMP: You will. HALL: And others. I know I can't be the only one. We're all going to the gas pump and being like, man, here goes the last of what I have. I don't know. [applause] Thank you. I would like to be able to go into a grocery store again and not have to put something back or say, ""Nope, we can't do a nice cake from the bakery. We have to try and do one from home."" So, I really hope and pray that we can make America great again and get you back in office. [steps away from podium] Thank you. Thank you. TRUMP: Wow. Thank you, Tiffany. So, cute. You know, she said, ""Oh, I can't believe it. I left my notes down —"" on her seat. I said just go and wing it, and she did better. You did better than if you had your notes, Tiffany. I have to be honest. That's great. You did better. Thank you. Appreciate it. Things like that happen. I said, ""Well, give it a shot."" She did better. Starting on day one of the Trump administration, we will end inflation and we will make America great again. We will deliver regulation cuts, energy price cuts, interest rate cuts, and we will drive prices down, and we'll drive them down very fast. We will pass massive tax cuts for workers, and that includes no tax on tips. [cheers and applause] To protect Pennsylvania jobs, I will revoke China's most favored nation trade status. I will pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. If China or any other country makes us pay a 100 percent or 200 percent tariff or tax, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff or tax of 100 percent or 200 percent right back. You hurt us and we hurt you. It's an eye for an eye. Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, and it's we win the presidency, I mean that, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. [cheers and applause] And I am the only one that can say that. I know all the players, and they respect us, they respect me. And they used to respect our country but no longer. I will prevent World War III. That's where we're heading. We're heading to World War III, and you see it. I will restore peace through strength. Over and over again, our enemies have watched Biden and Harris signal a lack of will, total weakness to do what's necessary to protect American people and stand up for our allies. A week ago, the prime minister of our closest Middle Eastern ally, Israel, came to address Congress. You saw that. Instead of sending a clear signal that the United States will never abandon an ally, a very important one, Kamala chose to politicize the moment, to grandstand, making a show of refusing to attend. You know where she was? She went to a sorority party. Can you believe it? Even though it was her duty as president of the Senate to be there. It was her duty to be there. Her Democrat allies fell in line. Chuck Schumer refused to shake the Israeli prime minister's hand. Chuck Schumer has become a Palestinian. Yes, he has. Can you believe it? He's become a proud member of Hamas. Nancy Pelosi likewise denounced the speech in shameful terms. You know, 15 years ago, Israel had the strongest, most powerful lobby in this country. Now, it's almost the opposite, with AOC plus three and all the people, the enemies of our country in a true sense. But they are. And the enemies, when they saw all these people abandoned Israel, they took note. And I don't think it's accidental that just four days after Harris and Biden repudiated our Israeli allies, Iran's top terrorist group, Hezbollah, fired an Iranian missile to kill 12 innocent children at a soccer field in northern Israel. It happened right after he left. With great embarrassment, he left. The terrorists did it because they assumed they could get away with it because the United States is weak and ineffective and no longer respected. We are no longer respected. We are a failing nation. I mean, it's horrible. You don't want to say it. I wish I didn't have to say it. I wish I could say they're doing a phenomenal job. I wouldn't run. I wouldn't run. I wouldn't have to run. I would be very happy to have somebody do a phenomenal job. I wouldn't have to run, and I'd be very happy with that. I'd be proud of our country. But right now, our country is a joke. It's being laughed at all over the world. The truth is Harris' and Biden's weakness is inviting every rogue enemy worldwide to absolutely get away with murder. In my next term, we will build a great Iron Dome missile defense shield over our country, a dome like has never been seen before, and it will be entirely made in the USA and right here in Pennsylvania, big sections of it. And I will cut—remember this, I will cut all of the bad talk about Social Security. They're going to destroy your Social Security, but I will not cut one cent from Social Security or Medicare. And I kept my promise for four years, and I will keep it again. And seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security, and they won't—they won't. There are the people, it's up to you. No tax on Social Security. By contrast, Kamala cast a tie-breaking vote to cut Medicare, you saw this, by $237 billion in a heartless betrayal of American seniors. We're going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety, and beauty, better than they have ever been before. We will take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington, DC, clean it up, renovate it, fix it, rebuild it. We will again have the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world. And there will be no crime, no crime allowed, very strong. Right now, you go there, you get mugged, you get shot. On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the lives of our children. [cheers and applause] And I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate. [cheers and applause] And I will keep men out of women's sports. How simple is that? [cheers and applause] I will fully uphold our Second Amendment, as I did for four years. We just got the backing of the NRA, complete and total endorsement from the NRA. We will protect innocent life, and we will restore free speech to our country again. And very importantly, I will secure our elections. Our goal will be one-day voting with paper ballots, proof of citizenship, voter ID. We're going to do it. We're going to do it. [cheers and applause] A lot of other countries are doing it. The mail-in voting isn't working. It's corrupt. But until then, Republicans must win. We want to have a landslide because the best way to protect against the rigging, and these people know it, is too big to rig. There's a level at which they can't cheat. So, if you want to save America, get your friends, get your family, get everyone you know and vote, vote early, vote absentee, vote on Election Day. I don't care when you vote, but whatever you do, you have to vote and make sure your ballot counts because these people cheat. They cheat like dogs. And if you want to help us ensure election integrity, sign up at protectthevote.com, protectthevote.com. And in conclusion, from Easton to Hershey, from Jamestown to Allentown, and from Pittsburgh to right here in beautiful Harrisburg—we love Harrisburg. We got a lot of votes in Harrisburg. We stand on the shoulders of American legends who poured out their blood, sweat, and tears for our rights and for our freedom. Pennsylvania is where our founding fathers declared American independence. Think of that. Think of the history that this great, great place—it's beautiful. Pennsylvania, think of the history that you have. It's where the Army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge where General George Washington—we're never taking his name off any buildings. They'd like to. When they want to take Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson off, it ain't gonna happen. But it will happen under her. George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware and where the union was saved by the immortal heroes at Gettysburg. Gettysburg. Wow. [cheers and applause] Gettysburg. And this is the state where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania miners and steelworkers forged the greatest nation in the history of the world. But now, we are a nation in serious decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, lost its willpower, and lost its strength. We are a nation that has lost quite simply its way. But we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Less than four years ago, we were a great nation. And we will soon be a great nation again. [cheers and applause] Soon be. With our leadership, every disaster Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have created can be fixed and be quick—very quickly. We're going to do it so quickly. Remember, I used to tell the story, we're going to win, win, win, right? We're going to win so much; you're going to get tired of winning. We're going to win. We're going to start winning. ""Please, please, Mr. President, we're winning too much. We can't take it anymore."" We're going to win, win, win. Every problem can be solved and every wrong can be rectified. By this time next year, America's borders will be strong, sealed, and secure. Inflation will be a full thing of the past. It will be in full retreat. Our economy will be roaring back. Optimism will be surging. The American dream will be thriving again for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. Law and justice will reign all throughout our land. Freedom will be restored. The flame of liberty will be burning bright. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the worst administration in the history of our country, will be a fading memory of the past. And our great silent majority, including the once-forgotten men and women of our country, will be the ones shaping America's magnificent future when I am the 47th president of the United States because we are all Americans; and together, we will show November 5th to be the most important day in the history of our country. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America powerful again, make America wealthy again, make America strong again, make America proud again, make America safe again, make America free again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. [music: Sam & Dave, ""Hold On, I'm Coming""]",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373715",13067,"THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good evening, Texas. (Applause.) Can we please hear it for Sima? (Applause.) Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Please have a seat. Please have a seat. Sima, thank you for those kind words. You just hosted me in your home just a few months ago, and you've really been tireless in your support of me and, before this, of the president and me. And, in fact, I -- he and I had our regular lunch today, and so I bring you greetings from Joe Biden and thanks from him -- (applause) -- for all you have done here. Thank you all. I want to thank everyone who was a part of this. And, in particular, I want to also thank -- in addition to Sima -- Eartha, Lonnie, and the entire host committee for bringing us together. And thank you as well to all the extraordinary leaders who are here. We have Representative Al Green -- (applause); Representative Lizzie Fletcher -- (applause); Representative Sylvia Garcia -- (applause); Greg Casar, who was here with his mother -- was, still is, there -- there somewhere -- there you are -- (laughs) -- (applause); Judge Lina Hidalgo -- (applause); and my long-standing friend, Commissioner Rodney Ellis. (Applause.) And, of course, in front of all the friends here, I must thank our national finance chair, Chris Korge, for all that you do, Chris -- (applause) -- and have been doing. And to all of the leaders here, I thank you. And it is wonderful to be with you. So, last week, I visited an emergency operations center in Houston. I was just here last week. I was with, actually, the commissioner and the mayor. And I received a briefing from first responders on the recovery efforts after Hurricane Beryl. And I just want to make clear that our administration is making sure that this city has all the resources that you need to recover quickly and fully. (Applause.) And, of course, we must also tackle the climate crisis. And it -- we are seeing increasingly that it is fueling these kinds of disasters because of increasing extreme weather around our country. And so, we will stay committed to that as well. And with that -- so, as Sima said, we have 97 days to go -- (applause) -- 97 days until the election. And I know many of us have been involved in these elections every four years, and every four years, we say, ""This is the one."" (Laughter.) Well, this here is the one. (Applause.) This is the one. (Laughs.) This is the one. And as Sima said -- really, it is -- I mean, the most existential, consequential, and important election of our lifetimes. And in this election, I think it's so important that we remember, we are not fighting against something; we are fighting for something. It's very important to remember. We love our country. We are fighting for the best of who we are. This is a fight for the future of our nation and for our most fundamental freedoms and rights. And in this fight, borne out of love of country, we believe in the promise of America. So many of us are empirical evidence of the promise of America. Right? (Applause.) Right? And the promise of America includes a promise of freedom and opportunity and justice, not just for some but for all. And we know we are in this fight, then, because we know how much is at stake. As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, elected district attorney. And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.) So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all types -- (laughter): predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their personal gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.) In fact, I've been dealing with people like him my entire career. (Laughter.) For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students, including our veterans. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. (Laughter.) As a prosecutor, I specialized in sexual abuse cases. Well -- (laughter) -- Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. As an attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud -- 34 counts. (Applause.) So, in this campaign, I say to all the friends here: I proudly put my record against his any day of the week -- (applause) -- any day of the week. But, again, let us not make any mistake: This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It truly is about two very different visions for our nation -- one that is focused on the future and the other that is focused on the past. And I know the leaders who are in this room, and so I say what I know to be true. We here believe in a future, for example, with affordable health care, affordable childcare, paid family leave. We believe in a future where no child grows up in poverty, where every senior can retire with dignity, where all people have clean water to drink and clean air to breathe. We believe in a future -- (applause) -- that keeps America's economy the strongest in the world; where every person has the opportunity to build a business, to own a home, to build intergenerational wealth. (Applause.) These are the things we believe in. And we see, then, a future where we bring down the cost of living for hardworking Americans so that people have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead. And that is so much of what is fueling our campaign. And that is why, when I am president, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs; I will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits; I will take on corporate landlords and cap rent increases; and take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. (Applause.) And all of this is to say, building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. (Applause.) Because we here know, when America's middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.) But as we move forward -- as we move our nation forward, Donald Trump, as I said and as we know, intends to take our country backward. And as a prime example, just look at his Project 2025 agenda. Project 2025 is a plan to weaken the middle class. I invite those who might need some help sleeping to take a look at it -- (laughter) -- but it'll keep you awake when you do. It'll keep you awake when you do, because you will see in that and in the words and in the policies and in the background of Donald Trump, he intends to cut Social Security and Medicare; he intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations; and he intends to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back to a time when -- many of us remember -- when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember that? It wasn't very long ago. Remember what that meant for children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes? And, you know, America has tried these failed policies before. But we are not going back. We are not going back. Ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. You know, I've been traveling -- as Sima said, I've been traveling our country for the last three and a half years, but starting this year, I mean, I think, before last week, I'd taken over -- almost 80 trips just this year alone. And I will tell you, across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights -- (applause): the freedom to vote -- and we can look at this region of the country to have all those examples; the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to live -- (applause) -- without fear of bigotry and hate; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- (applause); the freedom to learn and acknowledge America's full history -- (applause); and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body -- (applause) -- and not have her government tell her what to do. And, by the way, just -- let's pause on that for a moment and think about this. Regardless of your gender, imagine that in this year of our Lord, 2024, one in three women of reproductive age lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Regardless of your gender, think about it from this perspective: that at this moment, our country -- and in our country, the highest court took one of the most basic freedoms that any individual could have, the freedom to make decisions about your own body -- not your property, not your busi- -- I mean, and that would be a problem too -- but your own body. Think about that. (Applause.) And if that freedom is being taken, what else could be on the line? That's where we are right now in our country. But here's the thing we know: Generations of Americans before us led in the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands -- each and every one of us. And so, we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks -- (applause) -- and red flag laws and an assault weapons ban. We who believe in reproductive freedom will fight for a woman's right to choose. (Applause.) And we remember that when he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court -- the court of Thurgood and RBG -- because he intended for them to overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. And now more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. And if he wins, I promise you he intends to pass a nationwide abortion ban to ban abortion in every state. But I will not let that happen. (Applause.) I will not let that happen. And when I am president and when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, I will sign it into law. (Applause.) In this moment, our fundamental freedoms are on the ballot -- our fundamental freedoms are on the ballot and so is our democracy -- so is our democracy. We cannot overlook what happened this month when the United States Supreme Court -- please remember and keep this in mind, because this election, this is not 2016 or 2020 in so many ways, including this. This month, the United States Supreme Court basically just told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud, that, going forward, he will be immune for activity we know he is prepared to engage in if he gets back in the White House. So, think about that. At least before, there was the threat that there might be consequence. Now there is implicit -- some would say explicit -- authority to know there will be no consequence. And pair that up with the fact Donald Trump has openly vowed, if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one, that he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies, that he will round up peaceful protesters and throw them out of our country, and even, quote, ""terminate"" the Constitution of the United States. So, let us be very clear: Someone who suggested he should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have the chance to stand behind a microphone -- (applause) -- and never again have the chance to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. (Applause.) Never again. This is serious business. So, ultimately, in this election, I think we all know, we each face a question and the question being: What kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law or a country of chaos, fear, and hate? And the beauty of our democracy -- because we intend to keep it -- the beauty of our democracy is that we each have the power to answer that question. We each have the power to answer that question. The power is with the people. So, November 5th is 97 days from now. And let's level set. We are the underdogs in this race. There is enthusiasm, Sima mentioned, historic numbers in terms of what we have done, grassroots fundraising, the numbers of volunteers that are coming in. We are the underdogs in this race. So, let's level set. We have a fight in front of us. And we have work to do -- hard work, good hard work. (Laughter.) And this is the thing: We like hard work. Hard work is good work. But this is not the time, then -- (applause) -- this is not the time, then -- as we all know, which is why we're here together, this is not our time to throw up our hands. This is our time to roll up our sleeves. And together, we will fight to build the nation that we love and that the people deserve. And we know that when we fight -- AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: -- we win! (Applause.) (Inaudible.) God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you all very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.","","",""

(Laughs.) (Applause.) Thank you. Everyone, can we please hear it for Tyler? (Applause.) I want to thank Tyler for that incredible introduction. I invited him and several other young entrepreneurs to come and visit with me at the White House, and we had a, really, very long and important conversation about the future of America. And, Tyler, you represent the best of our future. Thank you for that. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. And please give it up for Quavo — (applause) — and Megan. (Applause.) So, it is so good to see everyone. And let me — let me also thank our incredible members of Congress who are with us this evening: Senator Jon Ossoff — (applause); Senator Raphael Warnock — (applause); and Representative Nikema Williams — (applause).

And you all helped us win in 2020, and we going to do it again in 2024. (Applause.) Yes, we will. Yes, we will. AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, let's get right down — (laughs) — so — (applause) — so, I'm going to get i- — I'm — I'm going to get into some business now. Okay? (Laughter.) I'm going to get into some business now. All right. So, Georgia, as many of you know, before — and have a seat, if you have a chair. (Laughter.) As many of you know, before I was elected vice president and before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and an elected district attorney. (Applause.) And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. (Applause.) So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds — (applause): predators who abused women — (applause); fraudsters who ripped off consumers — (applause); cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain — (applause). So, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.) I know the type. And I have been dealing with people like him my entire career. For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: As a prosecutor, I specialized in child sexual abuse cases and sexual abuse cases. Well, Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: And as an attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud — (applause) — 34 counts. So, in this — AUDIENCE: Lock him up! THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, in this campaign — AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) (Inaudible.) So, in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week — (applause) — any day of the week, including, for example, on the issue of immigration. So, I was the attorney general of a border state. In that job, I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won. Donald Trump — (applause) — Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk — (applause) — or as my friend Quavo would say, he does not walk it like he talks it. (Applause.) Where's Quavo? (Laughs.) So, look, our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the bill. Even the Border Patrol endorsed it. It was all set to pass. But at the last minute, Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. He tanked — tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election — AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: — which goes to show Donald Trump does not care about border security; he only cares about himself. (Applause.) And when I am president, I will work to actually solve the problem. (Applause.) So, here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed, and I will sign it into law — (applause) — and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like. (Applause.) But make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. Truly, this campaign is about two very different visions for our nation — (applause): one focused on the future, the other focused on the past. (Applause.) We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity to build a business — (applause) — to own a home, to build intergenerational wealth — (applause); a future with affordable health care — (applause) — affordable childcare, paid leave. (Applause.) And all of this is to say: Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. (Applause.) Because we here all know, when our middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.) And to keep our middle class strong, families need relief from the high cost of living so that they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead. (Applause.) And, yes, it is true that by many indicators, our economy is the strongest in the world — (applause) — but while inflation is down and wages are up, prices are still too high. (Applause.) You know it, and I know it. (Applause.) And when we win this election, here's what we're going to do about it. On day one, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs. (Applause.) We will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits. (Applause.) We will take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases. (Applause.) And we will take on Big Pharma to cap prescription drug costs for all Americans. (Applause.) Our plan will lower costs and save many middle-class families thousands of dollars a year. But Donald Trump has a different plan in mind, one that would raise prices on middle-class families. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: I take it you've seen it. (Laughter.) Project 2025 is a plan to weaken the middle class, be clear. And Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to gut our investments in clean energy jobs. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to end the Affordable Care Act — AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: — to take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. Do you guys remember what that was? Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes. Georgia, America has tried these failed policies before, and we are not — AUDIENCE: Going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: — going back. (Applause.) We're not going back. We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.) Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote — (applause); the freedom to be safe from gun violence — (applause); the freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate — (applause); the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride — (applause); the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history — (applause); and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body — (applause) — and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.) Ours is a fight for the future and for freedom. And I don't have to tell folks in Atlanta that generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands — (applause) — each and every one of us. And we love our country. We love our country. And I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. (Applause.) And so, we, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, will finally pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. (Applause.) We, who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence, will finally pass universal background checks — (applause), red flag laws — (applause), and an assault weapons ban — (applause). We, who believe in reproductive freedom — (applause) — will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans. And when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms — (applause) — as president of the United States, I will sign it into law. (Applause.) So, November 5th — November 5th is in 98 days. (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: An- — (Laughs.) (Applause.) So, in 98 days — and let's level set. Friends, let's level set. We have a fight in front of us. (Applause.) We have a fight in front of us, and we are the underdogs in this race. We are. But you see, this is a people-powered campaign. (Applause.) Ours is a people-powered campaign. In fact, after I announced my candidacy, we saw the best week of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history. (Applause.) And if you go to KamalaHarris.com, you can help us build on that success. (Applause.) So, the momentum in this race is shifting. And there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it. (Laughter and applause.) You may have noticed. So, last week, you may have seen, he pulled out of the debate in September he had previously agreed to. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: So — so, here's the thing. Here- — here's the funny thing about that. Here's the funny thing about that. So, he won't debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me. (Applause.) And, by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird? (Applause.) Well, Donald — (applause) — I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage — (applause) — because, as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face. (Laughs.) (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So, Georgia, in the next 98 days, we have our work cut out for us. And this is not going to be easy. This is hard work, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.) So, Georgia, today I ask you: Are you ready to get to work? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in freedom? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in opportunity? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in the promise of America? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: And are we ready to fight for it? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: And when we fight — AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win! God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)","","",""

(Applause.) And I also thank my dear friend, former Governor Deval Patrick -- (applause) -- and former first lady Diane Patrick -- (applause) -- and the entire host committee for welcoming us today. Thank you all. So, I will begin by saying a bit -- although I could talk all afternoon -- about our incredible president, Joe Biden. (Applause.) So, it has truly been one of the greatest honors of my life and career to serve as vice president to Joe Biden. His legacy of acco- -- and James and I were just talking about this -- his legacy of accomplishment over his entire career and over the past three and a half years is unmatched in modern history. In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office. And as he said in his Oval Office address earlier this week, in the next six months, he will continue to fight for the American people. (Applause.) And I know we are all deeply, deeply grateful for his continued service to our nation. (Applause.) And it is also my great honor to have Joe Biden's endorsement in this race. (Laughs.) (Applause.) And many of you may know, already, we have earned the support of enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination. (Applause.) I thank you for the help. (Laughs.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all. (Applause.) And I pledge to you that in the coming weeks, I will continue to work so very hard to do what we must do to unite our party on the path to uniting our country. And so, let me just say a few things about my background. Many of you may know, before I was elected vice president of the United States, I was a United States senator. And before then, I was elected attorney general of California. And before that, district attorney of San Francisco. And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. All that to say -- (laughter and applause) -- in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds -- (laughter and applause) -- predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type. (Laughter and applause.) In fact, I have been dealing with people like him my entire career. (Laughter.) For example, as attorney general, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. As a prosecutor, I specialized in sexual abuse cases. Well, Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. As attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud -- 34 counts. So, in this campaign -- and I say in all seriousness -- I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week. (Applause.) Any day of the week. But let us -- let us make no mistake. This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. Our campaign has always been about two very different visions for our nation. One, ours, that is focused on the future, and the other that is focused almost entirely on the past. We believe in a future that keeps America's economy the strongest in the world; a future that promotes both economic growth and economic fairness, where every person has the opportunity to compete, thrive, and prosper -- to build a business, to own a home, and to build generational wealth; where we, in the future, bring down cost for hardworking Americans so they can afford to pay their bills and still have something left over, so they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead; a future where every worker has the freedom to join a union -- (applause) -- where no child has to grow up in poverty -- (applause) -- and where every senior can retire with dignity -- (applause); a future with affordable health care, affordable childcare, and paid leave. (Applause.) All of this is to say that building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. Because we know -- (applause) -- when America's middle class is strong, America is strong. (Applause.) But as we fight to move our nation forward, Donald Trump intends to take our country backward. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda. A- -- and, by the way, can you believe they put that thing in writing? (Laughter.) Nine hundred pages of it. (Laughter.) So, Project 2025 is a plan that would return America to a very dark past -- and weaken the middle class, by the way. Independent economists have said Trump's plans would reignite inflation, slow economic growth, and increase unemployment. Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and make working families foot the bill. He intends to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. You guys remember what that was? It was real. Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes. And America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back. We are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. We are not going back. (Applause.) And, you know, there's been this, I think, quite perverse thing that has been happening over the last several years, which is that some folks would suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down -- you know that -- have you noticed? -- right? -- that somehow you're strong if you're a bully? -- instead of what we all know: The true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up -- who you lift up. (Applause.) That's the strength of a leader. And so, to the friends here, I say, it is we who are working to lift up the people of America. We're clear about this. You know, and when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. We are clear, it is we who are intent on lifting up the people of our nation. And ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom, and now the baton is in our hands. It's in our hands. We, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) We -- we, who believe that every person in our nation should have the freedom to live safe from the terror of gun violence, will finally pass universal background checks -- (applause) -- red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban. (Applause.) And we, who believe in reproductive freedom, will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans -- (applause) -- because we trust women to make decisions about their own bodies and not have their government telling them what to do. (Applause.) And -- I'm just going off script for a second. So, here's the thing -- (laughter) -- Think about it. You know, there's so much about what we have prided ourselves in about our country in terms of progress, understanding that one of the defining components of that progress is the expansion of rights. And we are seeing a full-on agenda that is now about restricting rights -- and one of the most fundamental rights, the right to make decisions about your own body. Think about that. And if there are those who dare to take the freedom to make such a fundamental decision for an individual, which is about one's own body, what other freedoms could be on the table for the taking? (Applause.) This is serious business -- serious business. And I pledge to you, when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will sign it into law. (Applause.) So, to everyone here and all the friends I say, you know, ultimately, in this election, I do believe that each one of us faces a question. That question being, what kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear, and hate? And the beauty of our democracy is that each one of us has the power to answer that question. And the power then, I say, is with the people. The power is with the people. So, in 101 days, which is November 5th -- (laughter) -- let us be clear-eyed: We have a fight ahead of us. We got a fight ahead of us. And we are the underdogs in this race. Okay? Level set. We're the underdogs in this race. But this is a people-powered campaign, and we have momentum. The day after I announced my candidacy, we saw the best 24 hours of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history. (Applause.) And since then -- and since then, in battleground states, people have been flooding our offices around the country to volunteer. So -- (applause) -- this is good. We've got momentum. It's on our side. And you may have noticed Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record. And some of what he and his running mate are saying, it's just plain weird. (Laughter.) I mean, that's the box you put that in, right? (Laughter and applause.) And you may have seen he just pulled out of our debate. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE VICE PRESIDENT: Mm-hmm. Right? I hope he reconsiders. I hope he reconsiders. Because we have a lot to talk about. (Laughter and applause.) Yep. But the bottom line is we have our work cut out for us. Okay? We have our work cut out for us. And this is not going to be easy. But I know something about the folks in this room. We can do hard things. And we like hard work. That's good work. And on that point, I will say, it is because of that I will tell you what I sincerely and deeply know and believe: We are going to win. (Applause.) We are going to win. So, today I ask, are you ready to get to work? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in freedom? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in opportunity? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: Do we believe in the promise of America? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: And are we ready to fight for it? AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: And when we fight, we win. (Applause.) God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you all. Thank you.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373626",10527,"THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. (Applause.) Good after- — hi, Wisconsin. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you all. (Applause.) Thank you. Tha- — (laughs) — thank you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you all. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Tha- — good afternoon, Wisconsin! (Laughs.) (Applause.) Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you. It is good to be back. Thank you all very much. (Applause.) Can we please hear it for Leia and her extraordinary story and leadership? (Applause.) Thank you. And I do believe our teachers do God's work. They teach other people's children, and God knows we don't pay them enough. Let's thank her. (Applause.) And it is so good to be here and be back with so many extraordinary leaders, including my friend, the great governor of Wisconsin, Tony Evers. (Applause.) He's here somewhere. My dear friend, Senator Tammy Baldwin. (Applause.) And, you know, I had the privilege of serving with Tammy when I was in the United States Senate, and she is always fighting for the people of this state. And I know that the folks that are here are going to make sure you return her to Washington, D.C., in November. (Applause.) Yes, we are going to elect her back to Washington, D.C. It is so good to be here also with Lieutenant Governor Sara Rodriguez — (applause); Attorney General Josh Kaul — (applause); Wisconsin Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski — (applause); County Executive David — David Crowley — (applause); Mayor Cavalier Johnson — (applause); and the great state party chair, Ben Wikler — (applause) — who I have worked with — Ben, you and I have been working together for years. And I can attest, he knows how to build the infrastructure that delivers wins up and down the ballot. Thank you, Ben. (Applause.) So, it is good to be back in Wisconsin, and it is great to be in Milwaukee. (Applause.) As many of you know, our state campaign headquarters are in this city. (Applause.) Yes. And th- — there's a reason for that: The path to the White House goes through Wisconsin. (Applause.) Yes, it does. And to win in Wisconsin, we are counting on you, right here in Milwaukee. (Applause.) And you all helped us win in 2020. (Applause.) And in 2024, we will win again. (Applause.) Yes, we will. So, Milwaukee, I want to start by saying a few words — and I could really speak at length — but a few words about our incredible president, Joe Biden. (Applause.) It has truly been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve as vice president to our president, Joe Biden. (Applause.) Joe's legacy of accomplishment over his entire career and over the past three and a half years is unmatched in modern history. (Applause.) In one term — think about it. In one term as president, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who served two terms in office. (Applause.) And I know we are all deeply, deeply grateful for his continuing service to our nation. (Applause.) And it is my great honor to have Joe Biden's endorsement in this race. (Applause.) So — so, Wisconsin, I am told, as of this morning, that we have earned the support of enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination. (Applause.) And I am so very honored. And I pledge to you I will spend the coming weeks continuing to unite our party so that we are ready to win in November. (Applause.) So, friends, we have 105 days until Election Day. And in that time, we've got some work to do. But we're not afraid of hard work. We like hard work, don't we? (Applause.) And we will win this election. (Applause.) Yes, we will. So, as Leia told you, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected a United States senator, I was elected attorney general of the state of California. And I was a courtroom prosecutor before then. (Applause.) And in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds — (laughter) — predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type. (Applause.) (Laughs.) AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And in this campaign, I promise you I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week. (Applause.) As attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students. Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse. Well, Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: As attorney general of California, I took on the big Wall Street banks and held them accountable for fraud. (Applause.) Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud on 34 counts. (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: Lock him up! THE VICE PRESIDENT: But let's also make no mistake: This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. This campaign is about who we fight for. (Applause.) This is about who we fight for. Just look at how we are running our campaigns. So, Donald Trump is relying on support from billionaires and big corporations, and he is trading access in exchange for campaign contributions. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: A couple of months ago — y'all saw that? — a couple months ago at Mar-a-Lago, he literally promised Big Oil companies — Big Oil lobbyists he would do their bidding for $1 billion in campaign donations. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: On the other hand, we are running a people-powered campaign. (Applause.) And we just had — some breaking news: We just had the best 24 hours — (applause) — of grassroot fundraising in presidential campaign history. (Applause.) All right? And because we are a people-powered campaign, that is how you know we will be a people-first presidency. (Applause.) And, Wisconsin, this campaign is also about two different visions for our nation: one where we are focused on the future, the other focused on the past. We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead — (applause); a future where no child has to grow up in poverty — (applause); where every worker has the freedom to join a union — (applause); where every person has affordable health care — (applause) — affordable childcare — (applause) — and paid family leave. (Applause.) We believe in a future where every senior can retire with dignity. (Applause.) So, all of this is to say: Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. (Applause.) Because here's the thing we all here, Wisconsin, know: When our middle class is strong, American is strong. (Applause.) But Donald Trump wants to take our country backward. He and his extreme Project 2025 agenda — AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: — will weaken the middle class. Like, we know we got to take this seriously. And can you believe they put that thing in writing? (Laughter.) Read it. It's 900 pages. But here's the thing: You — when you read it, you will see Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and make working families foot the bill. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: They intend to end the Affordable Care Act — AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: — and take us back, then, to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. AUDIENCE: Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT: Remember what that was like? AUDIENCE: Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT: Children with asthma, women who survived breast cancer, grandparents with diabetes. America has tried these failed economic policies before, but we are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back. We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. AUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. And I'll tell you why we're not going back: because ours is a fight for the future. (Applause.) And it is a fight for freedom. (Applause.) Generations of Americas b- — generations — and we have to remember this: the shoulders on which we stand. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now, Wisconsin, the baton is in our hands. (Applause.) We who believe in the sacred freedom to vote — (applause) — will make sure every American has the ability to cast their ballot and have it counted. (Applause.) We who believe that every person in our nation sh- — who should have the freedom to live safe from the terror of gun violence — (applause) — will finally pass red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban. (Applause.) And we who believe in reproductive freedom — (applause) — will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do. (Applause.) And when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will sign it into law. (Applause.) So, Wisconsin, ultimately, in this election, we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in? AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: A country — (laughter and applause). And to your point — (laughter) — do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law — (applause) — or a country of chaos, fear, and hate? AUDIENCE: No! THE VICE PRESIDENT: And here's the beauty of this moment: We each have the power to answer that question. The power is with the people. (Applause.) We each have the power to answer that question. And in the next 105 days, then, we have work to do. (Applause.) We have doors to knock on, we have phone calls to make, we have voters to register, and we have an election to win. (Applause.) So, Wisconsin, today I ask you: Are you ready to get to work? (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom? (Applause.) Do we believe in opportunity? (Applause.) Do we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.) And are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.) And when we fight — AUDIENCE: We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.

Julie, if I didn't have COVID, I'd be sitting there with you—standing there with you. And I'm so proud of what you've all done. I mean, but this COVID has been keeping me out of people's hair for the next 3 or 4 days. But I'm going to be on the road, and I'm not going anywhere. I'm going—it's going—it's kept me away a little bit, but you know, I want people to remember that what we have done has been incredible, and we get—so much more we're going to get done. And so I want to say hello to Kamala if she can hear me. I know she's going to be speaking shortly. And I want to say to the team: Embrace her. She's the best. I wanted to call today to thank everybody—[applause]—everybody in this effort. I know yesterday's news is surprising and it's hard for you to hear, but it was the right thing to do. It's—I know it's hard because you've poured your heart and soul into me to help us win this thing, help me get this nomination, help me win the nomination and then go on to win the Presidency. But you know, you're an amazing team. But we've got a great, great—I think we made the right decision. I know how hard you've worked, how many sacrifices you've made. And so many of you—so many of you—uprooted your lives for me and the kind of commitment few people make for anything these days, but you made it. And I've been honored and humbled. I mean this from the bottom of my heart—my word as a Biden—that for all you've done for me and my family. And you—we built the best campaign and organization in history. I've been doing this—I kid—I always kid and say, I know I'm only 40, but—[laughter]—I've been around a long time. I don't know of a better campaign organization, grassroots campaign. You know, we have over 230 offices opened, we have over 2,000 paid staff, and we have literally several thousand volunteers on a regular basis—thousands of them. And they've been relentless and tireless in reaching out and contacting voters. The leadership of this campaign has been amazing: Jen O'Malley Dillon, Julie, Quentin, Michael Tyler, Rob Flaherty, Rufus on raising money, and so many more. You built this team, you brought them together—you brought us together, you've inspired them, and you've done what leaders do. Now—and we've got to—you know, the name has changed at the top of the ticket, but the mission hasn't changed at all. [Applause] And by the way, I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to be out there on the campaign with her, with Kamala. I'm going to be working like hell both as a sitting President, getting legislation passed, as well as in campaigning. You know, what—we still need to save this democracy. And Trump is still a danger to the community, he's a danger to the Nation. And just ask my foreign policy colleagues, my counterparts, and other people around the world and at home. Look, so I'm hoping you'll give every bit of your heart and soul that you gave to me to Kamala. And I want you to know: I won't be on the ticket, but I'm still going to be fully, fully engaged. I've got 6 months left of my Presidency, and I'm determined to get as much done as I possibly can, both foreign policy and domestic policy; keep lowering costs for families; continue to speak out on guns and childcare, eldercare, prescription drugs, and climate. Climate still is the existential threat that we face, and we have—if we don't—if we don't win this thing, it's all in jeopardy. And we've got to keep working for an end to the war in Gaza. I'll be working very closely with the Israelis and with the Palestinians to try to work out how we can get the Gaza war to end and the Middle East peace and get all those hostages home. I think we're on a verge of being able to do that. And we've got to keep our alliances together. It's critically important. It took a while for me to build these alliances. Most of these are—my colleagues have acknowledged that. But it's critically, critically important for our safety and security. And I know I'll be doing whatever Kamala wants me or needs me to do in addition. So let me be real clear. We're still fighting in this fight together. I'm not going anywhere. And I want you to know I've always—you've always had my back, and I promise you I will always have your back. And I'm anxious to—for you all to hear from Kamala. So thank you, thank you, thank you. Julie, you're the best. 2024 Kamala Harris for President Campaign Manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez. Well, thank you so much, Mr. President. The President. Thank you. I'm sticking around. I'm going to listen. Ms. Chávez Rodríguez. All right. Thank you so much, Mr. President, again, for taking time to join our call today. And you know, as the President said, we are full steam ahead in supporting the Vice President, and we are seeing incredible enthusiasm already from our supporters. From Democratic Governors to Senators to House Members to mayors to folks across the country, you know, our Democratic Party is really uniting around our nominee. And we just announced that we raised $81 million in 24 hours. So now I am incredibly honored to bring up the Second Gentleman to be able to mark a historic day with us today. With that, I'd like to introduce Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff. Audience members. Doug! Doug! Doug! Second Gentleman Douglas C. Emhoff. Woo! Wow. Julie, thank you so much. I've known Julie a long, long time, going back to her days working in Kamala's Senate office. And we've put a lot of time together out on the road on the last campaign, and I can't think of anyone better to be leading this campaign. So thank you so much. You're the best. I was just very emotional listening to President Biden just then. I was emotional before I heard that because of who he is and what he represents: the dignity, the empathy. He's had my back personally. Some of my toughest moments as Second Gentleman. One, leaving the career that I loved, it was always the President who came up to me and said: ""Look, I know—I know, kid. You're a great lawyer. I know this must have been tough."" [Laughter] ""But what better way to leave that than to support your wife, who you love so much, and your country that you love so much."" And it's hard to believe it was about 4 years ago—the first time I came to Wilmington is when she got the call from President—then-candidate Biden to be on the ticket. And we came here the next day. We went to their home. And he said, with Dr. Biden: ""Welcome to the family. You're now Bidens."" And they made us cookies. And they called our kids. And they called my parents. This was day one 4 years ago. And now look where we are now. To have been able to serve as Second Gentleman with him as our President, Dr. Biden as our First Lady—unbelievable. And now—now—I get to support my wife, Kamala Harris, running for President of the United States. And let me tell you something: We are going to win this election. We're on the right side of every single issue, and we have this team right here and thousands of others all around the country. How do I know? Because I've been traveling all around the country—[laughter]—and I've met them. We have an amazing team, you have done an amazing job, and you're going to continue to do that so we can elect Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States of America. So let's hear it for Kamala Harris. Thank you. Vice President Kamala D. Harris. The first Second Gentleman of the United States. Hi, everybody—hey, Delaware. [Laughter] Audience members. Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! Vice President Harris. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. Can we just give it up again for my husband? [Laughter] It is so good to hear our President's voice. Joe, I know you're still on the call. And we've been talking every day. You probably—you guys heard it from Doug's voice. We love Joe and Jill. We really do. They truly are like family to us. Audience member. So do we. Vice President Harris. And we do—everybody here does. Everybody—— The President. It's mutual. [Laughter] Vice President Harris. I knew you were still there. You're not going anywhere, Joe. The President. I'm watching you, kid. I'm watching you, kid. [Laughter] I love you. Vice President Harris. I love you, Joe. [Applause] Oh. So, Joe, I'm going to recognize some of the electeds who are here, and then I'm going to get back to you. Hold on a second. [Laughter] So let me do, please, acknowledge some extraordinary national leaders who are also dear friends both to the President and to me. Governor John Carney, where are you? There you are. And his wife, they are here. Senator Tom Carper, my former colleague, and his wife is here. Chris Coons, my dear friend. Attorney General Kathy Jennings. The mayor is here. Purzycki, where are you? [Applause] There. And the next United States Senator from the great State of Delaware is here, Lisa Blunt Rochester. And I know everyone here has seen these elected leaders in this very campaign office on a regular basis. And I know Joe is so thankful to them for their lifelong friendship, but I want to thank them also because you guys have really been carrying some heavy water from the first days of our campaign. So thank you all. This truly is a Delaware family. Thank you. I want to thank Jen O'Malley Dillon. Where is she, Jen? Jen—I'm going to talk about her in a minute. Julie Chávez Rodríguez; Sheila Nix—there you are; and the entire team that is here. I want to thank all of you and those who are joining from offices across our Nation. So Doug and I wanted to stop by today to thank everybody and to express just what we know to be true: You all have been working so hard. The people in this office have been working so hard. And you have given so much of yourselves: long days and nights, what you are sacrificing in terms of the time you could be spending with other friends and other family—[laughter]—and you're giving yourselves to our country because you love our country and you love Joe and you love me, and we know that. And so today, just right after Joe made his announcement, it was important for me to continue with his role of leadership in this office of, like him, who has said for many, many, many months, and I say it today: Thank you all so very much for what you are doing and what you will continue to do. [Applause] So let's applaud the team here. And I know it's been a roller coaster, and we're all filled with so many mixed emotions about this. I just have to say, I love Joe Biden. I love Joe Biden, and I know we all do. And we have so many darn good reasons for loving Joe Biden. [Laughter] And I have full faith that this team is—the team will be the reason we win in November, you all who are here. And as Julie always says, and I will quote the great Julie, ""We are one team, one fight""—[applause]—""one team, one fight."" And she's been an extraordinary campaign manager. She's going to continue in this role and see us to victory in November. And we are all here because we love our country, right? And we believe in our foundational principles. We believe in freedom and opportunity and justice, not for some, but for all. And so we have 106 days until election day, and in that time, we have some hard work to do. And as J.O.D. always reminds us, we can do hard things. J.O.D. has been such an incredible leader of this team, and that is why I have just asked her to run my campaign, and she has accepted. And so, over the next 106 days, we are going to take our case to the American people, and we are going to win. We are going to win. And so I'm—now I'm getting back to you, Joe. I will tell you all, it has been one of the greatest honors of my life, truly, to serve as Vice President to our President, Joe Biden. Joe's legacy of accomplishment just over—a lifetime, but just over the last 3½ years is unmatched in modern history. In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most Presidents who served two terms in office. Think about it. And I know everyone here in the campaign, we have—we know—[laughter]—but—if we don't know, we've got a problem. [Laughter] But I'm going to repeat some for those who might be guests at the moment. [Laughter] Joe got the COVID-19 pandemic under control. Remember those days? He has created more than 15 million new jobs. He brought together Republicans and Democrats and passed historic legislation. And I'm going to tell you, I'm a firsthand witness to all this work. I would sit with Joe in the Oval Office while he would bring Members of both sides to—of the aisle and talk and listen and help them see what they may have in common and how we can actually work towards solutions. And because of their confidence in Joe, these accomplishments occurred. Joe has stood up for democracy at home, and he has stood up for democracy abroad, and he has always stood up for what he believes is right. And many of you may know I first came to know Joe through his son Beau. Beau and I worked together as State attorneys general. And back then, Beau would often tell me stories about his dad, and he would talk about the kind of father and the kind of man that Joe Biden is. And he would talk about the qualities of his father. And the qualities that Beau revered the most are the same qualities that I see every day in our President: his honesty; his integrity; his commitment to his faith and his family; his big, big heart; and his deep love of our country. And I don't need to tell you all. You know Joe's background, right? I mean, he grew up in a middle class family in Scranton. And he has never forgotten where he comes from. And so, again, I am a firsthand witness from being with him in the Oval Office to the Situation Room and seeing him on the global stage with world leaders. President Joe Biden fights for the American people, and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our Nation. Joe, are you watching? Do you hear this clapping? [Laughter] Can you see it? The President. I'm watching. [Laughter] I'm watching. Vice President Harris. I knew it. Audience member. Thank you, Joe! Audience member. We love you, Joe! The President. You're the best, kid. Vice President Harris. And let us be very clear, Joe is not done, far from it. He knows there is still more work to do, and our Nation will continue to praise his bold and visionary leadership as President. Thank you, Joe. The President. Thank you. Vice President Harris. And it is my great honor to have Joe's endorsement in this race. The President. You sure do. Vice President Harris. And it is my intention to go out and earn this nomination and to win. So, in the days and weeks ahead, I, together with you, will do everything in my power to unite our Democratic Party, to unite our Nation, and to win this election. You know, as many of you know, before I was elected as Vice President, before I was elected as United States Senator, I was the elected attorney general, as I've mentioned, of California. And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds—[laughter]. Audience member. Go on! [Laughter] Vice President Harris. Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type. And in this campaign, I will proudly—I will proudly—put my record against his. As a young prosecutor, when I was in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office in California, I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse. Donald Trump was found liable by a jury for committing sexual abuse. As attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges and put it out of business. Donald Trump ran a for-profit college, Trump University, that was forced to pay $25 million to the students it scammed. As district attorney, to go after polluters, I created one of the first environmental justice units in our Nation. Donald Trump stood in Mar-a-Lago and told Big Oil lobbyists he would do their bidding for a $1 billion campaign contribution. Audience members. Boo! Audience member. Cheater. Vice President Harris. During—[laughter]. During the foreclosure crisis, I took on the big Wall Street banks and won $20 billion for California families, holding those banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of 34 counts of fraud. Audience members. Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Vice President Harris. But make no mistake, all of that being said, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. There is more to this campaign than that. Our campaign has always been about two different versions of what we see as the future of our country—two different visions for the future of our country: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past. Donald Trump wants to take our country backward to a time before many of our fellow Americans had full freedoms and rights. But we believe in a brighter future that makes room for all Americans. We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. We believe in a future where no child has to grow up in poverty; where every person can buy a home, start a family, and build wealth; and where every person has access to paid family leave and affordable childcare. [Applause] That's the future we see. Together, we fight to build a nation where every person has affordable health care, where every worker is paid fairly, and where every senior can retire with dignity. All of this is to say building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my Presidency. Because we here know, when our middle class is strong, America is strong. And we know that's not the future Donald Trump is fighting for. He and his—— Audience member. [Inaudible] [Laughter] Vice President Harris. He and his extreme Project 2025 will weaken the middle class and bring us backward—please do note that—back to the failed trickle-down policies that gave huge tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and made working families pay the cost; back to policies that put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block; back to policies that treat health care as only a privilege for the wealthy, instead of what we all know it should be, which is a right for every American. America has tried these economic policies before. They do not lead to prosperity. They lead to inequity and economic injustice, and we are not going back. We are not going back. They're not taking us back. Our fight for the future is also a fight for freedom. Generations of Americans before us have led the fight for freedom, from our Founders to our Framers, to the abolitionists and the suffragettes, to the Freedom Riders and farmworkers. And now I say, team, the baton is in our hands. We who believe in the sacred freedom to vote. We who are committed to fight to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom To Vote Act. We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence, and that's why we will work to pass universal background checks, ""red flag"" laws, and an assault weapons ban. We who will fight for reproductive freedom, knowing if Trump gets the chance, he will sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every single State. But we are not going to let that happen. It is this team here that is going to help in this November to elect a majority of Members of the United States Congress who agree the government should not be telling a woman what to do with her body. And when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as President of the United States, I will sign it into law. Audience member. We the people! Vice President Harris. Indeed. [Laughter] We the people. So, ultimately, to all the friends here, I say: In this election, we know we each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in: a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law—— Audience member. Yes! [Laughter] Vice President Harris. ——or a country of chaos, fear, and hate? Audience members. No! Vice President Harris. You all are here because you, as leaders, know we each—including our neighbors and our friends and our family, we each, as Americans, have the power to answer that question. That's the beauty of it—the power of the people. We each have the ability to answer that question. So, in the next 106 days, we have work to do. We have doors to knock on. We have people to talk to, we have phone calls to make, and we have an election to win. So are you ready to get to work? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we willing to fight for it? Audience members. Yes! Vice President Harris. And when we fight—— Audience members. We win! Vice President Harris. ——we win. God bless you all, and God bless the United States of America and Joe Biden.","","",""

July 21, 2024 My Fellow Americans, Over the past three and a half years, we have made great progress as a Nation. Today, America has the strongest economy in the world. We've made historic investments in rebuilding our Nation, in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, and in expanding affordable health care to a record number of Americans. We've provided critically needed care to a million veterans exposed to toxic substances. Passed the first gun safety law in 30 years. Appointed the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. And passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world. America has never been better positioned to lead than we are today. I know none of this could have been done without you, the American people. Together, we overcame a once in a century pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We've protected and preserved our Democracy. And we've revitalized and strengthened our alliances around the world. It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term. I will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision. For now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected. I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me. I believe today what I always have: that there is nothing America can't do - when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.","","",""

Thank you, Kid Rock, sometimes referred to as ""Bob."" And thank you, Lee, right from the beginning, thank you very much. What a talent. What a beautiful, beautiful song. Thank you. Friends, delegates and fellow citizens. I stand before you this evening with a message of confidence, strength and hope. Four months from now, we will have an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart. I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America. So tonight, with faith and devotion, I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United States. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And we will do it right. We're going to do it right. Let me begin this evening by expressing my gratitude to the American people for your outpouring of love and support following the assassination attempt at my rally on Saturday. As you already know, the assassin's bullet came within a quarter of an inch of taking my life. So many people have asked me what happened. ""Tell us what happened, please."" And therefore, I will tell you exactly what happened, and you'll never hear it from me a second time, because it's actually too painful to tell. It was a warm, beautiful day in the early evening in Butler Township in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Music was loudly playing, and the campaign was doing really well. I went to the stage and the crowd was cheering wildly. Everybody was happy. I began speaking very strongly, powerfully and happily. Because I was discussing the great job my administration did on immigration at the southern border. We were very proud of it. Behind me, and to the right, was a large screen that was displaying a chart of border crossings under my leadership. The numbers were absolutely amazing. In order to see the chart, I started to, like this, turn to my right, and was ready to begin a little bit further turn, which I'm very lucky I didn't do, when I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard. On my right ear. I said to myself, ""Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet."" And moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down. My hand was covered with blood. Just absolutely blood all over the place. I immediately knew it was very serious. That we were under attack. And in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground. Bullets were continuing to fly as very brave Secret Service agents rushed to the stage. And they really did. They rushed to the stage. These are great people at great risk, I will tell you, and pounced on top of me so that I would be protected. There was blood pouring everywhere, and yet in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side. I felt that. The amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassin's bullet would have perfectly hit its mark and I would not be here tonight. We would not be together. The most incredible aspect of what took place on that terrible evening, in the fading sun, was actually seen later. In almost all cases, as you probably know. And when even a single bullet is fired, just a single bullet, and we had many bullets that were being fired, crowds run for the exits or stampede. But not in this case. It was very unusual. This massive crowd of tens of thousands of people stood by and didn't move an inch. In fact, many of them bravely but automatically stood up, looking for where the sniper would be. They knew immediately that it was a sniper. And then began pointing at him. You can see that if you look at the group behind me. That was just a small group compared to what was in front. Nobody ran and, by not stampeding, many lives were saved. But that isn't the reason that they didn't move. The reason is that they knew I was in very serious trouble. They saw it. They saw me go down. They saw the blood, and thought, actually most did, that I was dead. They knew it was a shot to the head. They saw the blood. And there's an interesting statistic. The ears are the bloodiest part. If something happens with the ears they bleed more than any other part of the body. For whatever reason the doctors told me that. And I said, ""Why is there so much blood?"" He said, ""It's the ears, they bleed more."" So we learned something. But they just — They just, this beautiful crowd, they didn't want to leave me. They knew I was in trouble. They didn't want to leave me. And you can see that love written all over their faces. True. Incredible people. They're incredible people. Bullets were flying over us, yet I felt serene. But now the Secret Service agents were putting themselves in peril. They were in very dangerous territory. Bullets were flying right over them, missing them by a very small amount of inches. And then it all stopped. Our Secret Service sniper, from a much greater distance and with only one bullet used, took the assassin's life. Took him out. I'm not supposed to be here tonight. Not supposed to be here. [Crowd chants ""Yes, you are.""] Thank you. But I'm not. And I'll tell you. I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God. And watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a providential moment. Probably was. When I rose, surrounded by Secret Service, the crowd was confused because they thought I was dead. And there was great, great sorrow. I could see that on their faces as I looked out. They didn't know I was looking out; they thought it was over. But I could see it and I wanted to do something to let them know I was OK. I raised my right arm, looked at the thousands and thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting and started shouting, ""Fight, fight, fight."" Thank you. Once my clenched fist went up, and it was high into the air, you've all seen that, the crowd realized I was OK and roared with pride for our country like no crowd I have ever heard before. Never heard anything like it. For the rest of my life, I will be grateful for the love shown by that giant audience of patriots that stood bravely on that fateful evening in Pennsylvania. Tragically, the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans: Corey Comperatore. Unbelievable person, everybody tells me. Unbelievable. And seriously wounded two other great warriors. Spoke to them today: David Dutch and James Copenhaver. Two great people. I also spoke to all three families of these tremendous people. Our love and prayers are with them and always will be. We're never going to forget them. They came for a great rally. They were serious Trumpsters, I want to tell you. They were serious Trumpsters and still are. But Corey, unfortunately, we have to use the past tense. He was incredible. Yeah. He was a highly respected former fire chief. Respected by everybody. Was accompanied by his wife, Helen. Incredible woman. I spoke to her today. Devastated. And two precious daughters. He lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect them from flying bullets. He went right over the top of them and was hit. What a fine man he was. I want to thank the fire department and the family for sending his helmet, his outfit and it was just something, and they're going to do something very special when they get it. But we did something which cannot match what happened. Not even close. But I am very proud to say that over the past few days we've raised $6.3 million. For the families of David, James and Corey. Including from a friend of mine just — called up, he sent me a check, right here, just got it. One million dollars. From Dan Newlin, thank you, Dan. And again, when speaking to the family, I told them, I said, ""Well, I'm going to be sending a lot of money, but it can't compensate."" They all said the same thing: ""You're right, sir; we appreciate so much what you're doing, but nothing can take the place, in the case of Corey."" And the other two. By the way, they were very, very seriously injured. But now they're doing very well. They're going to be OK. They're going to be doing very well. They're warriors. So now, I ask that we observe a moment of silence in honor of our friend Corey. There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for others. This is the spirit that forged America in her darkest hours. And this is the love that will lead America back to the summit of human achievement and greatness. This what we need. Despite such a heinous attack, we unite this evening, more determined than ever. I am more determined than ever and so are you. So is everybody in this room. [Crowd chants, ""We love Trump.""] Thank you. Thank you very much. Our resolve is unbroken and our purpose is unchanged, to deliver a government that serves the American people better than ever before. Nothing will stop me in this mission, because our vision is righteous and our cause is pure. No matter what obstacle comes our way, we will not break. We will not bend. We will not back down and I will never stop fighting for you, your family and our magnificent country. Never. And everything I have to give with all of the energy and fight in my heart and soul, I pledge to our nation tonight. Thank you very much. I pledge that to our nation. We're going to turn our nation around and we're going to do it very quickly. Thank you. This election should be about the issues facing our country and how to make America successful, safe, free and great again. In an age when our politics too often divide us, now is the time to remember that we are all fellow citizens — we are one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. And we must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement, which is what's been happening in our country lately, at a level that nobody has ever seen before. In that spirit, the Democrat party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy. Especially since that is not true. In fact, I am the one saving democracy for the people of our country. And very big news, as you probably just read. On Monday, a major ruling was handed down from a highly respected federal judge in Florida, Aileen Cannon, finding that the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional, and the entire case was thrown out of court. With all of that publicity — thrown out of court. If Democrats want to unify our country, they should drop these partisan witch hunts, which I've been going through for approximately eight years. And they should do that without delay and allow an election to proceed that is worthy of our people. We're going to win it anyway. But worthy of our people. On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania. And, Melania, thank you very much. You also did something really beautiful, a letter to America calling for national unity. And it really took the Republican Party by surprise, I will tell you; it was beautiful. In fact, some very serious people said that we should take that letter and put it as part of the Republican platform. That would be an honor, wouldn't it? Right? Mr. congressman? But it captivated so many, so … I also want to thank my entire family — Don and Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Lara, Tiffany and Michael, Barron, we love our Barron. And of course, my 10 wonderful grandchildren. You saw a few of them up there on my lap before. And how good was Dana? Was Dana good? I mean, wasn't he good? You know, he was on probably the only vacation he's had in about — maybe ever. Because he works. But about 10 years, with his wife — very far away. I won't tell you where, but very, very far away, beautiful place. And my people called and he said, ""Yeah, I won't be able to do it. This is many, many years. I promised my wife. I can't do it."" And they came and they said, ""Dana won't be able to do it."" Because he was my first, second and third choice. I said, ""Well, you know, that's too bad."" But I understand, he's away and it's good. It's good for him. And that was it. About 30 minutes later, she came back in: ""Sir, Dana just called; he's going to do it."" And his wife, she said, ""You can't turn him down. You just can't do it. You have to go."" That's a good wife. So he got in a plane, he got here a little while ago. Now he's going to get on the plane in a little while and he's going to go back home to his wife. But they're great. And I just want to thank her and him and their whole family because that's not easy. And Kid Rock, same thing. Called, he said, ""I want to be a part of it."" I want to be a part, because, you know, Kid does this great song. Big, big monster song. I had no idea. You know, he became a friend of mine over the last 10 years. And, uh, he's amazing. Everyone loves him. I didn't even know how big he was. You know, he has rallies. Thirty-five, 40,000 people he gets, every time he goes out. I think he's making so much money he doesn't know what the hell to do with it, you want to know ... And then we have my other friend, and I've known him so long and we took that song and it was a big success. But we made that. I saw a chart of great songs to America. That was No. 1 on the chart recently. No. 1, so. That's Lee Greenwood, very special, beautiful person. He's a beautiful man. But they all wanted to be here. They called … And how about the Hulkster? How good was he? You see that? Where is he? Boy, oh boy. You know, they may call it, they may call that entertainment. I know about entertainment, but when he used to lift a 350-pound man over his shoulders and then bench press him two rows into the audience, I say maybe entertainment, but he is one strong son of a gun, I tell you. I watched it many times. There aren't a lot of entertainers that could do that, right? You were fantastic. Thank you very much. Followed by … Eric? What was that all about? Boy, that was good. I didn't want to really come up here. But he was so great. And he's such a good young man. He went through a lot of trouble, and Don, last night, was incredible. They went through so much trouble. They got subpoenaed more than any people probably in the history of the United States. Every week they get another subpoena from the Democrats. Crazy Nancy Pelosi, the whole thing. Just boom, boom, boom. They've got to stop that because they're destroying our country. We have to work on making America great again, not on beating people. And we won. We beat them in all. We beat them on the impeachments. We beat them on the indictments. We beat them. But the time that you have to spend, the time that you have to spend. If they would devote that genius to helping our country, we'd have a much stronger and better country. And Jason. The biggest star in country music. Jason, thank you for being here. Jason, thank you very much. Jason Aldean, he's good. I like his wife even better, by the way. She's here. Thank you, Jason. But I'm thrilled to have a new friend and partner fighting by my side: the next vice president of the United States, the current senator from Ohio, J.D. Vance, and his incredible wife, Usha. He's going to be a great vice president, he's going to be great. He'll be with this country and with this movement. Greatest movement in the history of our country. Make America Great Again. When they criticize it, they say, ""We're going to try and stop MAGA."" MAGA is ""Make America Great Again."" What are you going to stop? There's nothing to stop. Then they say, ""Oh, that's right."" It's very tough to fight it. And all of the people that did try and fight it have failed, but he's going to be with us for a long time, and it was an honor to select him. Great, great student at Yale. His wife was a student at Yale; they met at Yale. These are two smart people. So J.D., you're going to be doing this for a long time; enjoy the ride. And a very special thank you to the extraordinary people of Milwaukee and the great state of — oh, there they are. There they are, that's — You are so easy to spot. And Green Bay's going to have a good team this year, right? They're going to have a good team. They're going to have a good team. Most of the audience doesn't like it, but it's true. You're going to have a very good team this year. And by the way, Wisconsin, we are spending over $250 million here, creating jobs and other economic … development all over the place. So I hope you will remember this in November and give us your vote. I am trying to buy your vote. I'll be honest about that. And I promise we will make Wisconsin great again. We're going to make this ... Thank you. Mr. governor, thank you very much. Thank you. I am here tonight to lay out a vision for the whole nation. To every citizen, whether you're a young or old, man or woman, Democrat, Republican or Independent, Black or white, Asian or Hispanic, I extend to you a hand of loyalty and of friendship. Together, we will lead America to new heights of greatness like the world has never seen before. We were right there in the first term. We got hit with Covid. We did a great job. Nobody knew what it was. But nobody's ever seen an economy pre-Covid, and then we handed over a stock market that was substantially higher than just prior to Covid. Coming in, did a great job. Never got credit for that. We got credit for the war and defeating ISIS and so many things. The great economy. The biggest tax cuts ever. The biggest regulation cuts ever. The creation of Space Force, the rebuilding of our military. We did so much. We do so much. Right to Try, Right to Try is a big deal. We've got Right to Try. They were trying to get that for 52 years. Somebody's terminally ill. And hopefully there's nobody in this audience, but it does happen, a lot. They're terminally ill and they can't use our new space-age drugs and other things that we are way ahead with. We have the greatest doctors in the world. The greatest laboratories in the world, and you can't do it. They've been trying to get that approved for 52 years, wasn't that easy. The insurance companies didn't want to do it. They didn't want the risk. The labs didn't want to do it because if it didn't work, people are pretty far down the line toward death. They didn't want to do it. The doctors didn't want to have it on their record. So I got everybody into an office — 52 years, they tried. Sounds simple, but it's not. And I got them to agree that somebody that needs it will, instead of going to Asia or Europe or some place, or if you have no money, going home and dying — just die — we got them to sign an agreement. They agreed to it, where they're not going to sue anybody. They can get all of this stuff. They're going to get it really fast, and what's happened is we're saving thousands and thousands of lives. It's incredible. Right to Try. It's … great feeling. Under our leadership, the United States will be respected again. No nation will question our power. No enemy will doubt our might. Our borders will be totally secure. Our economy will soar. We will return law and order to our streets, patriotism to our schools, and importantly, we will restore peace, stability and harmony all throughout the world. But to achieve this future, we must first rescue our nation from failed and even incompetent leadership. We have totally incompetent leadership. This will be the most important election in the history of our country. Under the current administration, we are indeed a nation in decline. We have an inflation crisis that is making life unaffordable, ravaging the incomes of working and low-income families, and crushing, just simply crushing our people like never before. They've never seen anything like it. We also have an illegal immigration crisis, and it's taking place right now, as we sit here in this beautiful arena. It's a massive invasion at our southern border that has spread misery, crime, poverty, disease, and destruction to communities all across our land. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. Then there is an international crisis, the likes of which the world has seldom been part of. Nobody can believe what's happening. War is now raging in Europe and the Middle East, a growing specter of conflict hangs over Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines, and all of Asia, and our planet is teetering on the edge of World War III, and this will be a war like no other war because of weaponry. The weapons are no longer army tanks going back and forth, shooting at each other. These weapons are obliteration. It's time for a change. This administration can't come close to solving the problems. We're dealing with very tough, very fierce people. They're fierce people. And we don't have fierce people. We have people that are a lot less than fierce, except when it comes to cheating on elections and a couple of other things, then they're fierce. Then they're fierce. So tonight, I make this pledge to the great people of America. I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates and lower the cost of energy . We will drill, baby, drill. Can you believe what they're doing? But by doing that, we will lead a large-scale decline in prices. Prices will start to come down. Energy… Raised it, they took our energy policies and destroyed them. Then they immediately went back to them, but by that time, so much was lost. But we will do it at levels that nobody's ever seen before, and we'll end lots of different things. We'll start paying off debt and start lowering taxes even further. We gave you the largest tax cut. We'll do it more. Now, people don't realize, I brought taxes way down, way, way down. And yet we took in more revenues the following year than we did when the tax rate was much higher. Most people said, how did you do that? Because it was incentive. Everybody was coming to the country, they were bringing back billions and billions of dollars into our country. The companies made it impossible to bring it back. The tax rate was too high and the legal complications were far too great. I changed both of them, and hundreds of billions of dollars by Apple and so many other companies would work back into our nation, and we had an economy the likes of which nobody, no nation had ever seen. China, we were beating them at levels that were incredible. And they know it. They know it. We'll do it again, but we'll do it even better. I will end the illegal immigration crisis by closing our border and finishing the wall, most of which I've already built. On the wall, we were dealing with a very difficult Congress and I said, ""Oh, that's OK. We won't go to Congress."" I call it an ""invasion."" We gave our military almost $800 billion. I said, ""I'm going to take a little of that money, because this is an 'invasion.'"" And we built — Most of the wall is already built, and we built it through using the funds, because what's more, what's better than that? We have to stop the invasion into our country that's killing hundreds of thousands of people a year. We're not going to let that happen. I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created, including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine, which would have never happened if I was president. And the war caused by the attack on Israel, which would never have happened if I was president. Iran was broke. Iran had no money. Now Iran has $250 billion. They made it all over the last two and a half years. They were broke. I watched the other day on a show called ""Deface the Nation,"" has anyone seen it? And they had a congressman who was a Democrat say, Well, whether you like him or not, Iran was broke dealing with Trump. I told China and other countries, ""If you buy from Iran, we will not let you do any business in this country, and we will put tariffs on every product you do send in of 100 percent or more."" And they said to me, Well, I think that's about it. They weren't going to buy any oil. And they were ready to make a deal. Iran was going to make a deal with us. And then we had that horrible, horrible result that we'll never let happen again. The election result. We're never going to let that happen again. They used Covid to cheat. We're never going to let it happen again. And they took off all the sanctions, and they did everything possible for Iran and now Iran is very close to having a nuclear weapon, which would have never happened. This is a shame, what this administration, the damage that this administration has done. And I say it often. If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States. Think of it. The 10 worst. Added them up, they will not have done the damage that Biden has done. Only going to use the term once. Biden. I'm not going to use the name anymore. Just one time. The damage that he's done to this country is unthinkable. It's unthinkable. Together, we will restore vision, strength, competence and we're going to have a thing called common sense making most of our decisions actually. It's all common sense. Just a few short years ago under my presidency, we had the most secure border and the best economy in the history of our country, in the history of the world. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had never done anything like it. We were beating every country, including China, by leaps and bounds. Nobody had seen anything like it. We had no inflation, soaring incomes, we're going — Nobody's — Nobody can believe it. You can't believe what happened four years ago is happening now in reverse. And the world was at peace. Inflation has been a killer for our country. No matter what you're making, it doesn't matter because inflation is eating you alive. People that were putting away money, they were making great wages. The highest they've ever made. But they were putting away a lot of money. Now they are just being destroyed. They're not putting away anything. They're barely living. They're going into saving accounts. They're taking out their money to live because of inflation. Inflation, remember, it's called a country buster. You can go back to Germany from 100 years ago. You can go back to any country that's suffered great inflation. We've suffered the worst inflation we've ever had. But go back and see what's happened to those countries. We've had the worst inflation we've ever had under this person. But in less than four years, our opponents have turned incredible success into unparalleled tragedy and failure. It's been a tremendous failure. Today, our cities are flooded with illegal aliens. Americans are being squeezed out of the labor force and their jobs are taken. By the way, you know who's taking the jobs, the jobs that are created? One hundred and seven percent of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens. And you know who's being hurt the most by millions of people pouring into our country? The Black population and the Hispanic population. Because they're taking the jobs from our Black population, our Hispanic population. And they're also taking them from unions. The unions are suffering because of it. Thank you. Thank you. I like you too. Thank you very much. Inflation has wiped out the life savings of our citizens, and forced the middle class into a state of depression and despair. That's what it is. It's despair and depression. We cannot, and will not, let this continue. Less than four years ago, we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again. We're going to be a great nation again. Thank you. With proper leadership, every disaster we are now enduring will be fixed — and it will be fixed very, very quickly. So tonight, whether you've supported me in the past or not, I hope you will support me in the future, because I will bring back the American dream. That's what we're going to do. You don't even hear about the American dream anymore. With great humility, I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country. Be excited. Be excited. And by the way, the news reports. All, look at all of those big networks. Look at them. They're all here. But everyone one of them has said this could be the most organized, best run and most enthusiastic convention of either party that they've ever seen. Every single one. And it's true. It's true. And there's love in the room. There's great love in the room. So I'd better finish strong. Otherwise, we'll blow it, and we can't let that happen. No, this was great. All of the great people that spoke and everybody hit a home run. I mean, there's not one that I can think of where I said, ""Oh, gee, that wasn't great."" Every single person. I refuse to be the only one. Don't do that to me. They're already getting ready. See, I gave them an idea. No, we had a, this was a great convention. This was — I think we're actually going to go home and miss it. You know usually with a — First of all, look at these crowds. You'd never have this at a convention. Look at these crowds. Love, it's about love. This week, the entire Republican Party has formally adopted an agenda for America's renewal. And you saw that agenda, and it's very short compared to the long, boring, meaningless agendas of the past. Including the Democrats. They write these things that are hundreds of pages long and they never read them after they're done. In their case, fortunately they don't read them because they're pretty bad. It's a series of bold promises that we will swiftly implement when you give us a Republican House. And Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. We have our great speaker of the House with us tonight. Mr. Speaker, thank you very muc","h. Thank you. A Republican Senate. We have many senators here. And send me back to our beautiful White House just a few short months from now. We're talking about just months. It can't come fast enough. We have to get it done. First, we must get economic relief to our citizens. Starting on Day 1, we will drive down prices and make America affordable again. We have to make it affordable. It's not affordable. People can't live like this. Under this administration, our current administration, groceries are up 57 percent, gasoline is up 60 and 70 percent, mortgage rates have quadrupled, and the fact is it doesn't matter what they are because you can't get the money anyway. Can't buy houses. Young people can't get any financing to buy a house. The total household costs have increased an average of $28,000 per family under this administration. Republicans have a plan to bring down prices, and bring them down very, very rapidly. By slashing energy costs, we will in turn reduce the cost of transportation, manufacturing and all household goods. So much starts with energy. And remember, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country by far. We are a nation that has the opportunity to make an absolute fortune with its energy. We have it and China doesn't. Under the Trump administration just three and a half years ago, we were energy independent. But soon we will actually be better than that. We will be energy dominant and supply not only ourselves, but we will supply the rest of the world. With numbers that nobody has ever seen and we will reduce our debt, $36 trillion. We will start reducing that. And we will also reduce your taxes still further. Next, and by the way they want to raise your taxes four times. Think of it. And all my life I grew up watching politicians. I always loved politics, I guess. I was on the other side. I'd watch the — and they were always talking about we will give you a tax cut, we will give you a tax cut. My whole life I was watching I will give you a tax cut, right Mr. Congressman? That's all they talked about. This is the only administration that said we're going to raise your taxes by four times what you're paying now. And people are supposed to vote for them? I've never heard it. You're paying too much, we're going to reduce your taxes still further. We gave you the biggest one, as I said. We're going to give you more and it's going to lead to tremendous growth. We want growth in our country. That's what's going to pay off our debt. And next, we will end the ridiculous and actually incredible waste of taxpayer dollars that is fueling the inflation crisis. They've spent trillions of dollars of things having to do with the Green New Scam. It's a scam. And that has caused tremendous inflationary pressures in addition to the cost of energy. And all of the trillions of dollars that are sitting there not yet spent, we will redirect that money for important projects like roads, bridges, dams and we will not allow it to be spent on the meaningless Green New scam ideas. And I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one. Thereby saving the U.S. auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now and saving U.S. customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car. And right now as we speak, large factories, just started, are being built across the border in Mexico. So, with all the other things happening at our border, and they're being built by China to make cars and to sell them into our country, no tax, no anything. The United Autoworkers ought to be ashamed for allowing this to happen and the leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately and every single autoworker, union and nonunion, should be voting for Donald Trump because we're going to bring back car manufacturing and we're going to bring it back fast. They are building some of the largest auto plants anywhere in the world. Think of it. In the world. And we are going to bring it back. We're going to make them. We don't mind the — We don't mind it happening but plants will be built in the United States and our people are going to man those plants. And if they don't agree with us, we'll put a tariff of approximately 100 to 200 percent on each car and they will be unsellable in the United States. We have long been taken advantage of by other countries. And think of it, oftentimes these other countries are considered so-called allies. They've taken advantage of us for years. We lose jobs. We lose revenue and they gain everything and wipe out our businesses, wipe out our people. I stopped it for four years, I stopped it. And we're really ready to make changes like nobody had seen before. And remember, U.S.M.C.A. I got rid of NAFTA the worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with U.S.M.C.A. which is, they say, the best trade deal ever made. Actually, probably the best trade deal was the deal I made with China where they buy $50 billion of our product. They were buying nothing. They buy $50 billion worth. They had to but I don't even talk about it because of Covid. I don't even mention it frankly because of what happened with the China virus. We will not let countries come in, take our jobs, and plunder our nation. They come and do that. They plunder our nation. The way they will sell their product in America is to build it in America, very simple. Build it in America and only in America. And this very simple formula, and congress has to go along with us and they will. This very simple formula will create massive numbers of jobs. We will take over the auto industry again and many many, hundreds of thousands of jobs, we lost so many jobs over the years. If you go back 20, 25 years they've stolen, going to China and Mexico, about 68 percent of our auto industry. Manufacturing jobs. We're going to get them all back. We're going to get them all back, every single one of them. At the center of our plan for economic relief are massive tax cuts for workers that include something else that stood out to be very popular actually. Here it's very popular. In this building and all those hotels that are so nice, I'm staying in a nice one. It's called no tax on tips. No tax on tips. No tax on tips. And I got that by having dinner recently in Nevada where we're leading by about 14 points. Hello. I'll see you there very soon, everybody. And we were having dinner at a beautiful restaurant in the Trump building on the Strip. And it's a great building and the waitress comes over. ""How's everything going?"" Really nice person. ""How's everything going?"" ""Oh sir, it's so tough. The government is after me all the time on tips, tips, tips."" I said, ""Well, they give you cash, would they be able to find them?"" And she said, ""Actually,"" and I didn't know this, very little cash is given. It's all put right on the check. And they come in and they take so much of our money it's just ridiculous. And they don't believe anything we say. They've just hired, as you know, 88,000 agents to go after them even more. And I said, ""This shows the level of—"" You know, most people who go out they hire consultants. They pay them of dollars. But I said to her, ""Let me just ask you a question. Would you be happy if you had no tax on tips?"" She said, ""What a great idea."" I got my information from a very smart waitress. That's better than spending millions of dollars. And everybody, everybody loves it. Waitresses and caddies and drivers and everybody. It's a large, large group of people that are being hurt badly. They make money, let them keep their money. I am going to protect Social Security and Medicare. Democrats are going to destroy Social Security and Medicare because all of these people, by the millions, they're coming in. They're going to be on Social Security and Medicare and other things and you're not able to afford it. They are destroying your Social Security and your Medicare. Under my plan, incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish completely, jobs will come roaring back, and the middle class will prosper like never, ever before and we're going to do it very rapidly. But no hope or dream we have for America can succeed unless we stop the illegal immigrant invasion. The worst that's ever been seen anywhere in the world. There's never been an invasion anywhere. Third world countries would fight with sticks and stones not to let this happen. The invasion at our southern border, we will stop it and we will stop it quickly. You heard Tom Homan yesterday. Tom Homan, put him in charge and just sit back and watch. Brandon Judd, a border patrol, he's incredible. These guys they, you know, they, they really their job is a lot easier if they don't have to do anything but they want to. They're patriots. Brandon Judd. Border Patrol. ICE. ICE goes out. You have to see what ICE does with M.S. 13. You have, these, these are probably the worst gang and ICE goes in there. And I know a lot of people in these rows here. And they're very tough people. But they don't want to do this job. They'll go into a pack of M.S. 13 killers. They're the worst, probably the worst gangs in the world. We have thousands of them. I moved thousands and thousands out in my four years. We moved them out. And it was a pleasure, but ICE would go right into a pack of these killers. And you see fist flying, you see everything flying and they take them. They put them in a paddy wagon. They take them back and they get them out of our country. And the other countries weren't accepting them back. And I called up and I said tell them that we're not giving them economic aid any more. And the next day I got calls from all these countries that were terminated. Billions of dollars we spend on economic aid to countries that does us frankly no good. And the next day I was called by everybody, I couldn't take all the calls. ""Sir, sir, what's the problem?"" I said, ""You won't take your killers back that you sent in caravans into America. You won't take them back."" ""Well sir, if you'd like us to, we would give very serious consideration to doing that."" In 24 hours, they were being taken back. For years and years when I first came in, they said President Obama tried to get them to go back and they wouldn't accept them. They'd put planes on the runway so you couldn't land the plane. They'd close the roads so you couldn't take the buses; they'd all have to turn back. As soon as they said no more economic aid of any kind to any country that does that, they called back and they said, ""Sir, it would be our great honor to take M.S. 13. We love them very much. We love them very much, sir. We'll take them back."" At the heart of the Republican platform is our pledge to end this border nightmare, and fully restore the sacred and sovereign borders of the United States of America. And we're going to do that on Day 1. That means two things on Day 1, right? Drill, baby, drill and close our borders. And by the way, and I think everybody as a Republican, as a patriot in this. Less than four years ago, I handed this administration the strongest border in American history. But you can see on the chart that saved my life. That was the chart that saved my life. I said, ""Look at, I'm so proud of it."" I think it's one of the greatest — it was done by the Border Patrol — one of the greatest charts I've ever seen. It showed everything, just like that. You know the chart. Oh, there it is. That's pretty good. Wow. Last time I put up that chart I never really got to look at it. But without that chart, I would not be here today. Never got to look at it. I said, ""You've got to see this chart."" I was so proud of it. But by the time I got to there. I never got to see it that day. But I'm seeing it now and I was very proud. If you look at the arrow on the bottom, that's the lowest level, the one on the bottom, heavy red arrow, that's the lowest level of illegal immigrants ever to come into our country in recorded history. Right there. Right there. And that was my last week in office. And then you see what happened after I left. Look at the rest. And if you go out a little bit further, it's getting to be a little bit old, but I love it anyway right, but you can go much higher with those numbers. Look what happened right after that. The invasion began. We had the opposite. We stopped the invasion. But the invasion we stopped was peanuts by comparison to what happened after I left. Look at what happened after I left. They took over our country. We ended all catch-and-release. We shut down asylum fraud. We stopped human trafficking and forged historic agreements to keep illegal aliens on foreign soil. We want them to stay on their soil. Under the Trump administration, if you came in illegally, you were apprehended immediately and you were deported. You went right back. The current administration terminated every single one of those great Trump policies that I put in place to seal the border. I wanted a sealed border. Again, come in but come in legally. You know how unfair it is? So many people, hundreds of thousands of people have been working for years to come into our country. And now they see these people pour into our country at levels that are unprecedented. So unfair. And we're not going to do it. We're not going to stand for it. They suspended wall construction, ended ""Remain in Mexico."" We had a policy, ""Remain in Mexico."" You think that was easy to get from the Mexican government? But I said, ""You must give it to us. If you don't give it to us, there will be repercussions."" And they gave it to us, but not easy. Canceled our Safe Third agreements, demolished Title 42, implemented nationwide catch-and-release. That's catch-and-release where we catch them and release them into our country. I had we catch them and release them into Mexico. There's a slight difference. And took 93, this is the previous administration, 93 executive actions to throw open our border to the world. The entire world is pouring into our country because of this very foolish administration. The greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country. They are coming in from every corner of the earth, not just from South America, but from Africa, Asia, Middle East. They're coming from everywhere. They're coming at levels that we've never seen before. It is an invasion indeed, and this administration does absolutely nothing to stop them. They're coming from prisons. They're coming from jails. They're coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. I, you know the press is always on because I say this. Has anyone seen ""The Silence of the Lambs""? The late, great Hannibal Lecter. He'd love to have you for dinner. That's insane asylums. They're emptying out their insane asylums. And terrorists at numbers that we've never seen before. Bad things are going to happen. Meanwhile, our crime rate is going up, while crime statistics all over the world are going down. Because they're taking their criminals and they're putting them into our country. A certain country, and I happen to like the president of that country very much, but he's been getting great publicity because he's a wonderful shepherd of the country. He says how well the country's doing because their crime rate is down. And he said he's training all of these rough people. They're rough, rough, rough. He's training them. And I've been reading about this for two years. I think, ""Oh that's wonderful, let's take a look at it."" But then I realize he's not training them; he's sending all of his criminals, his drug dealers, his people that are in jails, he's sending them all to the United States. And he's different in that he doesn't say that. He's trying to convince everybody what a wonderful job he does in running the country. Well, he doesn't do a wonderful job. And by the way, if I ran one of the countries, many countries, many, many countries from all over, I would be worse than any of them. I would have had the place totally emptied out already. But we have become a dumping ground for the world, which is laughing at us. They think we're stupid. And they can't believe that they're getting away with what they're getting away with, but they're not going to be getting away with it for long. That's what I can tell you. In Venezuela, Caracas, high crime, high crime. Caracas, Venezuela, really a dangerous place. But not anymore, because in Venezuela, crime is down 72 percent. In fact, if they would ever in this election, I hate to even say that, we will have our next Republican convention in Venezuela because it will be safe. Our cities, our cities will be so unsafe we won't be able, we will not be able to have it there. In El Salvador, murders are down 70 percent. Why are they down? Now, he would have you convinced that because he's trained murderers to be wonderful people, no. They're down because they're sending their murderers to the United States of America. This is going to be very bad. And bad things are going to happen. And you're seeing all the time. That's why, to keep our family safe, the Republican platform promises to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. Even larger than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, from many years ago. You know, he was a moderate but he believed very strongly in borders. He had the largest deportation operation we've ever had. Just recently, I spoke to the grieving mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, a wonderful woman. A precious 12 year-old girl from Houston who last month was tied up, assaulted and strangled to death after walking to the convenience store just a block away from her house. Her body was dumped near the side of the road in a shallow creek, found by some onlookers who couldn't believe what they had witnessed. Charged with Jocelyn's heinous murder, two illegal aliens from Venezuela who came across our border, were in custody and were then released into the country by this horrible, horrible administration that we have right now. I also met recently with the heartbroken mother and sister of Rachel Morin. Rachel was a 37-year-old mom of five beautiful children who was brutally raped and murdered while out on a run. She wanted to keep herself in good shape. It was very important to her. She was murdered. The monster responsible first killed another woman in El Salvador before he was let into America by the White House. This White House let them in. He then attacked a 9-year-old girl and her mother in a home invasion in Los Angeles before murdering Rachel in Maryland. Traveled all throughout the country, doing tremendous damage. Rachel's mother will never be the same. I spent time with her. She will never be the same. I've also met with the wonderful family of Laken Riley, the brilliant 22-year-old nursing student. She was so proud of being first in her class, who was out for a run on the campus of the University of Georgia when she was assaulted, beaten and horrifically killed. Yet another American life was stolen by a criminal alien set free by this administration. These were incredible people we're talking about. These were incredible people who died. Tonight, America, this is my vow. I will not let these killers and criminals into our country. I will keep our sons and daughters safe. As we bring security to our streets, we will help bring stability to the world. I was the first president in modern times to start no new wars. You know, we were the toughest. We were the most respected. And you saw this. Hungary, strong country. Run by a very powerful, tough leader. He's a tough guy. The press doesn't like him because he's tough. And he came out recently. They were asking him at an interview: The whole world is exploding, what's happening, what's going on. Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary, very tough man. He said, ""I don't want people coming into my country and blowing up our shopping centers and killing people."" But they said to him, ""Tell us, what's going wrong? What's happening? What is it?"" He said, ""There's only one way you're going to solve it. You got to bring President Trump back to the United States because he kept everybody at bay."" True. He used a word I wouldn't use because I can't use that word. Because you'd say it was braggadocious. The press would say, ""He was a braggart."" I am not a braggart. But Viktor Orban said it. He said ""Russia was afraid of him. China was afraid of him. Everybody was afraid of him. Nothing was going to happen."" The whole world was at peace, and now the world is blowing up around us. All of these things you read about were not going to happen. Under President Bush, Russia invaded Georgia. Under President Obama, Russia took Crimea. Under the current administration, Russia is after all of Ukraine. Under President Trump, Russia took nothing. We defeated 100 percent of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, something that was said to take ""five years, sir, it'll take five years, sir."" We did it in a matter of a couple months. We have a great military. Our military is not woke. It's just some of the fools on top that are woke. I got along very well, North Korea, Kim Jung Un. I got along very well with him. The press hated when I said that. ""How could you get along with him?"" Well, you know, it's nice to get along with someone who has a lot of nuclear weapons or otherwise. See, in the old days, you'd say that's a wonderful thing. Now they say, ""How can you possibly do that?"" But no, I got along with him and we stopped the missile launches from North Korea. Now, North Korea is acting up again. But when we get back, I get along with him. He'd like to see me back too. I think he misses me, if you want to know the truth. Our opponents inherited a world at peace and turned it into a planet of war. We're in a planet of war. Look at that attack on Israel. Look at what's happening with Ukraine. The cities are just bombed out. How can people live like that, where buildings, massive buildings are falling to the ground. It began to unravel with the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the worst humiliation in the history of our country. We have never had a humiliation like that. Thirteen heroic U.S. service members were tragically and needlessly killed. Forty-five others were horrifically wounded. Nobody ever talks about that. No arms, no legs, face explosions. Horrifically, horrifically wounded. And by the way, we have a man in this room who is running for the U.S. Senate from a great state, Nevada, named Sam Brown, who paid the ultimate price. Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Sam. Thank you. He paid the biggest price probably ever paid by anybody that is running for office, and I think he is going to do great. He's running against a person that is not good, not respected. A total lightweight. But Sam, I think, paid really — We were talking about it with some of the senators that are working so hard for Sam. But he paid the biggest price of any senator ever to run for the Senate. I don't think anybody has ever, what he did. He's a real hero, a really great person. And he's running and I hope that everybody gets out and votes for Sam Brown. And we also left behind $85 billion dollars' worth of military equipment, along with many American citizens were left behind. Many, many American citizens. Emboldened by that disaster, Russia invaded Ukraine. They saw this group of people that were incompetent. We took the soldiers out first, no, no. We're going to take the soldiers out second. If they would have followed my plan; we had a great plan. But the plan only kicked in if they did everything perfectly, and they weren't doing things perfectly. So we said it doesn't kick in. You know, 18 months in Afghanistan, we didn't have one — they were killing them left and right, snipers. And I spoke to the head of the Taliban. You've heard this story. Abdul, still there. Still the head of the Taliban. The press got on me, ""Why would you speak to him?"" I said, ""Because that's where the killing is."" I don't have to speak to somebody that has nothing to do with it. And I told him: ""Don't ever do that. Don't ever do that again. Don't ever, ever do that again, you're going to stop."" Because during the Obama administration, many great people and soldiers, a lot of soldiers, were being killed from long distance. I said, ""If you keep doing that, you're going to be hit harder than anybody has ever been hit by a country before."" And he said, ""I understand, Your Excellency."" He called me ""Your Excellency."" I wonder if he calls the other guy ""Your Excellency."" I doubt it. The other guy gave him everything. I mean, what kind of a deal was that? He walked out, gave him everything. You know that right now Afghanistan is one of the largest sellers of weapons in the world? They're selling the brand-new, beautiful weapons that we gave them. But think of it. He actually said to me, ""But why, but why, do you show me a picture of my home?"" I said, ""You'll have to ask your people or one of your wives."" But he could figure it out. And for 18 months we had not one attack on an American soldier by the Taliban. Eighteen months. And then we had that horrible day where soldiers were killed. I was not there because of a ridiculous election. But we had that horrible attack. And they also gave up Bagram, one of the biggest bases anywhere in the world, air bases, anywhere in the world. The longest runways, most powerful hardened, thickened runways. We gave it up. And I liked it not because of Afghanistan, I liked it because of China. It's one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons. And you know who has it now? China has it now. We were keeping that, and now China is likewise circling Taiwan, and Russian warships and nuclear submarines are operating 60 miles off the coast in Cuba. Do you know that? The press refuses to write about it. If that were me running this country and we had nuclear submarines in Cuba, I will tell you that headlines every day would be ""What's Wrong With Our President?"". You don't even hear this. You're not hearing about this. Russia has nuclear submarines and warships 60 miles away, Mr. Congressman. From Miami, by the way, happens to be here. Correct? In Cuba. That would not be stood for if it were somebody else. They don't want to mention it, but now maybe they will. And to the entire world, I tell you this, we want our hostages back — and they better be back before I assume office, or you will be paying a very big price. With our victory in November, the years of war, weakness and chaos will be over. I don't have wars. I had no wars, other than ISIS, which I defeated, but that was a war that was started. We had no wars. I could stop wars with a telephone call. I could stop wars with just a telephone call. It properly stated it would never start. We will replenish our military and build an iron dome missile defense system to ensure that no enemy can strike our homeland. And this great iron dome will be built entirely in the U.S.A. We're going to build it in the U.S.A. And Wisconsin, Wisconsin, just like I gave you that massive ship contract, and you're doing a very nice job, governor, right? Thank you, governor. And they're doing a great job. In fact, I had a little design change and we gave them a tremendous for, essentially, what we used to call destroyers. These are now the most beautiful. They look like yachts. I said, ""We have to take the bow, and we have to make it a little nicer, and a little point at the top instead of a flat nose."" And the people at the shipyards said, ""This guy sort of knows what he's doing."" We had the most beautiful ships, right, governor? And everybody sitting over there? And it was a big contract that everybody wanted. I gave it to Wisconsin, but we're going to have a lot of that built right here in the state of Wisconsin and all other states. Israel has an Iron Dome. They have a missile defense system. Three hundred forty-two missiles were shot into Israel, and only one got through a little bit. It was badly wounded, it fell to the ground, but most of them are — And Ronald Reagan wanted this many years ago, but we really didn't have the technology many years ago. Remember, they called it starship, spaceship, anything to mock him. But he was a very good president, very, very good. But now we have unbelievable technology. And why should other countries have this, and we don't? No, no, we're going to build an iron dome over our country, and we're going to be sure that nothing can come and harm our people. And again, from an economic development standpoint, I'm going to make it all right here. No more sending it out to other countries in order to help. It's America first, America first. We will unleash the power of American innovation, and as we do, we will soon be on the verge of finding the cures to cancer, Alzheimer's disease and many other diseases. We're going to get to the bottom of it. You remember this gentleman that I don't want to mention, other than one time I had to, because when you say ""the 10 worst,"" I had to do it. I didn't want anybody to be confused. But this man said we're going to find a cure to cancer; nothing happened. We're going to get to the cure for cancer and Alzheimer's and so many other things. We're so close to doing something great. But we need a leader that will let it be done. We will not have men playing in women's sports. That will end immediately. And we will restore and renovate our nation's once-great cities, making them safe, clean and beautiful again. And that includes our nation's capital, which is a horrible killing field. So many things — they leave from Wisconsin, they go to look at the Washington Monument, they end up getting stabbed, killed or shot. We will be, very soon, very proud of our capital again, Washington, D.C. America's on the cusp of a new golden age, but we will have the courage to seize it. We're going to take it, we're going to make it a current — I mean, we're going to bring this into a golden age like never seen b","efore. Remember this: China wants to do it, Japan wants to do it. All of these countries want to do it. We have to produce massive amounts of energy. If we're going to produce the new — if you look at some of the things that have been done, and some of the things that we're going to do. But A.I. needs tremendous — literally, twice the electricity that's available now in our country, can you imagine? But instead we're spending places where they recharge electric cars. They built eight chargers at a certain location, toward the Midwest. Eight chargers for $9 billion? Think of them as a tank for filling up your gas. Think of it. They spent $9 billion on eight chargers, three of which didn't work. And if you are going to do this all over our country, this crazy electric Band-Aid. If you're going to do this … And by the way, I'm all for electric. They have their application. But if somebody wants to buy a gas-powered car, gasoline-powered car, or a hybrid, they're going to be able to do it. And we're going to make that change on Day 1. So, to conclude, just a few short days ago, my journey with you nearly ended. We know that. And yet, here we are tonight, all gathered together, talking about the future, promise and a total renewal of a thing we love very much. It's called America. We live in a world of miracles. None of us knows God's plan, or where life's adventure will take us. I want to thank Franklin Graham for being here tonight; he's an outstanding man. He wrote me a note recently; I have a lot of respect for him. ""Sir, I love your storytelling, I think it's great, in front of these big rallies, but, sir, please do me one favor. It won't make any difference. Please. Don't use any foul language."" I was a little embarrassed, I said. He said, ""It won't make any difference."" Actually, it does, the story's not quite as good, but I've been very good. The story is not quite as good, to be honest. I've got to have a little talk with Franklin, but he was great. He's a great gentleman, his father was so incredible, Billy Graham. My father used to love taking me to see Billy Graham. My father would take me to see Billy Graham at Yankee Stadium. He had the biggest rallies you've ever seen. He was a good rally guy, too. But he'd get up and he was a fantastic guy. My father loved Billy Graham. But I love Franklin Graham, I think Franklin's been fantastic. And I'm trying, I'm just working so hard to adhere to his note to me. I'm working hard on it, Franklin. But if the events of last Saturday make anything clear, it is that every single moment we have on Earth is a gift from God. We have to make the most of every day for the people and for the country that we love. The attacker in Pennsylvania wanted to stop our movement, but the truth is, the movement has never been about me. It has always been about you. It's your movement. It's the biggest movement in the history of our country by far. It can't be stopped. It can't be stopped. It has always been about the hardworking, patriotic citizens of America. For too long, our nation has settled for too little. We settled for too little. We've given everything to other nations, to other people. You have been told to lower your expectations and to accept less for your families. I am here tonight with the opposite message: Your expectations are not big enough. They're not big enough. It is time to start expecting and demanding the best leadership in the world, leadership that is bold, dynamic, relentless and fearless. We can do that. We are Americans. Ambition is our heritage. Greatness is our birthright. But as long as our energies are spent fighting each other, our destiny will remain out of reach. And that's not acceptable. We must instead take that energy and use it to realize our country's true potential — and write our own thrilling chapter of the American story. We can do it together. We will unite. We are going to come together and success will bring us together. It is a story of love, sacrifice and so many other things. And remember the word: Devotion. It's unmatched devotion. Our American ancestors crossed the Delaware, survived the icy winter at Valley Forge and defeated a mighty empire to establish our cherished republic. They fought so hard, they lost so many. They pushed thousands and thousands of miles across a dangerous frontier, taming the wilderness to build a life and a magnificent home for their family. They packed their families into covered wagons, trekked across hazardous trails. Scaled towering mountains and braved rivers and rapids to stake their claim on the wide-open, new and very beautiful frontier. When our way of life was threatened, American patriots marched onto the battlefield, raced into enemy strongholds and stared down death — and stared down those enemies — to keep alive the flame of freedom. At Yorktown, Gettysburg, and Midway, they joined the roll call of immortal heroes. So many — just so many heroes, so many great, great people. And we have to cherish those people. We can't forget those people. We have to cherish those people. And building monuments to those great people is a good thing, not a bad thing. They saved our country. No challenge was too much. No hardship was too great. No enemy was too fierce. Together, these patriots soldiered on and endured, and they prevailed. Because they had faith in each other, faith in their country, and above all, they had faith in their God. Just like our ancestors, we must now come together, rise above past differences. Any disagreements have to be put aside, and go forward united as one people, one nation, pledging allegiance to one great, beautiful — I think it's so beautiful — American flag. Tonight, I ask for your partnership, for your support and I am humbly asking for your vote. I want your vote. We're going to make our country great again. Every day, I will strive to honor the trust you have placed in me, and I will never, ever let you down. I promise that. I will never let you down. To all of the forgotten men and women who have been neglected, abandoned and left behind, you will be forgotten no longer. We will press forward, and together, we will win, win, win. Win, win, win, win, win, win. Nothing will sway us. Nothing will slow us. And no one will ever stop us. No matter what dangers come our way, no matter what obstacles lie in our path, we will keep striving toward our shared and glorious destiny — and we will not fail. We will not fail. Together, we will save this country, we will restore the republic, and we will usher in the rich and wonderful tomorrows that our people so truly deserve. America's future will be bigger, better, bolder, brighter, happier, stronger, freer, greater and more united than ever before. And quite simply put, we will very quickly make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Wisconsin. God bless you, God bless you, Wisconsin, and God bless the United States of America, our great country. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.",""

Vance, Address Accepting the Vice Presidential Nomination at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373579",19803,"Greetings, Milwaukee. My fellow Americans and my fellow Republicans, my name is J.D. Vance, from the great state of Ohio. Tonight — O-H-I-O. You guys, we gotta chill with the Ohio love. We gotta win Michigan too here, so. My friends, tonight is a night of hope. A celebration of what America once was, and with God's grace, what it will soon be again. And it is a reminder of the sacred duty we have to preserve the American experiment, to choose a new path for our children and grandchildren. But as we meet tonight, we cannot forget that this evening could have been so much different. Instead of a day of celebration, this could have been a day of heartache and mourning. For the last eight years, President Trump has given everything he has to fight for the people of our country. He didn't need politics, but the country needed him. Now, prior to running for president, he was one of the most successful businessmen in the world. He had everything anyone could ever want in a life. And yet, instead of choosing the easy path, he chose to endure abuse, slander and persecution. And he did it because he loves this country. I want all Americans to watch the video of a would-be assassin coming a quarter of an inch from taking his life. Consider the lies they told you about Donald Trump. And then look at that photo of him defiant — fist in the air. When Donald Trump rose to his feet in that Pennsylvania field — all of America stood with him. And what did he call for us to do for his country? To fight. To fight for America. Even in his most perilous moment we were on his mind. His instinct was for us, for our country. To call us to something higher. To something greater. To once again be citizens who ask what our country needs of us. Now consider what they said. They said he was a tyrant. They said he must be stopped at all costs. But how did he respond? He called for national unity, for national calm literally right after an assassin nearly took his life. He remembered the victims of the terrible attack, especially the brave Corey Comperatore, who gave his life to protect his family. God bless him. And then President Trump flew to Milwaukee and got back to work. Now that's the man I've gotten to know personally over the last few years. He is tough, and he is, but he cares about people. He can stand defiant against an assassin one moment and call for national healing the next. He is a beloved father and grandfather, and, of course, a once-in-a-generation business leader. He's the man who's feared by America's adversaries, but two nights ago, and I'll share a moment, said good night to his two boys, told them he loved them, and made sure to give each of them a kiss on the cheek. And I will say, Don and Eric squirmed the same way my 4-year-old does when his daddy tries to give him a kiss on the cheek. Sorry, guys. He is all those things, but tonight, we celebrate. He is our once and future president of the United States of America. Now, I want to respond to his call for unity myself. We have a big tent on this party, on everything from national security to economic policy. But my message to you, my fellow Republicans, is — we love this country and we are united to win. Now I think our disagreements actually make us stronger. That's what I've learned in my time in the United States Senate, where sometimes I persuade my colleagues and sometimes they persuade me. And my message to my fellow Americans, those watching from across the country, is shouldn't we be governed by a party that is unafraid to debate ideas and come to the best solution? That's the Republican Party of the next four years: united in our love for this country, and committed to free speech and the open exchange of ideas. And so tonight, Mr. Chairman, I stand here humbled, and I'm overwhelmed with gratitude to say I officially accept your nomination to be vice president of the United States of America. Now, never in my wildest imagination could I have believed that I could be standing here tonight. I grew up in Middletown, Ohio, a small town where people spoke their minds, built with their hands, and loved their God, their family, their community and their country with their whole hearts. But it was also a place that had been cast aside and forgotten by America's ruling class in Washington. When I was in the fourth grade, a career politician by the name of Joe Biden supported NAFTA, a bad trade deal that sent countless good jobs to Mexico. When I was a sophomore in high school, that same career politician named Joe Biden gave China a sweetheart trade deal that destroyed even more good American middle-class manufacturing jobs. When I was a senior in high school, that same Joe Biden supported the disastrous invasion of Iraq. And at each step of the way, in small towns like mine in Ohio, or next door in Pennsylvania or Michigan, in other states across our country, jobs were sent overseas and our children were sent to war. [Crowd chants ""Joe must go.""] I agree. And somehow, a real estate developer from New York City by the name of Donald J. Trump was right on all of these issues while Biden was wrong. President Trump knew, even then, that we needed leaders who would put America first. Now, thanks to these policies that Biden and other out-of-touch politicians in Washington gave us, our country was flooded with cheap Chinese goods, with cheap foreign labor— and in the decades to come, deadly Chinese fentanyl. Joe Biden screwed up, and my community paid the price. Now, I was lucky. Despite the closing factories and the growing addiction in towns like mine, in my life, I had a guardian angel by my side. She was an old woman who could barely walk but she was tough as nails. I called her ""Mamaw,"" the name we hillbillies gave to our grandmothers. Mamaw raised me as her own — excuse me — Mamaw raised me as my mother struggled with addiction. Mamaw was in so many ways a woman of contradictions. She loved the Lord, ladies and gentleman. She was a woman of very deep Christian faith. But she also loved the F word. I'm not kidding. She could make a sailor blush. Now, she once told me, when she found out that I was spending too much time with a local kid who was known for dealing drugs, that if I ever hung out with that kid again, she would run him over with her car. That's true. And she said, ""J.D., no one will ever find out about it."" Now, now thanks to that Mamaw, things worked out for me. After 9/11, I did what thousands of other young men my age did in that time of soaring patriotism and love of country: I enlisted in the United States Marines. Semper Fi to my fellow Marines. Now I left the Marines after four years and went to The Ohio State University. I'm sorry Michigan, I had to get that in there. Come on, come on. We've had enough political violence. Let's — Now after Ohio State I went to Yale Law School, where I met my beautiful wife, and I then started businesses to create jobs in the kinds of places I grew up in. Now, my work taught me that there is still so much talent and grit in the American heartland. There really is. But for these places to thrive, we need a leader who fights for the people who built this country. We need a leader who's not in the pocket of big business, but answers to the working man, union and nonunion alike. A leader who won't sell out to multinational corporations, but will stand up for American companies and American industry. A leader who rejects Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's Green New Scam and fights to bring back our great American factories. We need President Donald J. Trump. Some people tell me I've lived the American dream, and of course they're right. And I'm so grateful for it. But the American dream that always counted most was not starting a business or becoming a senator or even being here with you fine people, though it's pretty awesome. My most important American dream was becoming a good husband and a good dad. Of being able to give — I wanted to give my kids the things that I didn't have when I was growing up. And that's the accomplishment that I'm proudest of. That tonight I'm joined by my beautiful wife, Usha, an incredible lawyer and a better mom. And our three beautiful kids, Ewan who's 7, Vivek who's 4, Mirabel who's 2. Now they're back at the hotel, and kids, if you're watching, Daddy loves you very much but get your butts in bed. It's 10 o'clock. But, my friends, things did not work out well for a lot of kids I grew up with. Every now and then I will get a call from a relative back home who asks, ""Did you know so-and-so?"" And I'll remember a face from years ago, and then I'll hear, ""They died of an overdose."" As always, America's ruling class wrote the checks. Communities like mine paid the price. For decades, that divide between the few, with their power and comfort in Washington, and the rest of us only widened. From Iraq to Afghanistan, from the financial crisis to the Great Recession, from open borders to stagnating wages, the people who govern this country have failed and failed again. That is, of course, until a guy named President Donald J. Trump came along. President Trump represents America's last best hope to restore what — if lost — may never be found again. A country where a working-class boy born far from the halls of power can stand on this stage as the next vice president of the United States of America. But, my fellow Americans, here in this stage and watching at home, this moment is not about me; it's about all of us, and it's about who we're fighting for. It's about the auto worker in Michigan, wondering why out-of-touch politicians are destroying their jobs. It's about the factory worker in Wisconsin who makes things with their hands and is proud of American craftsmanship. It's about the energy worker in Pennsylvania and Ohio who doesn't understand why Joe Biden is willing to buy energy from tinpot dictators across the world, when he could buy it from his own citizens right here in our own country. You guys are a great crowd. Wow. And, it's about, our movement is about single moms like mine, who struggled with money and addiction but never gave up. And I'm proud to say that tonight my mom is here, 10 years clean and sober. I love you, Mom. And, you know, Mom, I was thinking. It'll be 10 years officially in January of 2025, and if President Trump's OK with it, let's have the celebration in the White House. And our movement, ladies and gentlemen, it's about grandparents all across this country, who are living on Social Security and raising grandchildren they didn't expect to raise. And while we're on the topic of grandparents, let me tell you another Mamaw story. Now, my Mamaw died shortly before I left for Iraq, in 2005. And when we went through her things, we found 19 loaded handguns. They were — Now, the thing is, they were stashed all over her house. Under her bed, in her closet. In the silverware drawer. And we wondered what was going on, and it occurred to us that towards the end of her life, Mamaw couldn't get around very well. And so this frail old woman made sure that no matter where she was, she was within arms' length of whatever she needed to protect her family. That's who we fight for. That's American spirit. Now, Joe Biden has been a politician in Washington for longer than I've been alive. Thirty-nine years old. Kamala Harris is not much further behind. For half-a-century, he's been the champion of every major policy initiative to make America weaker and poorer. And in four short years, Donald Trump reversed decades of betrayals inflicted by Joe Biden and the rest of the corrupt Washington insiders. He created the greatest economy in history for workers. It really was amazing. There's, there's this chart that shows worker wages. And they stagnated for pretty much my entire life, until President Donald J. Trump came along. Workers' wages went through the roof. And just imagine what he can do with four more years in the White House. Months ago, I heard some young family member observe that their parents' generation — the baby boomers — could afford to buy a home when they first entered the work force. ""But I don't know,"" this person observed, ""if I'll ever be able to afford a home."" The absurd cost of housing is the result of so many failures. And it reveals so much about what's broken in Washington. I can tell you exactly how it happened. Wall Street barons crashed the economy and American builders went out of business. As tradesmen scrambled for jobs, houses stopped being built. The lack of good jobs, of course, led to stagnant wages. And then the Democrats flooded this country with millions of illegal aliens. So citizens had to compete — with people who shouldn't even be here — for precious housing. Joe Biden's inflation crisis, my friends, is really an affordability crisis. And many of the people that I grew up with can't afford to pay more for groceries, more for gas, more for rent, and that's exactly what Joe Biden's economy has given them. So prices soared, dreams were shattered. And China and the cartels sent fentanyl across the border, adding addiction to the heartache. But ladies and gentlemen, that is not the end of our story. We've heard about the villains and their victims; I've talked a lot about that. I've talked a lot about that. But let me tell you about the future. President Trump's vision is so simple and yet so powerful. We're done, ladies and gentlemen, catering to Wall Street. We'll commit to the working man. We're done importing foreign labor, we're going to fight for American citizens and their good jobs and their good wages. We're done buying energy from countries that hate us; we're going to get it right here, from American workers in Pennsylvania and Ohio and across the country. We're done sacrificing supply chains to unlimited global trade, and we're going to stamp more and more products with that beautiful label, ""Made in the U.S.A."" We're going to build factories again, put people to work making real products for American families, made with the hands of American workers. Together, we will protect the wages of American workers — and stop the Chinese Communist Party from building their middle class on the backs of American citizens. Together, we will make sure our allies share in the burden of securing world peace. No more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer. Together, we will send our kids to war only when we must.But as President Trump showed with the elimination of ISIS and so much more, when we punch, we're going to punch hard. Together, we will put the citizens of America first, whatever the color of their skin. We will, in short, make America great again. You know, one of the things that you hear people say sometimes is that America is an idea. And to be clear, America was indeed founded on brilliant ideas, like the rule of law and religious liberty. Things written into the fabric of our Constitution and our nation. But America is not just an idea. It is a group of people with a shared history and a common future. It is, in short, a nation. Now, it is part of that tradition, of course, that we welcome newcomers. But when we allow newcomers into our American family, we allow them on our terms. That's the way we preserve the continuity of this project from 250 years past to hopefully 250 years in the future. And let me illustrate this with a story, if I may. I am, of course, married to the daughter of South Asian immigrants to this country. Incredible people. People who genuinely have enriched this country in so many ways. And, of course, I'm biased, because I love my wife and her family, but I it's true. Now when I proposed to my wife, we were in law school, and I said, ""Honey, I come with $120,000 worth of law school debt, and a cemetery plot on a mountainside in Eastern Kentucky."" And I guess standing here tonight it's just gotten weirder and weirder, honey. But that's what she was getting. Now that cemetery plot in Eastern Kentucky is near my family's ancestral home. And like a lot of people, we came from the mountains of Appalachia into the factories of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Now that's Kentucky coal country, one of the 10 — Now, it's one of the 10 poorest counties in the entire United States of America. They're very hardworking people, and they're very good people. They're the kind of people who would give you the shirt off their back even if they can't afford enough to eat. And our media calls them privileged and looks down on them. But they love this country, not only because it's a good idea, but because in their bones they know that this is their home, and it will be their children's home, and they would die fighting to protect it. That is the source of America's greatness. As a United States senator, I get to represent millions of people in the great state of Ohio with similar stories, and it is the great honor of my life. Now in that cemetery, there are people who were born around the time of the Civil War. And if, as I hope, my wife and I are eventually laid to rest there, and our kids follow us, there will be seven generations just in that small mountain cemetery plot in eastern Kentucky. Seven generations of people who have fought for this country. Who have built this country. Who have made things in this country. And who would fight and die to protect this country if they were asked to. Now. Now that's not just an idea, my friends. That's not just a set of principle. Even though the ideas and the principles are great, that is a homeland. That is our homeland. People will not fight for abstractions, but they will fight for their home. And if this movement of ours is going to succeed, and if this country is going to thrive, our leaders have to remember that America is a nation, and its citizens deserve leaders who put its interests first. Now we won't agree on every issue of course, not even in this room. We may disagree from time to time about how best to reinvigorate American industry and renew American family. That's fine. In fact its more than fine, it's good. But never forget that the reason why this united Republican Party exists, why we do this, why we care about those great ideas and that great history, is that we want this nation to thrive for centuries to come. Now eventually, in that mountain cemetery, my children will lay me to rest. And when they do, I would like them to know that thanks to the work of this Republican Party, the United States of America, it is strong, and as proud and as great as ever. That is who we serve, my friends. That is who we fight for. And the only thing that we need to do right now, the most important thing that we can do for those people, for that American nation that we all love, is to re-elect Donald J. Trump president of the United States. Mr. President, I will never take for granted the trust you have put in me. And what an honor it is to help achieve the extraordinary vision that you have for this country. Now I pledge to every American, no matter your party, I will give you everything I have. To serve you and to make this country a place where every dream you have for yourself, your family and your country will be possible once again. And I promise you one more thing. To the people of Middletown, Ohio, and all the forgotten communities in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio, and every corner of our nation: I promise you this — I will be a vice president who never forgets where he came from. And every single day for the next four years, when I walk into that White House to help President Trump, I will be doing it for you. For your family, for your future and for this great country. Thank you, God bless all of you, and God bless our great country.","","",""

It was a gracious invitation and I was happy to accept. I'll start by making one thing perfectly clear: Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period. Our country is at a critical moment. We have a choice to make. For more than a year, I said a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for President Kamala Harris. After seeing the debate, everyone knows it's true. If we have four more years of Biden or a single day of Harris, our country will be badly worse off. For the sake of our nation, we have to go with Donald Trump. But there's more to it than that. We should acknowledge that there are some Americans who don't agree with Donald Trump a hundred percent of the time. I happen to know some of them, and I want to speak to them tonight. My message to them is simple. You don't have to agree with Trump a hundred percent of the time to vote for him. Take it from me. I haven't always agreed with President Trump, but we agree more often than we disagree. We agree on keeping America strong. We agree on keeping America safe. And we agree that Democrats have moved so far to the left that they're putting our freedoms in danger. I'm here tonight because we have a country to save, and a unified Republican Party is essential for saving her. For those who have some doubts about President Trump, I want to tell you a few things about the commander in chief I know and worked with. As ambassador to the United Nations, I had a front row seat to his national security policies. We sure could use those again. Think about it. When Barack Obama was president, Vladimir Putin invaded Crimea. With Joe Biden as president, Putin invaded all of Ukraine. But when Donald Trump was President, Putin did nothing. No invasions...no invasions, no wars. That was no accident. Putin didn't attack Ukraine because he knew Donald Trump was tough. A strong president doesn't start wars. A strong president prevents wars. Then look at the Middle East. Every problem in that part of the world can be laid at the feet of Iran. The dictator to chant ""death to America"" are the bankrollers and weapons suppliers for Hamas and Hezbollah. They're behind the barbaric massacres and the hostage taking. Once again, compare Trump and Biden. Trump got us out of the insane Iran nuclear deal. He imposed the toughest sanctions ever on Iran, and he eliminated the arch terrorist Qasem Soleimani. Iran was too weak to start any wars. They knew Trump met business and they were afraid. And then there's Joe Biden. He lifted the sanctions. He begged them to get back into the nuclear deal. He surrendered in Afghanistan. He sent every possible sign of weakness. Even now, while Hamas is still holding Americans hostage, Biden is pressuring Israel instead of the terrorists. Between Israel and Hamas, Donald Trump is clear about who is our friend and who is our enemy. Then look at the border. It's the single biggest threat Americans face. Under Joe Biden, migrants are coming into our country by the thousands every day. We have no idea who they are, where they end up, or what they plan to do. And let me remind you, Kamala had one job, one job, and that was to fix the border. Now, imagine her in charge of the entire country. Under Donald Trump, we didn't have the border disaster we have today, and we won't when he is president again. I was proud to serve American President Trump's cabinet, and I'll tell you something you won't hear from the critics. He appreciated advice and input. Americans were well-served by his presidency, even if they didn't agree with him on all things. Now to my fellow Republicans, we must not only be a unified party, we must also expand our party. We are so much better when we are bigger. We are stronger when we welcome people into our party who have different backgrounds and experiences. And right now we need to be strong to save America. This is a defining moment, not only for our party, but for our country. Our fellow Americans are fearful right now. Families are suffering from inflation and wages that don't keep up with prices. Young people are being indoctrinated to think our country is racist and evil. The Jewish community is facing an obscene rise in antisemitism. Too many minorities are trapped in communities devastated by crime. Our foreign enemies win when they see Americans hate each other. They see that today, whether it's on college campuses or in a field in Butler, Pennsylvania. But we can conquer those fears with strength and unity. No president can fix all of our problems alone. We have to do this together. America has an amazing ability to self-correct. In this moment, we have a chance to put aside our differences and focus on what unites us and strengthens our country. Let us join together as a party. Let us come together as a people, as one country, strong and proud. Let us show our children and the world that even on our worst day, we are blessed to live in America. God bless you. Thank you. God bless the United States of America.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373585",4836,"My fellow Republicans. Let's send Joe Biden back to his basement and let's send Donald Trump back to the White House. Life was more affordable when Donald Trump was president. Our border was safer under the Trump administration, and our country was respected when Donald Trump was our commander in Chief. Joe Biden has failed this nation. As a veteran, I was appalled when 13 of our service members were killed in Afghanistan due to Joe Biden's dereliction of duty. As a citizen, as a husband, and as a father, I am alarmed that the current president of the United States lacks the capability to discharge the duties of his office. Our enemies do not confine their designs to between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM. We need a commander in chief who can lead 24 hours a day and seven days a week. America cannot afford four more years of a weekend at Bernie's presidency. But let's be honest, let's be honest here. Biden is just a figurehead. He's a tool for imposing a leftist agenda on the American people. They support open borders, allowing millions and millions of illegal aliens to pour into our country and to burden our communities, but just don't send any to Martha's Vineyard. Then they get really upset. They have unleashed progressive prosecutors across our nation who care more about coddling criminals than about protecting their own communities. They use the unelected bureaucracy to impose their will on us without our consent, and they weaponize political power to target their political opponents like they've done to our own nominee. They want to ban gas automobiles, eliminate second amendment rights, and impose gender ideology on everyone from our infantry men to kindergartners. They stand for DEI, which really means division, exclusion, and indoctrination, and it is wrong. They mandated that you show proof of a COVID vaccine to go to a restaurant, but they oppose requiring proof of citizenship to cast a vote. They can't even define what a woman is. Now, Donald Trump stands in their way and he stands up for America. Donald Trump has been demonized. He's been sued, he's been prosecuted, and he nearly lost his life. We cannot let him down and we cannot let America down. It is the values of this Republican Party that reflect our nation's founding principles. We believe schools should educate, not indoctrinate. We stand for parents' rights including universal school choice. We support law and order not rioting and disorder. We seek a strong focused United States military, not one distracted by a social agenda. We reject entrenched political class and we demand term limits for members of Congress. We stand for fiscal sanity, for low taxes, and for reduced debt. We seek to reclaim the constitutional government as envisioned by our founding fathers by bringing the administrative state to heal once and for all. We believe that you must be a citizen in order to vote, and that photo ID should be required before casting a ballot. We stand for strong borders and believe that our nation must have a shared civic culture. And we oppose any immigration that stands apart or in contrast to our American values. We believe in the principles articulated in the Declaration of Independence: that our rights come not from the generosity of the state, but from the hand of the Almighty, including the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Now, none of this is easy, but it can be done. For decades, my home state saw elections determined by razor thin margins. Today, due to bold leadership, the Democratic Party lies in ruins. The left is in retreat. Freedom reigns supreme. The woke mind virus is dead, and Florida is a solid Republican state. Now, electing Donald Trump gives us the chance to do this all across America, and we have a responsibility to step up and make it happen. We have a responsibility to preserve what George Washington called the Sacred Fire of Liberty. This was a fire that burned in Independence Hall in 1776 when 56 men pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to establish this nation. It's a fire that burned at a cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania when our nation's first Republican president pledged this nation to a new birth of freedom. It's a fire that burned at the foot of the Berlin Wall in 1987 when our nation's 40th president stood in front of that wall and said, ""Mr. Gorbachev, teared down this wall."" This is not a responsibility we should fear. It's a responsibility we should welcome. After all, if not us, who? And if not now, when? Let's make the 45th President of the United States, the 47th President of the United States. Let's elect Republicans up and down the ballot and let's heed the call of our party's nominee to fight, fight, fight for these United States. Thank you. God bless you. Let's win in November. Thank you so much.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373561",13556,"The President. I don't want to ruin her reputation, but lately, seriously, when she and I are together, she looks like my wife Jill. And they go, ""Are you married?"" [Laughter] And we both—I say, ""Yes,"" but I don't tell them who. [Laughter] Anyway. Anyway, thank you, thank you. You all need this like you need another hole in your head on a beautiful day like this—to come in to say hi, and I can't thank you enough. And you kids who got—had to get dressed up, I owe you big. [Laughter] We owe you big. Everybody knows I like kids better than people. [Laughter] Look, folks, there's a lot going on. We're here to have a rally a little bit later on. But you know, John and the Congresswoman and I got involved for the same reason. I come from a family that—we weren't poor, but we were just a basic middle class family, three-bedroom split-level home on a development of 45 homes all the same, and four kids and a grandpop living with us. And we were fine. But my dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay' and mean it."" And that's what it's all about. You may recall—and I'm not going to make this long, I promise you—what—the reason I decided to run back—my son died in 2015. He was a Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service Medal, spent a year in Iraq, volunteered to go with his unit when the—when he went he was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. And so I decided I wasn't going to get engaged in public—I wasn't going to run again. I had been Vice President. I was a professor—a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania at the time. And what happened was that I—I was going to stay out of it. But then what happened was, remember down in Charlottesville, Virginia, when those folks came out of the woods carrying torches and Nazi banners and literally singing the same Nazi—anyway, the same songs sung in Germany in the thirties? And a young woman was killed who was a bystander. And that young woman, I met—I talked to the mother. And the press contacted Trump and asked him—they said, ""Well, what do you think?"" He said, ""There were very good people on both sides""—""very good people."" And honest to God, that's when I decided to run. That's when I decided to run. And because, folks, there's a lot at stake. And I'll end it with this. You know, there's—probably every five or six generations, we reach an inflection point in history where what happens in the near term is going to determine what the next four or five decades look like. The postwar period is over. If we—and look around the world. I just got finished having—you may have seen on television, the—dealing with NATO and all the foreign heads of state—32 of them here for 4 days. And you know, every—whether it's climate change, whether it's—anyway, I won't go through—into it all, but there's a lot—there's a lot—changing, not because of Joe Biden being President, but just a time of significant movement we're in. And what happens in the next several years is going to determine what the next several decades look like. I mean, for real. Not a joke. We're either going to step up and do something about the environment. We're going to need to make sure that middle class folks have a fighting chance to make it. We're going to either decide we're going to provide health care for people who need it. We're going to—we have to—and I think, when Debbie and I were—this last 3 years, I think we've made a lot of progress. We've made a lot of progress. I remember everybody—— Hi, how are you? How old are you? Audience member. Fourteen. The President. Remember, no serious guys until you're 30. Okay? [Laughter] Audience member. All right. The President. I told that to my daughter and granddaughter. It hadn't worked yet, but I'm working on it. [Laughter] But anyway, the whole notion here is that we—they told us when I ran—and I'll end this. I ran in 2020 saying I ran for three reasons. And you may remember, I got roundly criticized. One was that I thought it was time to restore some ethics to the politics, to—you know, to restore the soul of the country. We're a good, decent people. The American people are good, decent, honorable people. But we were—but the way things were going, it just—the way we talk to one another in politics anymore, the way things have become so polarized. And I said the second reason I was running was to deal with the issue of giving the middle class a fighting chance. Like I said earlier, I come from one of those families. We weren't poor, but we weren't—there was never anything left over at the end of the month. And you know, the idea that the trickle-down economics—and I—look, if you can make a—go make a million bucks, make a million bucks. If you can make a—$500 million, make it. Just pay your fair share as you go along. Just pay your taxes. Just pay a fair share. And so I decided I was going to end the trickle-down economics where, you know, if the—if the wealthy do well, everybody else does well. That—not a lot trickled down to my dad's kitchen table. And so I decided we're going to build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. And that way, the wealthy still do very well. I made a commitment that offended a lot of Democrats. I said, ""No—I will not raise taxes on anybody had—making less than $400,000."" So I couldn't be accused of not wanting people to be able to make money. And we have—and that's what we've done. Not a single penny of taxes have been raised by anybody making under $400,000. But, in the meantime, what's happened? We've grown the middle class. We've created 800,000 manufacturing jobs, 1.6 million—1.6 million [16 million; White House correction] new jobs—more than any President has in American history in this—in that period of time. We've moved our—[applause]. Well, thank you, but we—well, the other thing we've done is, we provided health care shouldn't be an option. You know, we—I was able to change the Affordable Care Act and another 800,000 [8 million; White House correction] people—anyway—access to insurance, access to health care. I won't go into the—and the last thing I said, which I really got clobbered by the press, as you recall—and they're good folks; they just thought I was naive, even though I've been around 270 years. [Laughter] I said, ""You know, we've got to bring the country together."" Because when I left the Senate, I was honored to the—you know, they do this ceremony. When I was Vice President, I left, and they vote and say nice things about you. Well, one of the things said was that I was able to get more done than anybody in the Senate because I had relations with Democrats and Republicans. I crossed the aisle. And so I said we've got to bring the country together. They said: ""That's naive. That used to be the case when Biden was a Senator, but he can't do it anymore."" Well, guess what, folks? We're the most diverse country in the world. Not a joke. We're the most unique country in the world—every other country is organized based on either ethnicity, geography, religion. But we're the only country based on an idea—not a joke, an idea. Only country in history. And the idea was: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, et cetera. We've never lived up to it, but we've never fully walked away from it. But what I realized was, the other guy was walking away from it—walking away from it. And so we ran, and we were told we were going to lose in 2020. You remember? Well, we won. We were told we were going to have—[applause]. Because of you. Because of you. And by the way, we're also—we were also told that what was going to happen is the—there—there was no possibility of being able to get bipartisan legislation passed. You know, remember, Trump used to always talk about all he was going to do in terms of—of the whole idea of building bridges, roads, internet, and he had Infrastructure Month every month. He didn't build a thing. [Laughter] But look what we're doing. We're rebuilding—how can you be the most powerful country in the world and have bridges that don't work, highways that don't work, people—look, the internet is as consequential to most people as the telephone used to be 50 years ago. And so the point is that we were able to put it together. I'm optimistic. I'm optimistic. We've done—I'm going to say something that's going to sound awful. The press is here, so I'm going to say it in front of them. I think most of the political historians say I've gotten more done than most Presidents have since Franklin Roosevelt in terms of fundamental changes and—and by the way, in the process, all this is going on, we saved money. We lowered the deficit. We gave people more jobs. It didn't do any of the things—remember, it was going to be this hard landing, and nothing was going to happen? Well, guess what? I was worried—today, the Wall Street Journal talks about how—Wall Street Journal economists think I am better at—than Trump in terms of the economy. That's worrisome to me. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, think about it. Because when you give people a fighting chance, everybody does better. Not a joke. And the last example I'll give you is, I've been fighting for years on—taking on Big Pharma. I can put you in Air Force One with me as we flew up in, and if you have a prescription by an American drug company, I can fly you to Toronto or to Berlin or to London or to Rome; get you the same exact prescription from the same exact company for somewhere between 40- to 60-percent less. For example, I was able to reduce the price of insulin for people who have serious problems they have—need on a regular basis were $400 a month to $35 a month. I—[applause]. But here's the deal. Here's the deal. The reason I was able to do that—guess what? The fact of the matter is, they still make three and a—350-percent profit. It cost them 10 bucks to make it. It cost them 10 bucks to make it. And so my point is, what that did was—everybody said, ""Biden is, you know, this big liberal,"" or are—you know, ""This is going to cost us money""—guess what? It saved you, the taxpayer, $1.7 billion. And somebody—— Audience member. Thank you! The President. No, I'm—[applause]. No, I'm serious. Because Medicare didn't have to pay these prices; they can negotiate it. My generic point is that all the stuff we've done—like, for example, I make no apologies: I'm the most pro-labor President in American history. I mean factually. I know how to say the world—word ""union."" But here's the deal. I had the Treasury Department do a study: With an increase in union membership and the contracts like I—I know I got a lot of criticism because I walked the picket line with UAW; the only President ever has done that. Well, guess what? What happened is, I asked them to do a study: What's the impact on the rest of the workers in America? Everybody does better. Everybody—[applause]. No, no, I'm serious. Got another $50 billion in investment from chips manufacturers. We invented those chips. In everything from a telephone to a rocket. And guess what? They're all somewhere else. They were being—they exported those jobs because they've got cheaper labor. And we have what they call—anyway. So I went to South—I went to South Korea to get them to come back. And guess what? We got the—all these companies to come back. Not come back—reinvest in America. I asked Samsung why are they going to invest $20 billion in Western Pennsylvania. And they said, ""Simple reason""—that they are. ""One, you have the safest place in the world to invest. And two, you have the best workers in the world."" Everybody thinks, you know, you show up and you want to be an electrician, you say, ""I want to be an electrician."" You go, like—5-years apprenticeship. It's like going back to college. My generic point is, I'm convinced to give people a chance—give people a chance. Everybody deserves—no guarantees. Just a chance. And that's what we've done. And we're—and that's why I'm running again, to finish this job. There's more to do. I know I'm only 41. [Laughter] Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. God love you. You're like my sister. [Laughter] Anyway. But, folks, this is a—this is an important moment. And I hope you—I used to—always when I finished my—I got elected—I was, for the longest time, I was too young, because I was the second youngest man ever elected to the United States Senate. And anyway, and now I'm too old. But I know, hopefully, with a little bit of age comes a little bit of wisdom. And I—hopefully that—in this moment, I think the alternative is not much of an alternative. And I do think ethics matter. I do think decency matters. I do think we should reflect what the American—we're an optimistic, we're a decent, we're an honorable country. And I give you my word—last thing I'll say—I am—never been more optimistic about America's possibilities than I am today. Every one of those foreign leaders you saw on television—the 32 members of NATO—I'm going to say something outrageous: I'm the guy that pulled NATO together. I'm—literally, I was able to expand it. Every time I leave them, they go, ""You've got to win."" [Laughter] Because the other guy wants to—says—anyway. But we have a—we have real opportunities—real opportunities. And so we've got to finish the job. And I promise you, I am—I'm okay. Thank you. I thought I'd walk around the tables and—[inaudible]. Is that okay? Audience members. Yeah!","","",""

And by the way, I don't call it ""labor."" It's simple: unions. I say the word. I can't tell you how much this means to me. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And, folks, look, I'm here for one reason: Kamala and I won Michigan in 2020 because of you, and we're going to win it again in 2024. And here's how we're going to do it. We're going to stand up for women in America. We're going to protect contraception. We're going to protect IVF, and we're going to restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. I mean it. We're going to protect the right to vote. And we're going to fight for Medicare and Social Security, not cut it like the other guy wants to do. And I'm going to—I promise you I'm going to keep lowering the cost of prescription drugs in America. We're going to keep expanding health care. No matter how many times Trump and his MAGA Republicans come after the Affordable Care Act, we will stop them and stop them and stop them. I mean it. Too many people are depending on it. We're going to protect our children. We're going to get weapons of war off the street. We're going to ban assault weapons. Folks, look, more children are killed by the—a bullet than any other reason in America. They die for that—from more than anything else, any disease, any problem. It's sick. And, above all else, we're going to stand up for our Constitution and save our democracy. Folks, you probably noticed, there's been a lot of speculation lately: ""What's Joe Biden going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out?"" Well, here's what I say: I am running, and we're going to win. I'm not going to change that. In fact, just today, the Marist Poll released a national poll that has me beating Trump 50 to 48. I don't know where all this drop-off supposedly took place. There's so much of my narrative—my campaign is falling apart, they say. I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party, the only Democrat or Republican who has beaten Donald Trump ever. And I'm going to beat him again. I know him. Donald Trump is a loser. Audience members. Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! The President. Well, folks—folks, I'm the nominee. I'm the nominee of this party because 14 million Democrats like you voted for me in the primaries. You made me the nominee, no one else—not the press, not the pundits, not the insiders, not donors. You, the voters—you decided. No one else. And I'm not going anywhere. I learned a long time ago that when you get knocked down, you get back up. I've led this Nation from the depths of the pandemic to the strongest economy literally in the world. And we're not done yet. We're not done yet. We have to finish the job and do what I'm—[inaudible]—that's how we're going to do. [Laughter] Folks, let me tell you something about Donald Trump and his friends down in Mar-a-Lago. Audience members. Boo! The President. Wall Street didn't build this country. You did. The working people and the middle class built this country. And unions built the middle class. That's a fact. [Applause] That's a fact. Folks, I'm proud to say I'm the first and only President in American history to walk a picket line. Because I know labor—when labor does well, everybody does well. That's not hyperbole. I came to Michigan to walk that picket line. I stood shoulder to shoulder with United Auto Workers, the greatest autoworkers in the world. And I want you to know, I promise you—I give you my word as a Biden—I will always have your back and—because you've always had mine. Remember what Donald Trump did when I was here walking the picket line? He gave a speech at a nonunion shop. Audience members. Boo! The President. So, when Trump comes here to tell you how great he is for the auto industry, remember this: When Trump was President, we lost 86,000 jobs in union. And I created 275,000 auto jobs in America. In fact, what's been true in the auto industry is true all over America. Since I became President, we've created nearly 16 million new jobs nationwide, 390,000 of those jobs right here in Michigan. We've created 800,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide, including 24,000 in Michigan. Unemployment is down to 4 percent, and record lows for more than 2 years. Historic-low unemployment for Hispanics, Black, Asian American, including here in Michigan. Look, just yesterday it was reported, because of my economic plan, inflation is down again—again. Overall prices fell last month. Core inflation is the lowest it's been in 3 years. Prices are falling for cars, appliances, airfares. Grocery prices have fallen since the start of this year. We've got more to do. We're going to keep working to take corporate greed—take it on. You know, since the pandemic, corporations have doubled their profits. I understand corporations. I come from the corporate capital of the world: Delaware. They have more corporations incorporated in my State than every other State in the Union combined. I'm not anticorporation, but I'm antigreed. That's what I'm anti. Meanwhile, Donald Trump—other than riding around in his golf cart, filling out his scorecard before he hits the ball—[laughter]—he's calling for—I'm serious, he's calling for—this is the God's truth—he's calling for a 10-percent tariff on everything we import, including fruits, vegetables, coffee, and other necessities. Audience members. Boo! The President. And the leading economists in this country tell us that his plan would cost working families $2,500 a year in a new tax. That—no, that's a fact. Not a joke. Folks, the vast majority agree, our economy is moving in the right direction. Jobs are up, wages are up, the economy continues to grow, and inflation is down. And I love telling Trump this, even though I don't own any stock: The stock market is a historic high. It closed at over 40,000, Donald. People are getting a little worried that so many moderate and mainstream Republican—well, they're not all Republican—mainstream economists support me. Look, there are more people that have more money in their 401(k)s than they ever did before. But, folks, you don't have to take my word for it. Sixteen Nobel laureates in economics agree: Under my economic plan, you know, they say we're going to continue to grow and keep inflation down. They say that Trump's plan would make—put the economy in a recession. Because when—16 Nobel laureates last week say he would put us in recession and inflation would soar. Folks, look, in fact, I should—I guess I should worry, but the new Wall Street Journal survey of economists says inflation would be worse under Trump. That's the Wall Street Journal. Great paper. Usually not supportive of me. [Laughter] Do you really want to go back to the chaos of Donald Trump as President—— Audience members. No! The President. ——back when the United States lost 3 million jobs? Audience members. No! The President. And by the way—by the way, Donald Trump is the only President in American history other than Herbert Hoover who lost more jobs than he had when he came in. That's why I call him Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. Remember the days when people were dying—literally dying—and we were pushing on the COVID effort? Well, guess what? He told us: ""You don't worry about the COVID. It's not that bad. Just in bleach—just inject some""—really—""inject bleach in your arm."" I think he missed; he hit his head. [Laughter] Look, remember when Trump was transgressing peaceful protests across the White House lawn who were marching for justice. Look, folks, it just—it's—you know, if it wasn't so serious, it would all—almost be like a made-up novel, what happened. Now, I'm not complaining; I'm just saying. You may have noticed that since the debate, the press—and they're good guys and women up there—they've been hammering me. I make a lot of mistakes. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, no, I—— Audience members. Boo! The President. No, no, no. It's okay. It's—they've been hammering me because I sometimes confuse names. I say that's Charlie instead of Bill. But guess what? Donald Trump has gotten a free pass. He hadn't done a damn thing until, like, a couple of days ago. He'd been riding around on his golf course—golf cart in his course, filling out his scorecard before he picks up his club. [Laughter] Rambling about—think of what he sees—been talking about. Hannibal Lecter, he says, is a nice guy. [Laughter] How Trump would rather be electrocuted than eaten by shark. You know, that whole thing? You remember that? Poor Donald. He can't even watch TV this week because it's ""Shark Week."" [Laughter] And by the way, on a more serious note, I had 32 members of the—and from—mostly from Europe, but 32 members of NATO in Washington. And by the way—and the press has covered this. They give me credit for strengthening NATO, expanding NATO, making it what it is. But look, this is deadly earnest. When that butcher, Putin, who I know and have known for a long time—— Audience members. Boo! The President. When he invaded Ukraine, here's what Trump said—I'm not making this up either. He called him a ""genius"" and said it was ""wonderful."" Audience members. Boo! The President. What in the hell is going on? But people would rather talk about how I mix up names. I guess they don't remember that Trump called Nikki Haley ""Nancy Pelosi."" [Laughter] Well, no—no more. Donald, no more free passes. Today we're going to shine a spotlight on Donald Trump. We're going to do what the press, so far, hasn't, but I think they're going to soon. We're going to say who he is, what he intends to do. Folks, Donald Trump is a—Donald Trump is a convicted criminal. He is convicted. Audience members. Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! The President. He was convicted by—he was convicted by a jury of his peers of 34 felonies for paying hush money to a porn star and hiding it from voters in 2016. Donald Trump was found liable for sexual assault by a judge who told us not to be fooled by Trump's brushing it off. Here is what the judge wrote, quote—the judge in that case wrote, ""Mr. Trump attempt to minimize sexual abuse finding it frivolous."" ""Mr. Trump 'raped' her""—no, let me—this is the judge's language, not mine—""'raped' her, as many people understand the word 'rape.'"" Folks, Donald Trump is a business fraud. He lost his license to do business in New York State—has been fined over $400 million for giving false information to banks. And he's still facing charges for mishandling classified information, which is a criminal offense. He's still facing charges for his role in January 6, trying to overthrow the outcome of the 2020 election. He is still facing charges in Georgia for election interference. Remember his phone call? ""I just need 11,780 votes."" Name me another President who has done any of that. Look, if you want to know how bad a businessman Trump really is, just think about this: He inherited millions of dollars only to squander it. He's filed bankruptcy six times. He even went—he went bankrupt—even went bankrupt running a casino. I didn't think that was possible. Audience member. The house always wins! The President. Doesn't the house always win in a casino? Most importantly, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Trump is a threat to this Nation. He led a violent mob on January 6 to overturn the 2020 election, to hold onto power. That I—the election that I won by 7 million votes. Folks, and by the way, he made these claims about stealing an election. Guess what? Audience member. Free, free Palestine! Free, free Palestine! The President. What happened was—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. [Inaudible] By the—by the way, no—you—you—I know. Audience member. Hey, hey, what do you say? These babies are dying every day! Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Folks—folks—look, give me—give me 1 second. Folks, look, I understand her passion. I understand her passion. That's why I put together a detailed plan that the United Nations accepted, that the Israelis accepted, that the Palestinians have accepted to end this war. This war must end. It must end. Well, look, we saw with our own eyes—we saw how he sent thousands of people to attack the Capitol—Trump. We saw the police being attacked; the Capitol being ransacked; the mob hunting for the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi; gallows set up to hang Vice President Pence. And we saw—we saw—it here in Michigan in a stark attack on your State capitol, a horrendous plot to kidnap your Governor; protests surround—protesters surrounding your home—her home—the home of your secretary of state for simply doing her job. She is here tonight. Madam Secretary, I'm proud of you. Where are you, Madam Secretary? That's why I bestowed on the Secretary the Presidential Citizens Medal, one of the Nation's highest honors in defense of democracy. Folks, and now Trump wants to pardon those January 6 insurrectionists. Audience members. Boo! The President. It's outrageous. It's wrong. And I will never let it happen. No President has ever attempted to do what Trump tried to do. No President. But Trump is even more dangerous now. No, I'm serious. He's unhinged. He snapped. And he refuses this time around—he refuses this time around to say he'll accept the election—of this election—the results. Can you imagine that? Look, he says, if he loses, there will be a ""bloodbath"" when he loses. And the United States Supreme Court said there's virtually no limit on the power of a President. Trump said if he wins, he'll be a dictator on day one. He means it, folks. We're not going to let that happen. Audience members. No! The President. Over my dead body will it happen. Folks, I don't want to complicate it, but just look at his right-wing Project 2025. Audience members. Boo! The President. Oh, but it's really focused on—you heard about it? Audience members. Yes! The President. It's a blueprint for the second Trump term that every American should read and understand. Now, of course, Trump is lying about it now. He said—tries to distance himself, just like he's trying to distance himself from overturning Roe v. Wade, because he knows how toxic it is. But we're not going to let that happen. And the press—and the press shouldn't either. Project 2025 is run and paid for by Trump people: his top policy people, his campaign press secretary, his personal bag man in the White House, the biggest funders, and more. It was a project built for Trump. Folks, Project 2025 is the biggest attack on our system of government and our personal freedom that has ever been proposed in the history of this country. And here's the nightmare—it would—what it would unleash. Trump Project 2025 will criminalize the shipping of abortion medications—medication anywhere—anywhere to deny contraceptive covers [coverage; White House correction], allow a ban nationwide. That's what Project 2024 is—2024 is—25 is calling about. Project 2025 will deploy the Department of Justice to prosecute Trump's energy—Trump's enemies, and that's a real deal. Trump's enemies. Trump himself calls his campaign—the campaign—this is what he calls it, ""revenge"" and ""retribution."" That's what he said. Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, Trump's 2025 Project will eliminate the civil service. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I'm serious. Not a joke. Read it. And he will let—and it will allow him to hire tens of thousands of civil servants that are running only because they support Trump. They have to take a loyalty oath to Trump beforehand. Audience members. Boo! The President. Folks, that's not the United States of America. Trump's 2025 Project will cut Social Security and Medicare, rip away protections for preexisting health conditions. It will eliminate $35-a-month cap on insulin, allowing drug companies to jack up the prices—back up to 400 bucks a month; stop Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices. And by the way, I got criticized for taking on Medicare—I mean, on—taking on the drug companies and the pharma for that. Well—well it's—— Audience member. That's all right. The President. Damn right, it's all right. [Laughter] But, by the way, you know what it did? When I won, it cut the Federal budget by $160 billion. Trump's Project 2025 would eliminate the Department—he wants to eliminate the Department of Education. Not a joke. Audience members. Boo! The President. He wants to cut school lunch programs. Audience members. Boo! The President. I know this almost sounds like a joke, but it's real. He wants to eliminate Head Start for low-income children. Audience members. Boo! The President. His project will allow him—employers to stop paying overtime for hourly workers, but give—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——but give the very wealthy another massive tax cut. The tax cut he's proposed is for $5 trillion over the next 10 years. Folks, Project 2025—you're going to let him round up over 10 million people in America and put them in detention camps. You heard him say it. You heard him say what he wants to do. That's what he says he is going to do. Ripping them away from their homes, their schools because Trump calls them ""animals"" who ""poison the blood"" of America. Look, folks, there's only one reason only some of Trump's plan of 2025—it goes on for 900 pages. We've never seen anything like this. And it's not a joke. It's time for us to stop treating politics like entertainment and reality TV. Another 4 years of Donald Trump is deadly serious—deadly serious. His proposals are deadly serious. America needs to wake up and realize that Trump and his MAGA Republicans—what they're trying to do. We're going to join them, we're going to engage them, and we're going to stop them. And, folks, we all know it's not enough just to be against something; we have to be for something. So I am—today, I'm going to start by laying out the first hundred days in my second term. And here it is. The first bill I'm going to introduce will restore Roe v. Wade to make it the law of the land. I will sign the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom To Vote Act. And we're not only going to stop Trump and the MAGA Republicans from cutting Social Security and Medicare, we'll expand and strengthen Social Security and Medicare. And here's how we're going to do it. The press always ask, ""How?"" Listen, press. By making the rich pay their fair share of Social Security. And we're going to end medical debt. By that I mean, we've already made sure medical debt can no longer be put on your credit report. We can wipe out it—medical debt for pennies on the dollar. We're going to raise the Federal minimum wage. We're going to pass the PRO Act, ending union busting once and for all. And I'm going to ban assault weapons again. I did it once, and I'm going to do it again. We're going to keep leading the world—and we are—on climate and clean energy. When I signed the American Rescue Plan, the law expanded childcare tax credit to cut child poverty in half in America, and it did. Republicans let it expire. I'm going to make the childcare tax cut permanent. And by the way, it increases economic growth; it doesn't increase the deficit. People can work when you have a child. No, I'm serious. That's the deal. We capped the cost of insulin for seniors at 35 bucks—totaling cost. And no senior, beginning on 2025, is going to have to pay more than $2,000 a year for all their prescription drugs, including cancer drugs that are $10-, $12-, $14,000 year. And my second term, here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to make that same plan available for every single American. Again, saving the Federal Government hundreds of billions of dollars over time. We're going to make housing more affordable. That means taking on corporate greed and getting the rents down. We're going to build 2 million housing units and cap rent increases at 5 percent a year so corporate landlords can no longer gouge everyone like they're doing. We can do this. We're going to end Trump's tax cuts for the very wealthy and the corporations to make the Tax Code fair. I kept my commitment. I thought—I think a lot of you thought, ""Why is Biden doing what he said?"" Which is, I said, ""No one making less than $400,000 will pay a penny more in Federal taxes."" I don't know many people making $400,000. In my neighborhood, no one did. [Laughter] But I wanted to be clear that I wasn't going to be taxing anyone who was a working man or even close to it. But here is what we're going to do. We're going to make billionaires—billionaires—we have a thousand of them in America since the pandemic—pay a minimum of income—a minimum tax of 25 percent. You know what—by the way, do you know what they pay now? A billionaire's Federal tax is 8.2 percent. Audience members. Boo! The President. Not a joke. I'm not making this up. Because no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a firefighter, or a nurse. It's ridiculous. That one thing alone would generate $500 billion in revenue over the next 10 years, allowing us to do more for childcare, eldercare, bring down the Federal deficit, and do so much more. We're going to continue to secure the southern border. Look, after Trump killed the bipartisan effort we put together that a lot of Republicans supported as well, he called—he got on the phone, and he called all his friends because he said, ""If in fact you vote for it, it—it's going to be a win for Biden and loss for me, so don't do it."" Well, the Republican Party—— Audience members. Boo! The President. I've got to—have to admit to you, I was a little surprised the Republican Party walked away from it. So that's when I took executive action. I said—and since I did the border, encounters have gone down over 50 percent. And we're going to keep it going down, fixing our legal immigration and creating pathways for citizenship for ""Dreamers."" I made it clear, there are over a half a million spouses in America—married to Americans—who don't have a green card after 10 years here. They're now going to get their green card. Folks, the days of—failed trickle-down economics are over. My first hundred days of a second term is going to continue to be all about working people of this Nation. Unlike Donald Trump, I don't work for Big Oil. I don't work for Big Pharma. I don't work for the National Rifle Association. I work for you, the American people. Everyone. Look—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. What's America all about? Everyone in America is entitled to a fair shot—just a fair—no guarantee, a fair shot. But in America, we're going to leave no one behind and give everybody a fair shot. That's all they are. Folks, let me close with this. I know I look 40 years old—[laughter]—but I'm a little bit older. Hopefully, with age comes a little wisdom. And here's what I know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how and I've demonstrated how to do this job. And I don't—I know Americans want a President, not a dictator. And I also know no self-respecting American President would ever, ever, ever be Putin's puppy like this guy is. [Laughter] That's what he is. You know, Americans want to protect their freedom not give them up. I know what America stands for. We stand for the proposition that all—all—people are created equal and deserve an equal—[applause]. No, I mean it. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it though. And I'll be damned if I'm going to let Donald Trump walk this Nation from—away from it. Folks, this race is about your family. It's about your freedom. It's about democracy. Are you with me? Are we going to stop Donald Trump? Let's get this done. And let's remember who we are. We are the United States of America and there's nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","","",""

Biden, Jr.","July 07, 2024","Remarks at a Campaign Event in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania","Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Remarks at a Campaign Event in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373374",12525,"Felicia Spriggs-Wilkerson. My name is Felicia Spriggs-Wilkerson. I am the president of AFSCME's Local 3130, as well as the District Council 90 Advisory Board for AFSCME. It is my honor and my privilege to ask you all to help me welcome the President of the United States, President Joe Biden. The President. My name is Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter] And I feel like—every time I come back to Pennsylvania, I feel like I'm coming home. No, no—I was born and mostly raised in—— [At this point, the President briefly imitated a regional accent.] Scranton—as we say in Scranton. And I married a Philly girl, Jilly from Philly. But I tell you what, once—after our—I went to a local parade—a little parade in little place called Hockessin, Delaware, a little—right on the Pennsylvania border—after our son had passed. And I was sitting at home thinking he—it was his favorite parade. So I decided just to go into it. And I was walking along in this small community, and three guys—four guys about your size came running up to me. I thought the Secret Service was going to kill them. And they came running up—swear to God, a true story—they said: ""Joe, what's all this damn stuff about Pennsylvania? You're from Delaware."" [Laughter] ""You're from Delaware."" Yes, but it never gets—it never leaves you. It never—anyway, thank you, thank you. Look, folks, I make no apologies for being the most pro-union President in American history. No, I mean it. You know, after we—anyway, you know, I've—you've heard me say it before, but I'll say it again and again and again: The middle class built this country, not Wall Street. And guess what? Unions built the middle class. And I know how to say ""union."" It's amazing how a lot of people talk about ""labor""—unions. Unions. AFSCME have been with me my entire career, and I've been with you my entire career. And by the way, I know there's a lot—you know, we have a lot to talk about. I'm not going to make a campaign speech now, but just to say two things. One: One of the things we're going to change in the second term is, we're going to have a fairer tax system. We got it a little fairer. We made those 55 companies that didn't pay a penny in taxes and made $40 billion—we made them pay, but it's only 23 percent, so they're not paying—or 15 percent. They're not paying enough. You've got—out there—literally, you've got a thousand billionaires in America—up to a thousand billionaires. You know what their average tax rate is? Eight-point-three percent. Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, I'll—no, what—but here's the point I want to make to you all. This is very serious. I'm not joking about this one. The fact of the matter is, Trump wants to give another—and he has said it—a $5 trillion tax cut over the next 5 years. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I'm not joking. You know what we're going to do? We're going to stop it, and we're going to spend that money on childcare. We're spending that money—[applause]. No, I mean it. We're spending that money on eldercare. We're going to—look, folks, all of those things that people gave me credit for—or the critics said ""Biden is just a big spender"" and—first of all, we ended with actually a little bit of a surplus. But guess what? That other guy had the largest deficit any President ever had in history. But here's the deal. I asked the—I asked the Treasury Department to do a study: Was all my pro-union stuff and organizing and marching and being on picket lines with you all—is that good or bad for the economy? When unions do well, the entire economy and everybody's—nonunion does better—everybody. So I really mean it. I came to thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We're the most powerful country in the world. We have the best economy in the world. But now we've got to make sure that we start taking care of the families like Jill and I grew up. Jill is from Willow Grove, Pennsylvania; I'm from Wilmington area. And I tell you what, we lived in three—she lived in a—she had five sisters in a four-bedroom, split-level house. I was—I had four kids in my family in a three-bedroom house with a grandpop living with us—small house. I wonder—I've wondered how my mom and dad did it, now looking at it. But the point is, you know, at the end of the month, my dad used to say: ""Joey, a paycheck's about a lot—worth a lot more than the amount of money. I—it's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about whether you have any—you're able to look your kid in the eye at the end of the month and say, 'Honey, we're going to be okay. We're'—and mean it."" Folks, there's a lot of people still struggling, because since the—since we ended the pandemic—well, I'll be very blunt: Since I ended the pandemic—he didn't—[applause]—corporate profits have doubled—doubled. And we've got to do something about it. And one of the things—you know, when we did—when I first—the first bill that I got passed, and they—we—I didn't have a Congress to continue it—I made sure that we had payments for childcare, per child. And guess what? Based on income. And guess what? We cut child poverty in half—in half—[applause]—and the economy grew. When we have childcare, guess what? Mom or Dad can go to work and earn money. It grows the economy. This isn't a waste of money. It's growing the economy. Well, I'm getting too wrapped up here. Anyway—[laughter]—there's a lot we can do. I go all the way back to McEntee when I—since I was—oh, you think I'm kidding? I'm not. [Laughter] I got elected in large part because of AFSCME in my home State—in the home State of Delaware. So we've got a lot to do, folks, but we can do it. We're on the cusp of getting so much done. I really mean it. And with your help—I know we have your help. With my help, helping—us working together, we're going to get a hell of a lot done for the American people. And we're going to make sure these things are—so, anyway, I guess—if I stand here long enough, all those folks in the back are going to die of sunstroke. [Laughter] Well, I'm not going to do that. Anyway, I tell you what, I've got a young guy with me who is—if you're ever in a foxhole, you want him with you: Senator Fetterman. Senator John K. Fetterman. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to say: How many union members here? The sacred—sacred—union way of life. There's one President that's going to protect that, and he's stood up for it every time, right there. And now, look at the size of this crowd. Look at the size of this crowd. That's not some kind of narrative that you not see enough of that. And now I'm about to point to the only person that's ever kicked Trump's ass in an election right now. [Sen. Fetterman gestured toward the President.] I hope the media is hearing that—remind you of that. Humiliated Trump. Broke him. And he had to lie about it. And his minions had to repeat that. And they all got charged and convicted of that. Fox had to cut a check for $800 million trying to talk about those kinds of lies. I am proud to stand right here next to this President right now. He's my President. He's your President. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Sen. Fetterman. Yes. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Sen. Fetterman. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Yes, let's talk about 4 years ago. We were all—you know, we were hoarding toilet paper. [Laughter] We'd all be on some big Zoom right now, but we're right here right now. Remember what that was like. Let's just—how great was I 2, 4 years ago? You want 4 years—you know, you want 4 more years of that mess and that kind of chaos? Audience members. No! Sen. Fetterman. Now a man is obsessed with revenge. You want that? You know what his plan 2025 is? His plan is retirement. And he's going to put him down, just like he's did it before in 2020, and he's going to do this right now. Joe Biden has held every line—every line—two wars, a pandemic. Look at our economy. All of those experts were going to say, ""It's going to be a recession,"" and ""Oh, no. We don't know."" But it's like, now our economy is the envy of the world right now. A couple days ago, 200,000 new jobs right now. This guy right here. Like I said, I am proud to be here, and I want to thank all of you for showing up. And this is the conversation I'm proud to have between now and November, because that's our guy. And that's the way it's going to stay. The President. Madeleine, you've got—— Representative Madeleine C. Dean. Mr. President. Mr. President, it is so hard to follow you, and then you put me behind Senator Fetterman? [Laughter] Are you kidding me? Hi, everybody. My name is Madeleine Dean. I'm a Member of Congress—[applause]—Member of Congress from the Philly suburbs. I see some of my friends here. I have friends here because I had the honor of serving here for 6½ years in the Pennsylvania House, in the seat, I might remind you, that was Josh Shapiro's. Lucky me. But now I have been 5½ years in Congress. I have had the opportunity, the honor—the historic honor of serving alongside this President for 3½ of those years. What an amazing run. Take a look at what has been accomplished under this President. And I can tell you, close up and personally, the contrast couldn't be greater. I served 2 years before you became President with the former guy. They were very dark days in our country. We cannot go back. It would only be worse. And I always say to people: We have two people who would be the nominees for President. We've seen them both perform as President. One with utter integrity, intellect, experience, wisdom, a heart bigger than all of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. And the other, so, so seeded with corruption, self-serving, corrosiveness, criminality—self-serving to the core, doesn't know service at all—he knows only service to himself. So take a look at the records. I know you all know it. But this man knows exactly what he's doing. And we cannot risk going back. I see signs back here about our freedoms, our democracy. Remember, all of the freedoms you're fighting for, that we are fighting for stem from our democracy. I was there on January the 6th. I was taken out in a gas mask. I didn't know where we were going or who would be harmed or killed. I watched as Trump supporters, incited by that President, went to the Capitol and used Trump flags and grotesquely used American flags to beat police officers, to maim them. Five then died. Democracy is on the line. There's no greater patriot than Joe Biden to serve us. Thank you. The President. Now, since I'm in Harrisburg, the location of the Governor, we've got a Lieutenant Governor here. Gov. Lieutenant Governor Austin A. Davis of Pennsylvania. Thank you, Mr. President. Are you all fired up? Are you ready to reelect Joe Biden? Look, I'm going to make it real clear and simple. There's so many young people that I see in the audience here today. And before we came out, I was telling the President, about 10 months ago, I was honored to become a dad for the first time. Look, that's what this election is about. This election is about making sure we have a President who cares about each and every one of us, making sure that we have a President who believes in the promise of America, and making sure that we have a President who will always stand up for our fundamental rights and our fundamental freedoms. I want my daughter to have the same rights that her mother came into the world with and have the same ability to live the American dream. I trust Joe Biden with my daughter's future. So what we need to do as Democrats, we need to not worry; we need to work. It's time for us to get on the doors. And you know what's going to happen if we do that? We're going to win. We're going to reelect Joe Biden. We're going to send Patty Kim to the State Senate. We're going to expand a Democratic majority in the statehouse. And we're going to deliver for working class people. The President. Thank you, thank you. Folks, with your permission, I'm going to find out whether you have any ice cream. [Laughter] You know, isn't it really dull when you have a President who is known for two things: Ray-Ban sunglasses and chocolate chip ice cream? [Laughter] But look, folks, I want to say hi to all of you. We're not going to make this any more formal than we already have. We're going to put the mike down, unless one of you steal it and want to make speech. And with that, why don't we get something to eat. Okay? Thank you.","","",""

Biden, Jr.","July 07, 2024","Remarks at a Campaign Event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Remarks at a Campaign Event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373516",9716,"The President. Hello, hello, hello. I came to say thank you. I think we have 38 headquarters in this State. It's everybody's State. It's also my home State. I'm from Scranton. [Laughter] When coal died, we moved with my dad—when my dad had moved from Claymont, Delaware—from southern Delaware—northern Delaware to Scranton, and we came back home. But look, even when I was running for Senate and each time I ran, quite frankly—not a joke—Philadelphia, in particular, got me across the line. [Applause] No, I'm not joking. Well, no, I mean it—I mean it, seriously, organizationally and in terms of fundraising, the whole deal. But look, here's the deal. This election is going to be about blocking, tackling—simple, basic politics. Simple. It's going to be a matter of how many signs we get out, how many doors we knock on, how many calls we make, and how many requests we answer. Because, look, the reason I got into this is the same reason you did. You know, they used to have a philosophy in our Government for the longest time, and it—including with some Democrats, of trickle-down economics. If the very wealthy did really well, everybody else would do well, and it would trickle down. Well, my dad was a hard-working guy. My dad was a fine man. Not a whole, whole lot ever trickled down to his kitchen table. So, when I got elected—I mean it sincerely from the bottom of my heart—I decided—and I tried this when I was a Senator, kept pushing it as well, but now it's policy—that we're going to build this economy from the middle out and the bottom up, because if the middle class does well and ordinary people have a shot, everything works. We have the strongest economy in the world. We've got more we have to do though. We have to let people know, first and foremost, we really care about them. I mean, that's basic stuff. That's basic stuff. We've been drawing crowds that have been really big crowds ever since the debate. Not joking. Even that night of the debate, we had great crowds afterwards. And so things are moving. They're moving hard. And look, the other thing is that people want to know you care. They want to know we care. There's nothing letting someone know you care like knocking on the door and saying: ""My name is so-and-so. I'm here for Joe Biden. Is there anything—what do you need? What do you need?"" And so there's three things we're working on—three things we're working on to make sure ordinary people get a clear shot. You know, since the election—I'm going to—I'm not going to make this a speech. I'm going to—I promise, John. [Laughter] By the way, I've got John Fetterman. I don't need much else. But, all kidding aside, you know—what—there's three things people—the economy nationwide is great. The economy internationally is great. We're in the strongest economy in the world. We're leading the world. But ordinary folks, like where I come from in Claymont, Delaware, and Scranton in the three-bedroom, split-level home I grew up in—we weren't poor, but it was always a struggle. My dad used to say: ""A job is about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'It's going to be okay.'"" Everybody—everybody—deserves a shot. And by the way, we're making progress. Inflation is down. We're moving. But here's what ordinary people—and I'm curious what you're hearing when you knocking those doors—they're saying: ""Look, grocery prices are too high. They used to—they're—I just can't afford it."" Well, there's a lot of corporate greed going on. Audience member. That's right. The President. No, I'm—and by the way, I come from the corporate State of the world: Delaware. Okay? More corporations incorporated in my State than every other State in the Union combined. Okay? So I'm not anticorporation, I'm just about fairness. So three things I'm going to do: I'm going to change the tax system. The wealthy are going to have to start paying their fair share. You know, I did it—remember we had that whole thing about those 55 corporations that paid zero in taxes? Well, they saw they couldn't do anything about it. Well, I did get something done about it. I—but I was only able to raise their tax to 15 percent. You'd all trade for that price—right?—15 percent. But we raised more money that paid for all the programs we have. We've actually cut the deficit. The things we're doing, and he wants to take away, like health care and what we're trying to do in terms of—what we are doing in terms of taking on Big Pharma. Big Pharma is in position where they're charging exorbitant prices. If you know anybody that has diabetes, ask them what it's like now paying 35 instead of 400 bucks a month. The bottom line is, there's nothing we can't do if we focus on who the hell we are. We're the United States of America. I really mean this. Work together, there's not a damn thing we can't do. We've got a hell of a team running this time out. I just spoke to Dwight. He's going to be running statewide again. And Pennsylvania is a critically important State—critically important State. And so I'm counting on you. I'm heading from here to Harrisburg. By the way, no one has ever had as much organized labor support as I have. I'm going— [applause]—and they're full-bore in: operating engineers. [Applause] No, I'm serious. I'm the most pro-union Senator [President; White House correction] in the history of the United States of America. I make no damn apologies for it, because when they do well, everybody does well. But anyway, look, I just want to say thank you, thank you, thank you. It's all about touching people. It's all about talking, all about finding what's on their minds. That's the thing I miss most. I love the Secret Service, by the way. [Laughter] They're great. No, no, no. No, they really are. But I'm not able to do what I used to do. I'd be riding down the street in this—in the vehicle before and see a bunch of kids in the schoolyard waving, I'd stop and get out. Realistically, I can't do that anymore. It's just too dangerous what's going on out there. But the point is, we—I just—the thing I miss most is just looking people in the eye. If you want to know what someone is thinking, you say: ""My name is Joe Biden. What's on your mind, Nicole?"" And by the way—and by the way, you can tell by looking in their eyes. So, folks, let them know we care. You have all the details, all the—and by the way—— Audience member. We need Dark Brandon back. [Laughter] Audience member. He's got his glasses. Audience member. Oh, the glasses! The President. I've got my glasses and—well, I tell you what: Dark Brandon is coming back. He's here. And guess what? The next 120-something days or so, they're going to get a real good look at who Donald Trump is. Anyway, thank you, thank you, thank. Maybe I can just talk to you. Thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. By the way, folks, if you're in a—if you're ever in a foxhole, the guy you want next to you is this guy here, John. Senator John K. Fetterman. There is only one person in this room that kicked Trump's ass in an election. There is only one person in this State that has kicked Trump's ass in an election. There is only one person in the country that's ever kicked Trump's ass in an election, and that is your President. That's our President. That's your President. That's my President. Four years ago—4 years ago—we were hoarding toilet paper. We would all be doing this in Zoom right now. You know? Or if it wasn't for Joe Biden, Trump would be at the White House, and he'd be campaigning for his third term. You know, think about that—— Audience member. [Inaudible]—already installed himself there. Sen. Fetterman. Yes. It's just like, Joe Biden has held every line that he needed to do, and he has. I—am—I—you know, I know what it's like to have a rough debate, and I'm standing right here, you know, as your Senator. An amazing President—and I want to just say how I'm so proud I am to stand with the President, and I know all of you is in again. And we already knew this was going to be close. We knew is going to be close in 2016, going to be close in 2020. Twenty twenty-four, nothing has changed other than it's going to be close. And again, I want to remind everybody: There is only one guy that has ever beaten Trump, and he's going to do it twice and put him down for go. The President. And by the way, she may not be as tall. [Laughter] She—she may not be as powerful looking. But she's Irish, and so am I. [Laughter] And she's tough. Madeleine Dean. Representative Madeleine C. Dean. Oh, I am delighted to be here with the President of the United States, Pennsylvania's own Joseph R. Biden. I can't top what our beautiful introduction said, Noëlle—is it Noëlle? Noëlle, I can't top what you said. I really can't top what he said. But what I can tell you is my own experience. I have had the privilege of serving alongside this President for 3½ years. And before you became President, I had the turmoil of serving in Congress with the former guy. We know the contrast. This is not a guessing game. We know there's one man of character, integrity, and accomplishment. And we know there's one man who was a crook, a criminal, corrosive to our democracy. I was there on January 6 and had to be taken out of the Capitol in a gas mask to I don't know where as American citizens, incited by a President, came and attacked the Capitol, using the American flag, beating police officers. Democracy is on the line. There's one man who understands it. It's Joe Biden. The President. God love you. I just wanted to come out and say hi to all of you. Okay? Come on.","","",""

Hey, folks, look, first of all, I can't tell you how much I appreciate you being here. No, I really mean it. I really mean it. You know, when you're way ahead and everything is working, everybody is there. But when you take a hit and you got knocked down, you get back up, and you're with us, that's a big deal. That's a big deal. Number one. Number two, I—you know—I think we all agree. I mean what I said: We cannot let Trump win. Audience members. No! The President. No, I mean, that's not hyperbole. We can't. This is the most dangerous election in American history. And we beat him once, and I'm confident we can beat him again. Number one. We've got—we've got a long way to in this election. Over 125 days, I think—something like that. So there's a lot to get done. A lot to get done. And I wasn't joking. I got raised politically by—when I first got elected, there was an accident in my family. I was about to be sworn in, then I got a phone call saying my wife and daughter had just been killed in a car accident and my two sons weren't going to make it. And so I decided I wasn't going to stay. But one of the guys who came to see me talked me into staying. He said, ""Just stay—just stay 6 months."" [Laughter] Six months. [Laughter] It was Gaylord Nelson. He stepped in. He put together a group of Senators, including some Republicans. He said, ""Just come and stay, help us out."" And they turned out—saved my sanity and saved my life. And they were—no, I really mean it. So, you know, you—all of you have had somebody there when things were tough, that have reached out, and it makes a difference. Well, quite—that's how I collectively think of all of you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I really—[applause]. And everybody under the age of 12 who had to be here because their parents took them—[laughter]—I owe you. What's your name? Audience member. Leo. The President. Leo, my name is Joe. How old are you? Audience member. Eleven. The President. Eleven. When I was 11, I came up to about your shoulders. [Laughter] Well, it's good to see you.

[Laughter] You know what I mean? Anyway. But thank you very much. I'm go—I have to—not have to—I'm about to do an interview with George Stephanopoulos. It's going to be televised. And he's waiting in another room somewhere. I'm not sure where. [Laughter] So I'm going to have to head off. But I wish I could say—— Audience member. Thank you, Joe! The President. Thank you. Just go ahead and snap. Come here. All right. And by the way, tell the press how much you like Wisconsin. Audience member. Go win, Joe! The President. We're going to give it hell.

And I've got to thank somebody. Gaylord Nelson, I'm back. He first introduced me to Wisconsin a long time ago when I was a kid. I'm only 40 now, but I was a kid back then. Sabrina, thank you for the introduction—for the introduction and for the—volunteering for our campaign. And a special thanks to one of the best Governors that I've ever worked with in my life, Tony Evers. We've got a former Governor, Jim Doyle—[inaudible]. Madison—Rhodes—[applause]—the mayor, the mayor of this city. Look, we've got a guy who has a tough time winning elections. He only gets 70 percent of the vote. Congressman Mark Pocan. There he is. There's so many local leaders here today, including the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Ben Wikler. Ben, where are you? [Applause] Hello, Ben. Folks, did you have a good Fourth of July? By the way, if you wondered whether Trump has it all together, did you ever hear how he explained the Fourth of July when he was President? No, I'm serious. This is true. His explanation of how America won the Revolutionary War. I'm not making this up. He said in his Fourth of July speech 5 years ago—he said George Washington's army won the Revolution by taking control the airports from the British. [Laughter] [At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.] They talk about me misspeaking. [Laughter] Airports and the British in 1776? [Laughter] It's true. He is a stable genius, this man. [Laughter] My friends, I'm in Wisconsin for one reason: because we're going to win Wisconsin again. [Applause] We're going to win it. And let me tell you how we're going to do it. You know the reason. We're going to do it because of you all in this room, to start with. Well, we're going to stand up for women in America. We're going to restore Roe v. Wade to the law of the land. We're going to stand up for the right to vote again. And we're going to fight for Medicare and Social Security and childcare, eldercare, paid leave. All which grows economies. We're going to keep lowering the cost of prescription drugs and expand health care for everyone, not just—[applause]. Look, we're going to protect our children from—getting weapons of war off our streets. That's what we're going to do. The idea that more children die from gunshot wounds in America is so wrong. It's sick. It really is sick. We're going to keep confronting climate change. And more—[applause]. And most important, we're going to save our democracy. Now—[applause]. Now, you probably heard, we had a little debate last week. I can't say it was my best performance. Audience member. We love you, Joe! Audience member. That's okay, that's okay. The President. But ever since then, there's been a lot of speculation. ""What's Joe going to do? Is he going to stay in the race?"" Audience members. Yeah! The President. ""Is he going to drop out? What's he going to do?"" Well, here's my answer: I am running and going to win again. [Applause] Because—because—— Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. We're going to go. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Folks, I'm the sitting President of the United States of America in no small part because of you. Not—that's not a joke. In 2020, you came through for me. I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. I'm the nominee of this party because millions of Democrats like you just voted for me in primaries all across America. And you voted for me to be your nominee. No one else. You, the votes—the voters did that. And despite—despite—that some folks don't seem to care who you voted for—well, guess what? They're trying to push me out of the race. Audience member. No! The President. Well, let me say this as clearly as I can: I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump. I will beat him again in 2020 [2024; White House correction]. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Well, by the way, we're going to do it again in 2024. I learned long ago: When you get knocked down, you get back up. Audience members. Get back up! Get back up! Get back up! The President. And I'm let—I'm not letting one 90-minute debate wipe out 3½ years of work. As the Governor said, I've led this Nation from the depths of pandemic—from the depths of a pandemic to the strongest economy in the world. And that's literally true. And I and you are not finished yet. Now you probably also noticed a lot of discussion about my age. I know I look 40. [Laughter] I keep seeing all those stories about I'm being too old. Let me say something—— Audience members. Wisdom! Wisdom! The President. ——I was too old—I wasn't too old to—— Audience member. Experience! The President. I wasn't too old to create over 15 million new jobs; to make sure 21 million Americans are insured under the Affordable Care Act; to beat Big Pharma—the first one ever to do that—and lower the cost of insulin to $35 for seniors. Was I too old to relieve student debt for nearly 5 million Americans and grow the economy? Too old to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court of the United States of America? To sign the Respect for Marriage Act? Was I too old to sign the most significant gun safety law in 30 years? To pass the biggest climate bill in the history of the world—not here, in the history of the world? But then, my critics say: ""Sure, but—you did all that. But that was in the past. What about now?"" Well, how about the 200,000 jobs we announced yesterday? So let me ask you: What do you think? Do you think I'm too old to restore Roe v. Wade to the law of the land? Audience members. No! The President. Do you think I'm too old to ban assault weapons again? Audience members. No! The President. To protect Social Security and Medicare? Audience members. No! The President. To get childcare, eldercare for working families who needed it—nation? Audience members. No! The President. To make billionaires finally start to pay something beyond 8.2 percent of the tax rate? Audience members. No! The President. Let me ask you: Do you think I'm too old to beat Donald Trump? Audience members. No! The President. I can hardly wait. Anyway. [Laughter] Folks, let's focus on what really matters. We're running against the biggest liar and the biggest threat—no, really—the biggest liar and the biggest threat to our democracy in American history. That's not hyperbole. Audience member. Preach, brother! The President. Over 150 Presidential historians voted him the worst President in American history. No, the worst. As I've said before, he has the morals of an alley cat. [Laughter] He lies about the economy he created. The truth: He's one of only two American Presidents who left office with fewer jobs than when he came into office. You know who the other one was? Herbert Hoover. Audience members. Boo! The President. Fact. That's why I call him Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. [Laughter] He lies about the pandemic he totally botched. The truth is over a million people went on to die. He told us what? To inject bleach in our arm. It wasn't serious. He lied about how great he was for veterans in his administration. The truth: He called veterans who gave their lives serving America—and I was just in Normandy, on the beaches of Normandy, and all through that area. And he said—I have trouble saying this because my son died as a consequence of Iraq. They gave their lives, and he called them, quote, ""suckers"" and ""losers."" Audience members. Boo! The President. By the way, I'll be damned—I'm glad I wasn't with him because I'll be damned to let him talk about my son that way. Audience member. That's right! The President. But how do we know he said—how do we know he said this, that I'm not making this up? A four-star Marine general—his own former Chief of Staff—was with him, and he told us that's what he said. But he's not the only former Trump official warning us about how bad Trump is, including the former Secretaries of Defense and even his own Vice President. They refused to endorse him. It says a lot about who Trump is and says a lot about what he isn't. By the way, I couldn't ponder—I guess I shouldn't say it—by the way, I couldn't be prouder to have your support and the support of our great Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris. Trump is a convicted felon found guilty—34 felonies—— Audience member. Lock him up! The President. ——trying to hide hush money payments to a porn star. Another jury found Trump sexually assaulted a woman in a public place. And he's been fined $90 million for defaming her—$90 million. [Inaudible]—about 20 times, but I don't know. This so-called great businessman owes over $400 million in fines after being convicted in New York State of business fraud—already convicted. Fined $400 million. Donald Trump isn't just a convicted criminal, he's a one-man crime wave. But Trump's biggest lie of all is that he had nothing to do with the insurrection of January 6. We all saw it with our own eyes. We saw when he sent thousands to attack the Capitol. We saw police being attacked, the Capitol being ransacked, the mob hunting for Nancy Pelosi, gallows set up to hang Mike Pence. Let me ask you something. After what Trump did on January 6, why would anyone ever let him be near the Oval Office again? Folks, the issue in this election is: What kind of America do we want to be? What kind of America do we want to be? Do we want to be a country of anger, revenge, and retribution or country of hope and optimism of possibilities, as we've always been? I want a country where women have a right to make their own health care decisions. Trump wants an America where abortion is banned and women are punished. I want an America where health care is a right, not a privilege. Trump wants to throw tens of millions of people who couldn't get insurance any other way than Obamacare off of Obamacare. Audience members. Boo! The President. I want an America where the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Trump wants to give the very wealthy an additional—last time out when he was President, he gave them a $2 trillion dollar tax cut, creating the largest deficit any President has in one term. Now he has announced he wants another $5 billion—trillion—trillion, not billion—$5 trillion tax cut after already leaving the largest deficit. Audience members. Boo! The President. Just—I mean, it's hard to make this up. [Laughter] I want to protect Social Security and Medicare. He wants to cut Social Security and Medicare so he can cut taxes for the very wealthy. I want to ban assault weapons and require universal background checks. You all heard him promise the NRA—he promised the National Rifle Association, ""I will do nothing about guns."" That's what he said. ""I will do nothing about guns."" And he means it. I want January 6 insurrectionists to serve their full prison terms. Trump wants to pardon them. Folks, you can't be pro-insurrectionist and pro-America at the same time. This is so damn serious. You can't love your country only when you win. Look, you've been standing a long time. Let me close with this. Ultimately, the American Presidency is about character, the character of the President who holds the job. Because with the immunity he's talking to—the Supreme Court just talked about, it gets down to that. It gets down to that. It's about honesty. It's about the President's decency, integrity. Do they respect people or do they incite violence and hate? Can they honor their oath to the Constitution and uphold their oath of office? Well, I don't think it's an exaggeration to suggest Trump has failed on every one of these character tests—every one. And what's worse, the Supreme Court has just ruled that there are virtually no limits on the power of the Presidency. I know it sounds bizarre, but that's what they ruled. A frightening decision. According to an extreme majority of the Supreme Court, a President is now above the law. We just celebrated the Fourth of July saying we will not be ruled by a king. And this Supreme Court he appointed approved this new law. Audience member. Expand the Court! The President. It's a dangerous precedent, especially if Donald Trump is returned to the Presidency. Just think about it. The second term—this next term, whomever is the President is going to appoint at least two new appointees. A second Trump term, where there are no limits. Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor warned us about that in her dissent in that case. Here's what she said. She noted that based on the majority's decision, Trump can take out his opponents—I mean physically take them out; take bribes; lead a coup; and be immune to ever being held accountable for it if he did it while he was President, according to the Supreme Court. Audience members. Boo! The President. I mean, where the hell are we? So he really could become a dictator that he promised to be on day one. Audience member. Not on our watch. The President. For over two centuries, America has been a free, democratic nation. And I'll be damned if in the year 2024, just 2 years before our 250th anniversary as a nation, I'll let Donald Trump take this away. Folks, this is not hyperbole. This race is about our freedom. It's about our democracy. It's about the very soul of America. Audience members. Yes! The President. Are we prepared to fight for that? Audience members. Yes! The President. I know I am, and I will. And, folks, I have never been more optimistic about America's future, because the American people are decent, good, honorable. We just have to remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America. I mean it. Think about it. Think about it in literal terms. And there's nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we stand together. So let's stand together, win this election, and exile Donald Trump politically. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. I'm going to come to the overflow room. [The President left the podium and greeted audience members. He then spoke as follows.] Thank you. I won't forget this. God love you.","","",""

Biden, Jr.","June 28, 2024","Remarks at a Campaign Rally in Raleigh, North Carolina","Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Remarks at a Campaign Rally in Raleigh, North Carolina Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373124",15829,"The President. Hello, hello, hello. Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, North Carolina! And I'll get in trouble with my mom looking down in Heaven if I don't say please excuse my back, I apologize. [At this point, the President addressed audience members standing behind the podium.] [Inaudible] It's good knowing you—it's good knowing you have my back. Eric, thank you for that introduction. We had a wonderful time spending time with your sons Christian and Carter. They're going to grow up to be incredible young men. You would have been really impressed the way they talked about their dad, how informed they were about what was going on. I was truly impressed. And I ate two hamburgers. [Laughter] And a special thanks to Roy and Kristin Cooper. Roy, you've been a great Governor, which makes it all the more important that North Carolina elect a great Governor to replace you, Josh Stein. And when I'm reelected again with your help, I want you to know that I'm not promising not to take Roy away from North Carolina. Whether he'll come or not, I don't know. And thanks to all the State and local leaders here today and the great musicians and entertainers who performed earlier. Folks, let me tell you why I'm here in North Carolina. I'm here for one—— Audience member. [Inaudible]—war in Gaza. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. That's okay. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. That's okay. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. I'm here in North Carolina for one reason: Because I intend to win this State in November, and we're going to see that. I think we are. And Roy is right. We win here, we win the election. And here's how we're going to do it. We're going to stand up for the women of America. We're going to restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. We're going to stand up for the right to vote. And we're going to stand up for Medicare and Social Security. And we're going to fight for childcare, paid leave, and eldercare. And we're going to keep lowering the cost of prescription drugs, not just for seniors, but for every single American. We're going to keep protecting the Affordable Care Act, which is why more than 40 million Americans have health insurance today that didn't before. We're going to protect our children and get the weapons of war off our streets. We're going to provide clean drinking water, affordable high-speed internet, quality education for every child in America. We're going to secure our border and protect legal immigration. And unlike the other guy, we're going to stand up to dictators like Putin, because—America bows to no one—no one—no one ever. Folks—and we're going to keep dealing with the climate crisis. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Look, and more than—and more than anything, we're going to preserve, protect, and defend our democracy. Because more than anything else, that is what is at stake in America this election—your freedom, your democracy. America itself is at stake. Now, folks, I don't know what you did last night, but I spent 90 stages—90 minutes on a stage debating the guy who has the morals of an alley cat. [Laughter] Did you see Trump last night? My guess he set—and I mean this sincerely—a new record for the most lies told in a single debate. He lied about the great economy he created. He lied about the pandemic he botched, killing millions of people. He closed businesses. He closed schools. Losing their homes—people all over this country. America was flat on its back. So I told Trump that he was just one of two Presidents in American history who left office with fewer jobs than he started. Herbert Hoover was the other one. [Laughter] That's why I call him Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. And then he lied about how great he was for veterans. Audience members. Boo! The President. But then I told him how he had called a veteran who had given their lives in the country in World War I—he refused to go to the gravesites—he called them ""suckers"" and ""losers."" Audience members. Boo! The President. He tried to deny it. But let me ask you, are you going to believe a four-star Marine general, his own former Chief of Staff, John Kelly, who said he said that or the disgraced, defeated, and lying Donald Trump? My son was one of those people—not in World War I, but in the—— Folks, look, how about the fact that 44—— Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Four more years! Four more year! Four more years! The President. How about the fact—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. That's okay. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. How about the fact that 40 out of his 44 top advisers, including the Vice President, aren't supporting him this time around? The people who know him best—40 of them said, ""I will not support the man I worked for this time around."" It tells you a lot about—the person who knows him. Look, he lied about how great he was on crime. I had to remind him that he oversaw a record increase of murder rates in 2020. And, on my watch, violent crime has hit a 50-year low. There's more to do, but it's a 50-year low. And then, I pointed out that the only convicted criminal on the stage last night was Donald Trump. When I've thought about his 34 felony convictions, his sexual assault on a woman in a public place, his being fined $400 million for business fraud, I thought to myself, ""Donald Trump isn't just a convicted felon. Donald Trump is a one-man crime wave."" And he's got more trials—he's got more trials coming up. Audience members. Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! The President. Well, the time for that—[laughter]. Audience members. Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! The President. Look, the thing that bothers me maybe most about him: He has no respect for women or the law. He doesn't. And then, his biggest lie. He lied about how he had nothing to do with the insurrection of January the 6th. Audience members. Boo! The President. We all saw with our own eyes. We watched it on television. We saw thousands of insurrectionists attack the Capitol. We saw police being attacked, the Capitol being ransacked, the mob hunting for Speaker Pelosi, gallows literally set up for Mike Pence. And then, he told them as he sat in the dining room—the one dining—the private dining one door off my Oval Office. He sat there for 3 hours watching the TV. He did not a single thing to stop it—nothing, nothing at all. And now—— Audience members. Boo! The President. And now, he wants to pardon all those convicted criminals. Audience members. Boo! The President. But, folks, for all his lies, we did learn some—we learned some important truths about Donald Trump last night. We learned he's still proud of being the person who killed Roe v. Wade. We learned—— Audience members. Boo! The President. No. We learned he's still proud about the pain and cruelty he's inflicted on America's women. Audience members. Boo! The President. We learned he still believes that politicians, not doctors and women, should make decisions about a woman's health. Audience members. Boo! The President. We learned that if he's elected again and the MAGA Republicans pass a national ban on abortion, he will sign it. Audience members. Boo! The President. Donald Trump says he thinks Roe v.—overturning Roe v. Wade was a beautiful thing. Audience members. Boo! The President. I think it was a nightmare. No, I really mean it. A nightmare. And I made it clear again last night that if you elect me and Kamala and you give us a Democratic Congress, we will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. He continued to lie. He said I quadrupled taxes—where the hell has he been?—[laughter]—which is a simple lie. I didn't raise the tax on anyone in America that made less than $400,000 a year, and I won't in my second term either. We learned that Trump—who had the largest deficit of any President in 4 years because of the $2 trillion tax cut to the superwealthy—we learned that Trump wants to give another giant tax cut for the very wealthy and the biggest corporations. This time, $5 trillion—not a joke—$5 trillion. To pay for it, he's going to cut Medicare and Social Security. He'll cut health care. They'll do it all, with millions of working and middle class Americans all paying for another tax cut for the very wealthy. Then, to add insult to injury, he wants to raise taxes on the average family $2,500 a year. What amounts to a new 10-percent sales tax on all products imported in America—that's his new plan—for food, coffee, candy bars, and so much more. It's going to raise the tax on the average family $2,500 a year. And most dangerously, though, we learned that Donald Trump will not respect this year's election outcome. He's still not—he rejected the last time out. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, think about it. Every court in the land ruled that it was a fair election. He's still denying it, still telling lies. Three times, Trump was asked last night by the moderators: Would he respect the election results if he lost this time? Three times, he refused to answer. Three times. Folks, Donald Trump refused to accept the results in 2020, and we all saw what happened on January the 6th. It's a direct consequence of that. It was an international embarrassment. By the way, as I go these international meetings—I know every major world leader—I literally—because I've been around, as you might have noticed. [Laughter] But they ask, ""Does he really mean this?"" ""Is that—was this real?"" It caused a constitutional crisis and international embarrassment. Now, Trump is making it clear that if he doesn't win this time, there will be, in his words, ""bloodshed""—blood—— Audience members. Boo! The President. No President has ever said anything like that. No President. His words, not mine. Are we going to let Donald Trump attack our democracy again? Audience members. No! The President. I don't think so. Folks—— Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Folks, we've come a long way. We've come a long way from the mess that Donald Trump left us. We came out of the pandemic. We're a long way from where—Donald Trump telling us to inject bleach in our skin, that COVID is not that dangerous. Today, we have the strongest economy in the world without exception—15 million new jobs; 800,000 manufacturing jobs; unemployment under 4 percent for a record 2 years in a row—historic Black and Hispanic unemployment down; historic creation of small businesses—Black and all communities across the Nation, particularly in rural areas; historic economic growth; inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3, and it's still going down. I know we have more to do to get prices down. We have to take on corporate greed. They're making twice the profit they were before the pandemic. We've got to make housing more affordable, provide childcare, make the Tax Code fair. Sixteen Nobel winners of the economic—Nobel Prize have looked at my economy—economic plan. This week, they've issued a report. And on Trump's plan. Here's what they concluded. They said that my plan would continue to grow the economy and bring down inflation. Sixteen Nobel laureates. And that Trump's plan would send the Nation into recession and inflation soaring through the roof. Audience members. Boo! The President. But don't take my word for it. Folks, let me close with this. I know I'm not a young man—[laughter]—to state the obvious. Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. Well, I know. Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. Well—I don't—— Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. Folks, I don't walk as easy as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know—I know—I know right from wrong. And I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done. And I know like millions of Americans know: When you get knocked down, you get back up. I know what it took to take our economy from the depths of pandemic to where it is today: the strongest economy in the world. I know what it will take to bring this economy to everybody. I know what it will take to rally the world to stand up against Putin and defend freedom, not yield to him. And I know what it will take to keep the world safe and free for the years ahead. Folks, I give you my word as a Biden. I would not be running again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job. Because, quite frankly, the stakes are too high. Audience members. Yes, you can! Yes, you can! Yes, you can! The President. The stakes are too high. Audience members. Yes, you can! Yes, you can! Yes, you can! The President. Donald Trump—Donald Trump is a genuine threat to this Nation. Audience members. Yes! The President. He is a threat to our freedom. Audience members. Yes! The President. He is a threat to our democracy. Audience members. Yes! The President. He's literally a threat for everything America stands for. Audience members. Yes! The President. Look, he doesn't understand what I think all of you do. America is the finest, the most unique nation in the world. We're the only nation in the world—and I mean this sincerely. It's a fact statement, not a hyperbolic statement. It's fact. We're the only nation in the world built on an idea. All other nations are built on ethnicity, geography, and other—religion. But we're built on an idea that we're all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We've never fully lived up, but I'll be damned in the year 2024, just 2 years—just 2 years before the 250th anniversary of our Declaration of Independence that I'll let Donald Trump walk away from it. I give you my word—I give you my word as a Biden. We're still a nation—I believe our civilization believes in honesty, in decency, and treating people with respect. I still believe we're a nation that gives everyone a fair shot and leaves nobody behind. We are still a nation that gives hate no safe harbor. And we're still the beacon to the world. We can never give up what makes America America. Donald Trump is motivated by revenge and retribution. Well, revenge and retribution never built a damn thing. You and I, we Americans are a nation of hope, optimism, and possibilities. That's what always built America, and that's going to continue to build America today. The choice in this election is simple. Donald Trump will restore our democracy; I will defend it. [Applause] So, folks, are you with me? Donald Trump is the first President I've heard of that stood up there and running for President having been one—one term, saying, ""America is a failing nation."" Where the hell does he think he is? Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I'm serious. A failing—I don't know a President who wouldn't trade places with America in a heartbeat. He's dead wrong. America is not a losing nation. America is winning. As I stand here today, I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future in my whole career. We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. And there is—there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity—nothing—when we act together. Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! The President. You've got it. Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! The President. So may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Let's go get them, North Carolina. [The President gestured toward the First Lady.] She finally did marry me.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374963",67711,"[music: Lee Greenwood, ""God Bless the USA""] TRUMP: Wow. CROWD: USA! USA! USA! TRUMP: Thank you very much everybody, and hello Philadelphia. I went to school in Philadelphia. I'll say—[cheers and applause] I like it. And we won it twice in actuality, and we won it all the times in the primers. We had great success here. We're going to have the biggest year we ever had. This is going to be a big one. And hello also to this great place. I love this place. I've gone to a couple of games. You used to have good teams. Do you still have good teams here? I don't know. A little bit. A little bit. You had a great coach actually. Hello, Pennsylvania. It's good to be with you. [cheers and applause] Good to be with you. I'm thrilled to be back in the birthplace of American freedom with thousands and thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots, which is what you are. With your help, five months from now, we're going to win this Commonwealth. We're going to evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House, and we are going to make America great again. Less than four years ago, our border was secure, inflation was nowhere to be seen. The world was at peace. They respected your country and America was strong like never before, all because you finally had a President who put America first. I put America first. [cheers and applause] Now under crooked Joe Biden, the worst President in the history of our country, the world is in flames. Our border is overrun. Inflation is raging. Crime is out of control. Europe is in chaos. The Middle East is exploding. Iran is emboldened. China is on the march. And this horrible, horrible President is dragging us toward World War III. We're going to be in World War III soon. I see every move he's making. Remember, Trump was right about everything. You see the cap. Trump was right. We're racing a clock. We're racing a clock. We'll be in World War III with this guy. That's why this November, the people of Pennsylvania are going to tell crooked Joe Biden, you are fired. Get out. Get out. You're fired. [cheers and applause] Few communities have suffered more under the Biden regime than Philadelphia. Under crooked Joe, the city of brotherly love is being ravaged by bloodshed and crime. Two weeks ago, nine people were shot in a single weekend, including three teenagers, so seriously hurt. Murders in Philadelphia reached their highest level in six decades. Retail theft in Philly, I spent so much time here, is up 135% since I left office. The convenience stores are closing down left and right. The pharmacies have to lock up the soap. There's soap. You want to buy a little bar of soap, you got to go through a big deal, open up the glass, open up the steel. They can't keep a bar of soap. People walk in, they just take it. You can't buy toothpaste. You can't buy a toothbrush. You want a toothbrush, it takes you 45 minutes. Meanwhile, the schools are ranked fourth from the bottom in the entire nation and crooked Joe has no plan to improve them, none whatsoever. By the way, we're moving the Department of Education back to the states and we're gonna do it quickly. And you know some of our states are going to do a fantastic job with running education. If you think about it, we're—we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world, and we're at the bottom of every list. So as I used to say about a group that likes me very much, what the hell do you have to lose? Right? We might as well do it. And we'll be able to cut education in half and get much better education. Some of the states, I could name them right now, will have the best education anywhere in the world. Some won't do as well. There are a couple of states, like I would say Gavin Newscum [sic], will not do well. Under the Trump administration, we're going to bring law and order and safety back to our streets. We are going to bring success back to our schools. We're going to bring prosperity back to our forgotten communities, and we are going to liberate our once great cities and make Philadelphia better and more beautiful than ever before. [cheers and applause] But saving this once incredible place begins with stopping the killing and the crime that's setting records every single week. Unbelievably, crooked Joe Biden is going around trying to claim that crime is down. He says crime is down. Crime is so much up. First of all, we have a new form of crime. It's called the Biden Migrant crime, right? Biden Migrant. [booing] And all these millions of people that have come in here, they're just getting warmed up because they wanted to feel it out. They didn't know what the words politically correct mean because in their country, if they did what they do over here, they'd be shot and killed instantly. They can't believe what's happening over here. So it's only going to get worse. It's going to get worse and worse right up to the election. And after the election and January 20th, it's going to get real good. Gonna get real good. Gonna go fast. We're going to give immunity to our police. So if they arrest somebody or if they speak a little bit harshly, they won't be discarded. They won't be destroyed. They won't be thrown in jail because they raise their voice to a criminal. They won't lose their family, they won't lose their home, they won't lose their pension. But the FBI crime statistics Biden is pushing are fake. They're fake just like everything else in this administration. Now he's even saying that all his mishaps were fake. They say the fake news covered him in a fake manner. [booing] That's a lot of fake news. That's a lot of fake news back there. [booing] All we want them to do is be honest because they're all going out of business. Nobody believes them anymore. And it didn't help when they went along with the Biden scam. What is he called? What does he call it? You know what he calls it? So they get him in about nine different positions. I mean even normal positions, although I assume he's been in some very bad ones. But they get him in all these horrible compromising posts and then they say he wasn't—It really wasn't that way, I was told. Then everybody sends in—They all have cameras. See, every one of you has a camera. If I blow it up here though, actually, they take a perfect, brilliant, beautiful statement that I make, I go for two hours without teleprompters, and if I say one word slightly out, they say ""He's cognitively impaired."" Whereas Biden can run into walls. He can fall off the stage. He can fall up the stairs, he falls up. [cheers and applause] He can turn around. Listen to this. From 20,000 feet, a paratrooper is landing right in front of him. Everybody, all the foreign leaders there watching, and he turns around to look at a tree, right? No. And then they say it was fake. He was fine. And then the press goes along with it. They go along with it. They say, ""Isn't it terrible the way they cover him?"" No, no, he's terrible. The worst President in history by far, and we have to get him out or this country is not going to survive another year. According to the much better National Crime Victimization survey, there has actually been a 43 percent increase in violent crime since I left office, including 58% increase in rapes and 89% increase in aggravated assaults and a 56% increase in robberies. Other than that, I think we're doing quite well, don't you? But with your vote, Joe Biden's, wave of bedlam and death and terror will begin to recede the moment I take the oath of office January 20th. First, I will stand with the heroes of law enforcement. We will give our police officers the respect and protection, resources and support that they need to drive down your crime to zero. Second, we will surge federal law enforcement resources to the places that need them most. There are certain places like places that I know very well here that are just absolutely out of control. I mean, if you walk down certain streets here, you have a 50/50 chance of not ever seeing your home again. That's not too good. Instead of throwing Christians in jail, as Biden has done, we are going to crack down on the gangs, the drug dealers, human traffickers, and criminal cartels. Third, we're going to stand up to the out of control, Soros-backed DAs like Philadelphia's despicable Marxist prosecutor, Larry Krasner. How did he get in? Krasner has the blood of countless men, women, children on his hands, including thousands of African American citizens because he refuses to prosecute people. They don't refuse to prosecute me. I got more prosecutions than any human being. I've got more than the great Alphonse Capone. You ever hear of Scarface? Oh, my parents. My parents are looking down, how did this happen to my son? You know how it happened? I won an election that I wasn't supposed to win. I then did better the second time by a lot. We did much better—For those of you in the fake news, we did much better the second time than we did the first, not even a contest. In fact, we got the most votes for a sitting President in the history of our country. And then we were told, ""Oh, but you just missed it. You just lost."" No, no, we can't let this happen. And I'll tell you what I have never seen, and we had a great 2016, we had an even better 2020. There has never been enthusiasm like I'm seeing right now. There's never been. Never been. [cheers and applause] Thank you, thank you, thank you. Wow. CROWD: USA! USA! USA! TRUMP: Isn't that great? They've got the best seat in the house, because if there's a star in the crowd, you know their cameras, the cameras on them like the whole thing. They may be only can see the back of my head. But you know what? The cameras on them, you think you have the best seats. If there's a star in the group, they will be found by the fake news. But my administration will aggressively defend the right of every American to live in safety and at peace. We're going to have a safe country again. [cheers and applause] We're going to have a safe country again. For that same reason, we will end Biden Migrant crime. New category, it's a vicious crime. I told Dana White of UFC, I said, ""Here's what we're going to do. These are tough cookies coming into our country coming with prisons and mental institutions."" I said to Dana White UFC, he's got a big fight going on right now. He's a good friend of mine. You know what he said the other day? They said, ""Who's the toughest person you've ever met?"" He said, ""Definitely Donald Trump."" He said, Donald Trump. How about that? But I said, ""Dana, Dana, I have an idea for you to make a lot of money. You're going to go and start a new migrant fight league, migrants, only migrants. And then at the end of the year, the champion migrant is going to fight your champion. And I hate to tell you, Dana, I think the migrant might win. That's how tough they are."" These are not—This is not a normal situation. This is not, isn't it wonderful? These wonderful people. These people are drug dealers, gang members, killers in so many different ways. No. And we probably have 18 million, we'll have 20 million by the time we get this guy out of there. But we got to get him out fast. We got even bigger problems. We got to get him out fast. The biggest problem is what he's saying to Russia, China, to Kim Jong Un, North Korea. What he's saying to these countries, they're laughing at us. They can't believe this has happened to America. On day one, I will seal the border, stop the invasion, and send Joe Biden's illegal aliens the hell back home. Day after day, week after week, Joe Biden is releasing illegal criminals into our communities to rape, pillage, plunder, and to kill. And by the way, here's the only thing. He doesn't even have a clue in my opinion. These are young, smart people that happen to be fascists and communists that surround—They surround him in the Oval Office, the beautiful resolute desk. It's been soiled. That gorgeous resolute desk. What they're doing to our country, they're destroying our country. Just this week, a twelve-year-old girl in Houston, Jocelyn Nungaray, was tied up, stripped and strangled to death after walking to a 7-Eleven, her body dumped near the side of the road in a shallow creek. Charged with Jocelyn's heinous murder are two illegal alien savages that Joe Biden recently set loose into our country. They came across our border—claiming they feared for their lives in Venezuela. They feared for their lives in Venezuela. In Venezuela, crime is down 72% because they've taken their criminals, their drug dealers, and most of the people in their jails, and they've brought them to the United States of America. [booing] So they were afraid for their lives. And think of it, they couldn't stand it. They were so afraid. I'm so afraid, Venezuela. But they waited only weeks before murdering this precious, young, beautiful girl. One of them was here for 21 days before the murder took place. Last week in New York, another illegal alien who Joe Biden set loose into our country, approached two thirteen-year-old children with a machete in broad daylight and like a scene from a horror movie, he forced them into the woods, tied them together by their wrists and raped the young girl at a park in Queens, a park that I grew up right next to, while filming it on camera. He put it on camera. He thought it was great. CROWD MEMBER: DISGUSTING! TRUMP: I used to go to that park. I'd ride my bicycle like a kid. I was a kid too. Can you believe it? I'd ride my bicycle to the park. My mother loved me. But she'd say, ""Oh, good. Now be home at a certain time."" I'd ride there. This went on for years. It was never any thought of anything happening. Now, if you go to a park near your home, you have a very good chance of never seeing your child again. This is not living in a country that we grew up in. And we're not stand for it. We're not going to stand for it. We're going to take our country back. [cheers and applause] We're going to take our country back. In Iowa this week, another illegal immigrant released by Joe Biden pled guilty to sexually assaulting a twelve-year-old girl. And last week, yet another Biden migrant was arrested for the rape and murder of Rachel, Rachel Morin. I just spoke to her mother, Patricia, Patty as they say, Patricia. Rachel was a thirty-seven-year-old Maryland mother of five whom he attacked while she was out for a run. She wanted to stay in good shape and she ends up getting killed. Police believed that the animal responsible for Rachel's killing first murdered another young woman in El Salvador. Then he fled across Joe Biden's wide open border, wide open, come on in, into the United States. We had the safest border in the history of our country. Now we have the unsafest border in the history of the world, after which he savagely attacked a nine-year-old girl at her mother in a home in Los Angeles before killing Rachel. And a lot of Rachel's family is here. I have to say that they're incredible people and we're deeply grateful for the brother, sister of Rachel. Michael Morin, Aaron Morin, Layman, would you stand up please? Please, wherever you may be. They've gone through hell. [cheers and applause] I've watched them on television. I've watched you on television, and it is a tough deal. People say time, time, time. I don't know about time. I don't know if that's the answer. Thank you very much, Michael and Aaron. We grieve Rachel's loss. We pray that God will ease your pain, and we resolve to secure our border. So this will never happen again. But you know it's going to happen again because we have a incompetent man. He's an incompetent. And he's—happens to be the President. All he has to do is say close the border. He doesn't need Congress. He goes, ""I need Congress."" I didn't have Congress. I closed the border. We had the safest border. He doesn't—All he has to do is say close the border and it's closed, that's all you have to say. He doesn't need anything from Congress. [cheers and applause] It's just unlikely that a thing like that would've happened. Thank you for being with us. CROWD: BUILD THE WALL! BUILD THE WALL! BUILD THE WALL! That's when at first, we built hundreds of miles of wall, we got Mexico to give us thousands and thousands of soldiers. And we had a great border even while we were building it. And then we were going to add 200 miles of wall and we had a rigged election take place. And what happened is when I left, all hell broke loose. And they didn't want to finish the wall, they didn't want to put up the additional wall we built. And it was all built to the highest specs of Border Patrol and ICE. And they're incredible people, by the way, Border Patrol and ICE. And instead of putting it up, which would've taken three weeks, they decided to sell it for 5 cents on the dollar. [booing] And the rest is history. When I return to the White House, we will stop the plunder, rape, slaughter and destruction of our American suburbs, cities and towns. That's what's happening. It's getting worse. It's getting worse. Worse and worse and worse by the day. We will shut down deadly sanctuary cities. I will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement. And on day one, we will begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. [cheers and applause] We have no choice. We have no choice. You know who had the largest? General Dwight D. Eisenhower when he was President. Good general, good President. Very much responsible for the interstate highway system. But he was tremendous on not wanting people to illegally flow into our country. He had the strongest deportation program. Ours will unfortunately have to be much stronger than his because he didn't have 20 million people walk in. And these are people out of the jails and out of the mental institutions. He didn't have that. He had people walk in, but they weren't the people that we're getting. And you know what? I know every one of the presidents over there. Presidents, I call them presidents, dictators, kings, queens. I know every one of them. They come from all over the world, by the way. I would do the same thing as them. They're emptying their jails and they're emptying their mental institutions. I would've done it faster than them because actually they have some people left. They're dumping them in. We're like a dumping ground for the rest of the world. And it's going to stop on January 20th at a level that you haven't seen before, it's gonna stop. [cheers and applause] I don't know if they have it. We have a card. We have a card that shows, a graph that shows—I don't even know if my guys are going to be able to find it because I didn't think I'd put it up. There it is. That's called efficiency. I didn't think they'd get that. Thank you, fellas. You're getting better. They're getting better after doing this for a few years. So if you look at that arrow on the bottom, the red arrow on the bottom, that is the week that I left office. [gestures to screen] That was the lowest level of illegal immigration in the history of our country, recorded history. And then Crooked Joe Biden came to office, crooked as a $3 bill. I used to say $2 bill, but they make $2 bills, right? He's crooked as a $3 bill. He came to office right there and there was an explosion of illegal immigration. By the way, drugs and human trafficking too. And human trafficking is mostly in women, I hate to say. You think of it as an ancient thing, but you know what made it almost as big as the drug dealing stuff? You know what it was? The internet. It's made it massive. Human trafficking in women. And there's more of it going on right now than anytime in the history of the world. And it's taken place during this horrible, pathetic President's time in office. So there it is. And that's done by the Border Patrol. That's not even done by Trump. That looks like it's done by Trump, right? That's done by the Border Patrol. That was the lowest point, that arrow. I'm very proud of that. And that supersedes a couple of things. You know what? That was in the ratings book. Because last night, and they will never tell you this because they're fake news, but last night, Rasmussen, which is, in my opinion, the most respected poll out there—Now, of course, if we get a bad one, I'll take that back. If I had a bad poll, if they come out with a bad poll in a month from now, I'll say, ""Rasmussen is terrible."" But Rasmussen, no, it is a highly respected pollster. And they came out with a poll last night that Trump is 10 points up. [cheers and applause] The fake news will not report it. The fake news will not, but they do report that we're leading in every single swing state. We're leading in Pennsylvania by a lot. [cheers and applause] No, we're doing good. Good- looking, man. Good. Thank you. I like the hat. [gestures to crowd] Thank you very much. No, we're doing good. We have some people here. Where are those people? Look at this. See those beautiful women up there? I don't know what the hell their husbands—Look at that. They come from a place called—nobody's ever heard of this—North Carolina, which we won both times and won by a lot. And in fact, we did so good we took Michael Whatley, the head of the Republican Party in North Carolina, we put him in charge. This is their 118th rally. And I don't know what the hell is happening with their husband. They're all married. They're all happily, I think, married. Are you happily married? Look at this. They come way over 100 times. And we also have front row Joes here. Look at them, front row. And they come in. And they have been, they've actually, they've been here 201 times. I can't believe I did that many. How about me? Did I do that many? I did that many? So thank you front row. And thank you very much. It's nice and you look great. You look great. Are we going to win? [cheers and applause] We don't have a choice. So we got this poll last night from Rasmussen. And it was very in depth—They also did it with Kennedy and with the other ones in there, Cornel West. He's one of my favorite candidates, Cornel West. And I like—I like her also, Jill Stein. I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100% from them. He takes 100%. Kennedy's probably 50/50, but he's a fake. He's a fake. He's a total fake. He's more liberal than Joe Biden and all of these communists that work for him. Kennedy's more liberal than all of them. He wants to be in the debate, but he's got bad numbers. You can't do that, right? I'd like to have him in the debate, actually. I'd love to have him in the debate, but he's got bad numbers. Very bad. I don't think he's going to ever make it. But Joe Biden's open border has also been a disaster for our great African American and Hispanic American population. So what's happening when millions of people flow over? The people that are most hurt are, number one, the African Americans in this country. Number 2, the Hispan—Have they taken your job yet, sir? [gestures to crowd member] CROWD MEMBER: They better not. TRUMP: They better not. I don't think they're going to get your job. I'll fight for you. They're not getting your job. Nobody's getting his job. But I will tell you, they're taking African American jobs and Hispanic American jobs. You know who else they're really affecting? The unions. And I have to tell you, we have a lot of Teamsters here. Do we have a lot of Teamsters? We have Teamsters, and I think we're doing 89% or something with the Teamsters. And they have a great leader. I hope Sean is listening right now. But we have a shot at even getting it from the top. I think we have a shot. But we have great Teamsters. They worked for me a lot in New York because they did the concrete trucks and other things, and they were incredible. But the unions are being incredibly impacted by all of these millions of people pouring into our country. But the African American population is being destroyed by Joe Biden. Remember his statement, super predator? Remember? Just don't forget the super predator statement. This guy's the biggest phony on earth. Virtually all of the net jobs created under Biden have gone to migrants. You know, almost 100% of the jobs created by Crooked Joe—What's better, Crooked Joe or Sleepy Joe? Ready? Wait. Free poll. Free poll. This is a free. You do a poll, they say, ""That'll cost $1 million."" They go out and they interview about 200 people. ""That'll be $1 million,"" right? Ready? We'll go Crooked Joe first, Sleepy Joe second. Crooked Joe first. Ready? Okay. Who likes Crooked Joe the best? [crowd cheers] Who likes Sleepy Joe the best? [crowd cheers] Crooked Joe. [crowd cheers] Sleepy Joe. [crowd cheers] Whoa. You know, that's the first time that Sleepy Joe has ever beaten Crooked Joe. [cheers and applause] It's the first. So tonight, we'll refer to him as Sleepy Joe, because right now, as you know, it's been reported that right now Crooked Joe's gone to a log cabin to study, prepare. No, he didn't. He's sleeping now because they want to get him good and strong. So a little before debate time, he gets a shot in the ass. And that's—they want to strengthen him up. So he comes out, he'll come out. Okay. I say he'll come out all jacked up, right? All jacked up. Will anybody be watching the debate on Thursday night? [cheers and applause] I'm shocked. No, I'm shocked. But they've taken so much fun out of it. There's no audience. They actually wanted us to sit down. I said, ""Look, I really want to do this thing."" You know they gave me—what happened is they gave me something that couldn't be accepted. They gave me an offer I couldn't accept, and I said, ""I'll do it."" Number one, it was CNN, fake news, right? Who hates Trump. Then it was Fake Tapper, who really hates Trump, and Dana Bash. You know, it's Dana, it's not Dana. It's Dana. You know that, right? Right? It's Dana, right? Isn't it? It's either. She doesn't even know. Then they said, think of this, but no audience. It's like death. There's two of us and two of them. It's like death. This could be the most boring, or it could be quite exciting. Who knows? I already caught them. They had a presidential commission. You remember the time where they were turning off my mic and they weren't allowed to? And they had to apologize. You know they apologized for it? Of course, that doesn't do any good. The debate's over. But we won the debate. We won just about all of those suckers, you know. We won them. How should I handle him? Should I be tough and nasty, [cheers and applause] or should I be—She say no. Should I be tough and nasty and just say, ""You're the worst President in history""? Or should I be nice and calm and let him speak? [crowd cheers] 50/50. Be tough. Be tough. So bad. So bad. But anyway, I'm sure he'll be prepared. Whatever happened to all that cocaine that was missing a month ago from the White—Whatever happened? Under the Trump administration, American workers will always come first. We will buy American, build American, and we will hire American. Biden wants—we're bringing it back. You know the auto industry, united auto, the auto workers are largely on my side. They have the worst union head in the country. This guy wants to make all electric cars. EVs, right? All EV. [booing] They don't go far. They cost too much. They're all made in China. Other than that, I think they're actually quite wonderful. But he's getting decimated by his union. He has supported Sleepy Joe. He supported him. Sleepy Joe. See, just for this, I'm going back to Crooked. I think it's more accurate. I like Crooked more. In fact, I took it away from Crooked Hillary, so I don't want to give it back to her. Because now I call her Beautiful Hillary. She's a beautiful woman. I said, ""That's the greatest day of her life when I took the branding off her."" I no longer call her. So I can't give it back. But I'm going to go Sleepy Joe, just for the rest of this particular wild— This is a wild time in Philadelphia. [cheers and applause] Now, the fake news will say, ""Trump is rambling."" No, it's genius what I'm doing up here, but nobody understands. It's genius. CROWD MEMBER: We love you Trump! TRUMP: And you know what? They know that too, but they don't admit it. You know when I showed him not being able to get off the stage? And I imitate him sometimes, you know he always goes—And then after he does that, he can never find the stairs. We've got about seven stairs on every stage. Here we have, look, 1, 2, 3, 4. [gestures to stairs] So this was built privately so we have only four. The ones built by the government, you have seven or eight. So I made the mistake of imitating him. There was a wall behind me and I just kept walking into the wall because that's what happens. And I called up my wife. You heard this story. I called up my wife and I said, ""Baby, who could do this but me?"" I had 35,000 people. You know, I had 107,000 people in New Jersey. [cheers and applause] Wildwood. Wildwood. We love Wildwood. We had 25,000 people. And that was a rainbow coalition. That was unbelievable. And there wasn't one bad word at it. There wasn't a fight. It was like a love fest. It was the most beautiful day. Everybody came together. You know why? The people of our country are looking for hope. Whether they're white, brown, black or anything else, they're looking for hope. They're tired of being called stupid people all over the world. Four years ago, we were so respected and now we're being laughed at. I took hundreds of billions of dollars away from China. One of these fakers up there said, ""He didn't take any money from China. Tariffs."" I tariffed them for hundreds of billions of dollars. He said, ""The American people paid."" No, no, no. China paid. And the American people didn't pay for it at all. They didn't pay for it. They always find a reason. They're genius in a certain way, but they're evil genius. Very bad genius. I'm nice genius. You know, I'm a nice genius. Joe Biden wants to be Pr","esident for illegal aliens, but I will be the President for law-abiding Americans of every background, every walk of life, every race, religion, color and creed. [cheers and applause] And I will tear up Joe Biden's new mass amnesty executive action on my first day back in office. So a couple of weeks ago, he signed this bull. This bullsh—[sic] I don't want to use bad language, you know? You know why, right? A man, I like, Franklin Graham, son of the great Billy Graham. And I like Franklin so much. And he wrote me a letter and he said, ""President, I love your speaking. Your ability to speak is incredible. Your storytelling is great. But it could be so much better if you didn't use foul language."" And actually, he's wrong. You know, because—But I have been working so hard, and it's not that hard. The problem is, if you don't interject every once in a while—I'm only talking about one or two times during an entire speech. These speeches go on for two hours. One or two. Franklin, give me one or two words. And if you interject, if you don't, you don't get the emphasis, but it's okay. So far, I did one today, Faith and Freedom, and I was really good. I didn't interject. Could have been better if I used a couple of bad words. When I see people start to walk out, then we'll stop, okay? But I like him. So we're trying. So I'm not going to use the word bullshit. I refuse to use it. [cheers and applause] And it's not that bad a word. I will also take immediate action to restore prosperity to every part of our land. When I left office, inflation was practically nothing. During my term, we had gasoline down to $1.87 a gallon, and at some points even less than that. And the 30-year mortgage rate was 2.7%. And then Joe Biden blew it to shreds. Biden's inflation, price hikes, and energy destruction have cost the average American family an astounding $28,000. 28,000. That's a lot of money. And with me, they actually made 16,000. That's a lot of money. You know, inflation is a disaster. It's a country-buster. It's a total country-buster. And when you look at the prices of eggs and bacon, it's gone up 100%. Much more than that in some cases. CROWD MEMBER: We can't eat anymore. TRUMP: She said, ""We can't eat anymore."" You can't. Don't ever eat again. Even I won't buy bacon anymore. It's too expensive. I said, ""I'd love to have some lovely bacon, Darling."" And she said, ""No, I'm sorry. It's too expensive."" The monthly cost of the typical mortgage has doubled under Crooked Joe Biden, but it's actually gone up much more than that. So with me, it was at around 2% interest. Now it's 10% and you can't get the money. So when you can't get the money, that means it's not 10%, right? On day one of my new administration, we will throw out Bidenomics and replace it immediately with MAGAnomics. It was just announced—this is a big announcement—it was just announced that the budget deficit is now expected to be $2 trillion. $2 trillion. That's all of this Green New Scam stuff. You know the Green New Scam? Let's build a windmill on every corner. A windmill that doesn't work. ""Darling, I'd like to watch television."" ""I'm sorry. The wind isn't blowing tonight."" Making this brutal inflation much worse than anybody ever imagined. I believe it's the worst inflation the country's ever had. To stop Bidenflation, I will end Crooked Joe's wasteful spending and rapidly terminate the Green New Scam. The Green New Scam. You know what the Green New Scam is? No water in your faucets. You ever try buying a new home and you turn on to have restrictors in there? You want to wash your hair, or you want to wash your hands, you turn on the water and it goes drip, drip. The soap, you can't get it off your hands, so you keep it running for about 10 times longer. You're trying. The worst is your hair. I have this beautiful, luxuriant hair and I put stuff on. And I put it in. Lather. I like lots of lather because I like it to come out extremely dry because it seems to be slightly thicker that way. And I lather up and then you turn on this crazy shower and the thing drip, drip. And you say, ""I'm going to be here for 45 minutes, what the?"" They put restrictors and they put them on in places like here where there's so much water, you don't know what to do with it. It's called rain. It rains a lot in certain places. But no, their idea did you see the other day? I opened it up and they closed it again. I opened it. They closed it. Washing machines to wash your dishes. There's a problem. They don't want you to have any water. They want no water. And I was with Whirlpool, the head of Whirlpool. I helped save that company because they were being attacked by China and South Korea, and I put tariffs on those machines coming in. They were dumping thousands, hundreds of thousands of machines, and the company now is a tremendous success in Ohio because of Jim Jordan, actually. The great Jim Jordan. [cheers and applause] And I said, ""What else can I do for you?"" They say, ""Sir, we're not allowed to use practically any water. I need more water."" I said, ""I'm going to give it to you."" That would took me about two seconds. But in a washing machine, they give you no water. In the shower, you have no, in the sink. The whole country is going crazy. They want you to have electric vehicles. They don't go far. They cost too much and they're made in China. That's why Shawn Fain or whatever the hell his name is going to be out of a job soon because he approved it. He's the head of the United Auto Workers. That's his name I think. Don't forget, I've done most of the speech without these stupid teleprompters. So do you think Biden could do that? I don't think so. I had a speech recently. I was in Ohio and we had 45 mile an hour winds and I get up to the stage. We had a tremendous crowd and we have a good Senate race. Bernie, Bernie Moreno is going to win I think. He's got a good chance of winning. But I went up for him. And I get up, 45, 50 miles. I never saw a wind like this in my life. If you had fake hair, don't run for politics. Just know. It was blowing. I've never seen. I even went up with a hat and the hat disappeared too. Everything disappeared. But I walked up and within about the first line, ""Ladies and gentlemen of Ohio."" And the things blew off the stage. I said, ""I am up here all by myself. I've lost my teleprompters. I've lost my hat. We got 50 mile an hour winds. People say, we shouldn't even be here, but let's go."" And I spoke for two hours and Bernie Moreno then went out and won the primary in record fashion. So is that good? I said, you think Crooked Joe could do it? I don't think so. Sleepy Joe couldn't have done it. Sleepy Joe would go to sleep. But I will repeal every disastrous Biden regulation. Cancel crooked Joe's insane electric vehicle mandate and we will ready? Drill, baby drill. [cheers and applause] Going to get your energy way down. The Pennsylvania oil and gas industries will boom like never before. So what he did is prices started going, that's what caused inflation. He started cutting all the stuff that I did, so then he immediately put it back. So they're sorta doing similar numbers. He immediately put it back. But if they ever won, you're never going to see oil again. You're never going to see a car that goes more than a very short distance, okay? You're going to be all driving trucks. If you drive a truck that's electric, you'll be stopping six times to one time. Six to one. I had the truckers in the other day. One of them said to me, Big, I said, ""How many trucks do you have?"" ""Sir, I have 28,000."" 28,000? These are the biggest truckers in the world, I think. But he said they want to make them use all electric trucks. I said, what's the problem with that? ""They don't go too far. They're too heavy."" You know, one thing nobody knew, they're so heavy, two and a half times heavier than diesel fuel, that if you make them all electric with the batteries, the heavy batteries, you'd have to build and rebuild every bridge in the country would have to be rebuilt. I said, ""Did you tell that to the people in Washington?"" Sometimes you could tell something really simple. ""Did you tell that to the people in Washington?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""What did they say?"" ""We don't care. We want you to go all electric."" They would have to stop six times from New York to Los Angeles. ""How many times do you have to stop with diesel?"" He said, ""We don't have to stop at all. We go from New York to Los Angeles."" You talk about having problems with trucks and with deliveries. He said, ""It's going to put us…"" He said, ""Sir, all of my life, for 50 years I've been building damn trucks and buying them, and every single year they got better. They got more fuel efficient, they got stronger, they got bigger, they looked better."" ""Then we started adding apartments to the cab. Some of those apartments, sir, you'd be proud to live in."" I said, ""I don't know about that."" I think so, maybe. Hey, I'd have no problem. You don't know the real Donald Trump. But he said, Every year,"" so it's such a great statement, right? ""Every single year they got better without fail."" I said, ""Who makes the best truck?"" He said, ""They all make good."" I went through every company all great. They were all very competent. He's a tough cookie too. He started with one truck and now he has 28,000 trucks. I guess he's pretty good, right? I said, ""That's a lot of work, right?"" He said, ""I worked my ass off, sir."" But he said, ""And now they want to take it all away."" Because I said, ""Every year they got better, and if they do the electric truck, we're going to go back 80 years, not 60 years. You'll go back 80 years. It'll be a disaster for the country."" I said, ""You've got to tell them that."" He said, ""We tell them. They couldn't care less. They don't even hear you."" These people are sick, and it's Biden and it's the communist that's around the desk. I'm telling you, it's Biden and the communist. We will also work to lift up Black, Hispanic and other communities in Philadelphia and all across the United States. And by the way, I have the best polling numbers that any President has had they said in 75 years. I think it's longer with Black and with Hispanic voters. We have the best polling numbers. [cheers and applause] Beautiful. Proud of you. Thank you. Thank you, Bernie. Now we have the best polling numbers. You know what? They're smart. They want jobs. They want safety. They don't want to lose their homes. Everyone said that with the Hispanic, when we put up hundreds of miles of wall, you couldn't get it from Congress because crazy Nancy Pelosi and all that put blocks on it. So I ended up taking it out of the military. I took it out of the, because I considered it an invasion. I said, ""This is an invasion of our country,"" and I built it through the military, and the military was great. The Army Corps of Engineers. I will support universal school choice. So big. It's such a big thing. I want every parent to have the right to send their child to the public, private, religious, or charter schools or homeschool as an option. We will cut taxes for working families as part of our tax cuts that I've announced, and there will be no taxes on tips. No taxes on tip. The government spends—You know, Joe Biden, they increased the rules that made it miserable. People that get some tips, they made their lives miserable. They have upped the standard and the reporting is so horrible. Everything's horrible. No taxes on tips. Every time you leave a tip for the next five months, make sure to write on the receipt. Vote Trump for no tax on tips. Okay? It's no wonder, Joe Biden and his thugs are so desperate to stop us. They know that we are the only ones who can stop them. All of their persecution is only happening because I am running for President and leading in every single poll. The rigged case in New York was not a legitimate indictment. It was a Biden indictment. He's the one that did it. This wasn't legitimate. Every single legal scholar, every one of them, you know them. I've repeated their names a hundred times, but every one of them said, ""There's no case. This is crazy what they're doing."" This was a Biden indictment. That's why when I went through that case, my poll numbers went up instead of down. That's never happened. Usually you do this. I will be leaving office, go home to my wife and my family and I will fight for my name. That's what you normally do. I said the exact opposite. "" We will fight this scum that we have to beat. We will fight them and we will win."" But it was all set up by crooked Joe and his weaponized department of justice. But since the show trial in New York, that rigged trial, where again, the greatest legal scholars, Dershowitz, Jonathan Turley, right? Gregg Jarrett, the great Mark Levin. All of them. Andy McCarthy, all of them great scholars. And then many more, many more. Not one of them said this was a case. But I had a judge who is horrendous, who was radical. He was appointed by the Democrats. He was appointed by the Democrat machine. He didn't win a vote. Normally you have to win a vote, he was appointed. And I'm not allowed to talk about it because I have a gag order. Think of it. I'm running for President of the United States. I had a very successful presidency. Even the fake news says that mostly. I had a very successful presidency. I win the nomination in record time. I don't know if you know, we won the nomination in the quickest period of time. I mean, I won the nomination like three months ago, right? Normally it would still be going on. And I have a gag order from an appointed New York City judge. I have a gag order. [booing] I'm not supposed to vote. Won't that be interesting? I get a question. ""What do you think about this or that?"" ""Sir, I'm sorry. I won't be able to answer that. I have a gag order."" Can you imagine? The President of the United States, the nominee for President of the United States, somebody that had an unbelievably successful administration, which, everybody look at us. We got the biggest tax cuts in history, the biggest regulation cuts in history, rebuilt the military, started no wars, but we finished ISIS. We beat the hell out of them. [cheers and applause] Soleimani gone. Think of it. Think of what we did. The leader of ISIS gone. All gone. That's al-Baghdadi. al- Baghdadi is gone. They're all gone. We had the safest country ever. Kim Jong Un liked Trump. He liked Trump. Got along with him good. That was going to be a nuclear war. He liked me. We had no problem. By the way, he's not happy right now. You're going to end up in a war if we don't get this thing done. It's going to happen soon. The area I'm most troubled by is the next five months, because really bad things could happen with this President. This President is a disaster for our country, and I'm very worried about the next five months. Five months is a long time. You know what five months is in this world? Five months is an eternity. It's an eternity. The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024. Not going to allow it. Every time the radical left Democrats, Marxist, communist, and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor. I'm being indicted for you. Never forget. Our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. Never. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you, and in the end, they're not after me they're after you. I just happen to be standing in their way. [cheers and applause] So you have a second very important function. We win Pennsylvania, we win the presidency. And all I can tell you is you'll be happy. You'll have a great economy. You'll have low energy costs. You'll be drilling, drilling, drill. You'll get all the way back. You're going to be at levels that you've never seen before, just like you were. They asked that question. Even the enemy said, ""I hope they don't compare the four years with Biden and the four years with Trump."" But I do that now because they said that people were happy. It's like 92% preferred my term than his term. What's good about his term? Not one thing good has happened during—What has happened? They had the worst catastrophe in history, the greatest embarrassment in the history of our country with Afghanistan. But you have to do something else. You have to elect a Senator because we can also take the Senate and if we take the Senate, the presidency, we're going to take the house, I'm sure of that. And we have a man who's a warrior, a great military person, an incredible guy, and we have to elect him as the US Senator from your state. And just so you know, Dave McCormick is a seventh generation Pennsylvanian, who grew up in Bloomsburg, went to West Point, did great there, and earned a bronze star for service in the first Gulf War, which was a victory. Dave went on to an outstanding career in business, and now he's fighting for the people of this commonwealth, and he loves this commonwealth. I mean, he's really a high quality person. I actually said, ""Dave, are you too high quality for this job?"" But I'd rather have that than the other. And honestly, you have a Senator who's been there forever. His father was there forever. He doesn't do anything. I don't think I ever met him during my years in Washington. He doesn't do anything. I don't want to use the word, he's a stiff, but he doesn't do anything. Nobody knows who he is. Nobody has any idea, and Dave McCormick is going to be an activist for you. We have so much, you have to protect your second amendment. You need help. [cheers and applause] Dave will vote to secure your borders, stand up to China, unleash incredible amounts of Pennsylvania energy. You know, you're taking a lot of money, but they want to stop it. They want to have you never take out energy out of your beautiful ground. I call it liquid gold. And he wants to stop Bidenflation, and he wants to drain the swamp. Most importantly, Dave will defeat your atrocious radical left Senator Bob Casey. Bob Casey. Look, I mean, he doesn't do anything. CROWD MEMBER: He's a scumbag! TRUMP: He's a stiff. He doesn't do anything. You ever have people like that? You meet them and they put you to sleep. You say, ""Hello, how are you?"" You fall asleep. That's Bob Casey. You fall asleep. ""Hello, Bob. How are you? I'm going to sleep, Bob."" And Bob Casey votes for sleepy Joe 98% of the time. 98. [booing] Bob Casey could have used his vote to stop Joe Biden's invasion of this country. Instead, he voted in favor of sanctuary cities. He voted against Kate's law. How do you vote against Kate's law? He voted to give illegal aliens taxpayer funded benefits. He voted against the border wall and he supports Joe Biden's bill to institute a minimum of 2 million illegal border crosses every year. He passed this thing, he signed this bill, it's the worst. It's worse than it is without it. It's crazy. And then he never did anything about it anyway, because he never does, because Joe doesn't do anything that's good. Name one thing that he's done in three and a half years that's good. [booing] Pennsylvania, you need to defeat open borders, Bob Casey, you have to get rid of your open borders and Bob Casey will fight us all the way. Well, he doesn't fight really. He doesn't. It's not like, ""Oh gee, Bob Casey."" He just goes like this. [gestures] They have guys that fight. Well, they fight for crooked elections, let's face it. But you have to elect… Look, I know David McCormick. I know him through business. He's tough as hell, and he's good. He's what you need, and really a great military personality. David McCormick, please come up. You have my total support and my total endorsement, and you got to win. Dave McCormick. Come on up, Dave. Thank you. [cheers and applause] DAVE MCCORMICK: [away from podium] Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for those kind words. Thank you. TRUMP: You're gonna do great. You go ahead, please. MCCORMICK: Thank you, Mr. President for that great, great introduction. Thank you all. I'll just say briefly, as a father of six daughters, it breaks my heart to hear about these young women that are raped and murdered by illegal migrants of Rachel's story. It's a heartbreaking thing. As a native son of Pennsylvania, it breaks my heart that 60% of Pennsylvanians are living paycheck to paycheck. Prices on the rise, 20%. As a combat veteran, it breaks my heart that we can't make our recruiting numbers, that our military is in decline and that 22 veterans a day kill themselves. We need new leadership. We need new leadership. [cheers and applause] We need a new President in the White House that's gonna get our country back on track. We need a new majority in the Senate that's going to be able to take our country in the right direction. Thank you all. Thank you, Mr. President. [cheers and applause] TRUMP: Thank you, David. And by the way, he's got a great wife who worked for me in the White House and there was nobody smarter or better. So thank you David. Very important. We're also pleased to be joined by warriors. One of the warriors is right in front of me, Congressman Dan Meuser. Congressman, where is Dan? [cheers and applause] Where is Dan? Thank you. Great, Dan. Thank you very much. Does a great job. Congressional candidate, I hear he is doing really well. Aaron Bashir. Where is he? Where is he? Oh, good-looking guy. Thank you very much, Aaron. County commissioner Tom DiBello. Tom, thank you. Thank you, Tom. Good job. We have a Philly rapper. He is going places, I'll tell you. He's got so much cash, he doesn't know what to do with it. OT7 Quanny. OT7, where are you? And I love that hat on you. That hat looks great. Thank you. Great honor to have you. And a very special thanks to the Teamsters Local 500, that helped build this beautiful rally. They were working day and night. Thank you. Thank you very much. We're also deeply honored to be joined by eight family members of American service members who lost their lives in Biden's catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan. It wasn't the fact that he was withdrawing, because I was all set to get out. We had nobody lost in Afghanistan for 18 months. I spoke to Abdul, the leader of the Talibran [sic]. The press went crazy. Why would you speak to them? Because that's where the problem is. Just like Jesse James said, ""That's where the money is."" When they say, ""Why do you only rob banks?"" He said, ""That's where the money is."" Well, the Taliban was, that's where the killing was. And I spoke to him, and after that we didn't have one death of one soldier for 18 months. And then you had that horrible, stupid, incompetent withdrawal, where they took the soldiers out first. But these families know firsthand the cost of Joe Biden's weakness and incompetence and failure. This family group, and I've gotten to know them. They thought I wouldn't spend a lot of time with them. They were at Bedminster, New Jersey and they thought I was going to come in maybe for about two minutes, say hello. Well, and I thought of maybe had that in mind. I walked in, I saw them. We ended up spending four hours listening to music, right? Out at the terrace, looking up and talking about their loved ones. And they've taken it very, very hard, as anybody would. So I want to thank Darren, Stan, Hoover, and Kelly Barnett, parents of Staff Sergeant Taylor Hoover. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. Christie, thank you very much. Thank you. I'm looking over in the other area. He's looking down. They're all looking down right now and they're proud of you. The parents and sisters and brothers. There are a lot of them here. Christy Shamblin and Cheryl Jules, mother-in-law and aunt of Sergeant Nicole Gee. Where are they? Nicole—That's good. Nicole Gee, such a beautiful—You have the picture that you showed? It was so beautiful. So beautiful. Let me see that. So beautiful. Thank you. That this should have happened is disgraceful. Yep, that's it. Thank you. Say hello to everybody please. All right. Herman Lopez and Alicia Lopez, parents of Corporal Hunter Lopez. A beautiful—a beautiful guy. Do you have that picture? Have it? Like a movie star, right? He look like a movie star. Thank you both very much. Steve Nikoui, [standing in front row] this is the father of Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui, and—That's it. You show that picture. CROWD: USA! USA! USA! TRUMP: He's looking down. He's proud of his pop. Thank you very much. CROWD MEMBER: I lost my only child to fentanyl! TRUMP: That's another problem. You're right. That's another—Fentanyl. We were going to have it stopped. We had a deal with President Xi. He sends any more over, he has to give them the maximum death penalty, the maximum penalty, which was the death penalty. [cheers and applause] And then Biden never picked it up. Because you're right. Fentanyl kills hundreds of thousands of people a year. Jim McCollum, father of Lance Corporal Rylee McCollum. Thank you. Thank you, Jim. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Jim. Beautiful, beautiful families, beautiful children. They're not children but they're children, they'll always be children to you, right? They were incredible people. I got to know many of them so well. So unnecessary. They lost 13. But we also had that nobody talks about the 38 people that were so horribly wounded, legs and arms and face obliterated, and hundreds and hundreds of people were killed that day that nobody talks about, on both sides. And just so sad that it happened. It would have never happened if we were elected, if we were in office, first of all, we wouldn't have used that airport. We would've have used Bagram, which is a big airport with tremendous 50 mile surroundings. [cheers and applause] And we would have taken the military out last, right? Not first. You don't take the military out first. You take—Don't forget, in addition to the lives lost and the lives that have been so badly hurt, $85 billion worth of equipment, we gave them, 85. I rebuilt the entire military. We gave them $85 billion worth of equipment and we left many people behind. They're still behind. Nobody even knows what the number is. As President, I will always defend our military families. We will honor our great veterans and we will restore peace through strength. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, we win, we are going to win, we're going to win it as a group, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. And I will do something that nobody else even talks about because they have no idea what's happening, but I do. I will prevent World War III. I will prevent it. [cheers and applause] Big problem. Going to happen. In my next term, we will build the great Iron Dome over our country, a dome like has never been seen before. A state-of-the-art missile defense shield, that will be entirely built in America and create jobs, jobs, jobs. And Pennsylvania is a big part of that, as you know, basically. We're going to have—Hey, 300 missiles were shot into Israel. Only one of them got through, and that was limping through, that got hit too. Think of it. Why don't we have that? Why don't we have that? We're going to have a great iron dome. The best. Ronald Reagan wanted it, but really at that time, that was a long time ago. We didn't have the technology. Today you have incredible technology. We will build a great iron dome, and we're going to build it right here. A hundred percent here. We're not doing it in 17 different countries like these idiots build equipment. You build an airplane, you have the bolts made in Turkey, you have the wings made in London. I say, ""What the hell?"" Supposing you have to build planes quickly, what do you do? One of these countries doesn't come through. Maybe one of them is on the other side. It's the craziest thing. We ended it. I will not cut one penny from Social Security or Medicare, which Joe Biden is destroying by letting millions of people come into our country. He's destroying Medicare and social security. I will keep that promise for four straight years, and I will keep it again. Don't forget, for four years I didn't do anything with social security. Other people would have. We're going to make our country rich again, we're going to make our country great again, and we're not going to do it by cutting social security. By contrast, Joe Biden has cut Medicare advantage for the last two years. Did you know that? He's cut your Medicare advantage, which is a total betrayal of seniors. And just check, you'll see it. He has cut you down for two years straight. And we're not going to do that. We don't need that. Remember this, we have more liquid oil. I call it liquid gold. We have liquid gold under our feet. More than Saudi Arabia, more than Russia. I had Anwar and Alaska approve the biggest site anywhere in the world, probably bigger or the same size as Saudi Arabia. Everybody wanted it. Ronald Reagan wanted it. Everybody wanted it. Reagan couldn't get it. Bush couldn't get it, of course. Nobody could get it. But I got it. And the first thing they did is ended it. We're going to have it restored. We'll get it back very quickly. It's one of the biggest sites in the world. Killer for Alaska, by the way, but a killer for the country, killer for the world. Would have supplied all of the Asian countries with oil. And he ended closing it up. His Secretary of the Interior came in and said, ""Nope, we're not going to do that."" After years of trying to get it. We're going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety, and beauty, better than they have ever been before. And that includes the place that we have to be in right now. And I'll deal with Democrat governors and I","'ll deal with Democrat mayors, because that's what I have. But we're going to rebuild our cities. We're going to rebuild our cities better than they've ever been before. We will take over our horribly run capital in Washington DC. We will clean it up, renovate it, and rebuild our capital so that it's no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world. And on day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and any other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content onto our children. [cheers and applause] And I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate. [cheers and applause] And I will keep men out of women's sports on day one. [cheers and applause] Signed. How embarrassing is it to say that? There's some things that are—You can understand. You always like—As business, you always like to understand the other side. I don't understand open borders. How stupid is an open border? But equally, and to be honest with you, much more importantly, open borders, because you have millions of people coming in and they're coming from all of these places. They're causing tremendous death. Every day you read the paper now, you have a migrant crime, you have a migrant killing. It seems they're all young girls, they're all 13 and 12-year-old girls, to a large extent. But every day you're reading about this. But how embarrassing is it for me to say we will build a wall or we will build a border? But how embarrassing it is to say we will keep men out of women's sports? Who would want men to play women's sports? And yet for them, for all these people, including the fake news media, for whatever reason, it's like a big deal. Who would want it? Did you ever look at the weightlifting records? Records that stood for 18 years, and a guy comes up? ""Have you lifted before? No, I haven't."" When I say a guy, a person who transitioned. ""Have you lifted before? No, I haven't. Really? A couple of days. Oh."" Gets over the thing. Bing, bing, bing. Are we crazy? Or the swimming where they obliterate records. Obliterate. The women get wind burn as the boys go by. ""I'm suffering tremendous wind burn."" ""What happened?"" The doctor says. ""Oh, well I was swimming, I'm an Olympic swimmer, but a person transitioned, and he went by me so fast that the wind burned the hell out of me, doctor."" No, it's so crazy. And it's so horrible for women. It's so embarrassing for women. I will fully uphold our Second Amendment. We will protect innocent life, and we will restore free speech. [cheers and applause] And I will secure our elections like never before. Our goal will be one day voting with paper ballots, proof of citizenship, and voter ID. [cheers and applause] Back to the old days. But until then, Republicans must win. We have to get out and vote. We want to do a landslide that's—You know the expression, two big to rig. Too big to rig, right? From North Carolina, too big to rig. If you took the—This is something, I used to say five. I upped it to 10. I think I could practically up it to 20. If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States and added them up, they would not have done near the destruction to our country as Joe Biden and the Biden administration has done. I think I could make it 20. Who's done this kind of damage? Who has done this damage where we have 20 million people poured in here? And they shouldn't be here, and they're destroying our country. So if you want to save America, get your friends, get your family, get everyone you know and vote. Vote early, vote absentee, vote mail in, vote in person. I don't care how they vote, just get out and vote. [cheers and applause] In addition, we need volunteers and poll watches to watch and make sure they're not cheating, which, of course, they're going to try. It's the only way—Look, I'll tell you what, we came over here—There's a Trump sign on every law, it's crazy. We don't need the votes. You know what we need? We need to secure the vote. It's called secure the vote. We have a big program, secure the vote. We don't want them dumping ballots. We don't want them violating your state legislatures like they did. We have people with signup sheets here today. Basically you go protectthevote.com, protectthevote.com, sign up. Because we cannot let this happen again. And Philadelphia was one of the most egregious places anywhere in the world, what happened in city, what happened in this city? So now they used COVID to cheat. They used a lot of things to cheat. But we're not going to let it happen again. You're not going to let it happen again. [cheers and applause] So in conclusion, from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh, from Eastern to Bethlehem, and from Altoona to right here in Philadelphia, we stand on the shoulders of American legends who poured out their blood, sweat, and tears for our rights and for our freedom. This great city was the home of—Wow. Think of this, Benjamin Franklin, Betsy Ross, the American flag and the Liberty Bell. Not too many cities can compete with that one. It's where Thomas Jefferson wrote the words, ""All men are created equal."" Where our founding fathers declared American independence. Where our constitution was written to secure American freedom. I'll tell you, there is no place like this in terms of that. There is no place like this. And Philadelphia was a city that gave American generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, families, soldiers, and patriots. And they all help build this into the greatest nation in the history of the world. But now we are in serious decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, willpower, and strength. We are a nation that has lost, quite simply, its way. But we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Less than four years ago we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again. [cheers and applause] With the right leadership, every disaster, sleepy Joe Biden has created, can be fixed and can be fixed very quickly. Every problem can be solved and every wrong can be rectified. By this time next year, America borders will be strong, sealed and secure. They will be strong, sealed. And people will come into our country, but they will come in legally. Inflation will be in full retreat. Our economy will be roaring back. Optimism will be surging. The American dream, you don't hear about that, will be thriving again for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. Law and justice will reign all throughout our land. Freedom will be restored. The flame of liberty will be burning bright. Crooked Joe Biden, the worst President in the history of our country, will be a fading memory of the past. And our great silent majority, including the once forgotten men and women of our country, will be the one shaping America's magnificent future when I am the 47th President of the United States. [cheers and applause] Because we are all Americans, and together we will show November 5th to be the most important day in the history of our nation. And always remember, we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. We will make America free again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you, all. Thank you. Thank you Pennsylvania. Thank you both. Beautiful, Beautiful. Thank you. [music: Sam & Dave, ""Hold On, I'm Coming""]",""

Biden, Jr.","May 29, 2024","Remarks at a Campaign Event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Remarks at a Campaign Event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/372467",19727,"The President. Hello, Philadelphia! Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It's good—it's good to be—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. [Laughter] It's good to be almost home. I just live down the road a little bit. [Laughter] Thank you, Kamala, for your partnership. And it is a partnership. And how about another round of applause for our great Vice President. Is she something else? It's great to see so many friends, including my fellow Scrantonian Senator Bobby Casey. Bobby, where are—where are you? There you are. Mayor Parker; Lieutenant Governor Davis; and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Steve Horsford; and members of the CBC who are here tonight, I'm a—if I introduced everybody, I'll be here all night. But look, while he couldn't be here, we're thinking of our dear friend Congressman Dwight Evans. He's recovering. And he's going to recover. He's doing well. And joining us are so many State and local officials from across the country, including a guy from my father's hometown, where he was born, Baltimore, Maryland. [At this point, the President briefly imitated a Baltimore accent.] They say it down—""Baltimore,"" not Baltimore. I want to introduce you to the mayor of—the mayor—the Governor of the great State of Maryland. Where are you, Gov? [Applause] In case you haven't noticed, he looks like he can still play too. [Laughter] It's great to be with you, Gov. Civil rights and community leaders from all across the country. Folks, if anyone whether—wonders whether their vote matters, remember this: Because Black America voted in 2020, I'm—please, have a seat, if you can, if you have a seat. Because Black Americans voted, Kamala and I are President and Vice President of the United States—because of you. That's not hyperbole. Because you voted, Donald Trump is a defeated former President. And with your vote—with your vote—in 2024, we're going to make Donald Trump a loser again. In 2020 and throughout my career—I know a lot of Philadelphians know this because I got so much help when I was running for the Senate in Delaware from Philly—Black voters placed enormous faith in me. I've tried to do my best to honor that trust, staying true to the value set that we share, and got me involved as a kid in the first place: Everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect, faith and family are everything, and we leave no one behind. But, folks, I know it's natural to wonder if democracy—the democracy you hear about actually works for you. When justice is denied, how can it be working for you? When promises are broken, how can it be working for you? When you have to be 10 times better than everyone else to get the same shot, how can it be working for you? I get it. And I know there's a lot of misinformation out there. So I came today to speak the truth: the truth about promises made and promises kept. Do you remember when the pandemic hit—when 20 million people were out of work, when businesses and schools shut down, emergency rooms were overwhelmed, and Black folks were hit harder than anyone else? When Trump was President, he said—and he said this—he took responsibility for none of it—he said, ""It's none of my responsibility."" When I came into office, I promised we'd do everything we can to get us through that pandemic. And that's what we did. That, folks, was a promise made and a promise kept. I promised to put racial equality at the center of everything I do because I vowed I would have an administration that looked like America. Because you voted, we're invested more money than ever in the Black families and communities. A promise made and a promise kept. I promised we'd start to reconnect Black and Brown and overlooked neighborhoods cut off by highways in the sixties and decades of disinvestment as a consequence of it, including here in Philly. But we're—changed that with the Recovery Act of—with the—in the—right now you see all the construction going on, on the highways around here. A promise made and a promise kept. Look, I said I'd remove every lead pipe in America so every child can drink clean water without fear of brain damage. We're doing it. A promise made and a promise kept. I promised we'd also take the most significant action on environmental justice ever to remove the legacy of pollution that smothers fenceline communities, because every child, every American deserves to breathe clean and fresh air. We're doing it. A promise made and a promise kept. I promised to access affordable high-speed internet, because now internet is just as important as it was in the days of Franklin Roosevelt—electricity was generations ago. We're delivering now because no child should have to do their homework at McDonald's when things are shut down, sit in the parking lot with their parent to get it done. Another promise made and another promise kept. I promised to protect your health care. I protected and expanded the Affordable Health Care Act that was Obamacare—is still Obamacare—[applause]—saving millions of Americans an additional $800 a year in premiums. And, folks, the Affordable Care Act is still a big deal. As Kamala just explained, Senators with—debated this, but we finally got it done—we debated—seniors with diabetes are now paying $35 for insulin instead of $400. I'm determined to make that apply to every American, not just seniors, in the second term. We're capping—the bill we've already passed, we capped total out-of-pocket costs for drugs for seniors beginning next year at $2,000 a year total, excluding—including cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year. You pay no more than $2,000 a year. A promise made and a promise kept. And by the way, it not only saves people money, it saves the taxpayers—guess what?—$160 billion cut in the deficit because Medicare doesn't have to pay those exorbitant prices. Folks, one of the reasons I got started and won the first time and subsequent times in Delaware is because of the best HBCU in America, Delaware State. Kamala—[applause]—Kamala says it's some school down in Washington. [Laughter] Anyway, HBCUs are incredible institutions, but they don't have the same endowments as other universities to fund research centers and to do so much more. Because you voted, I kept my commitment, and we're investing $16 billion—the most ever in the history of America—$16 billion. It will grow America. It will save America money. A promise made and a promise kept. I'm keeping my promises that no one should be in jail merely for using or possessing marijuana. I pardoned thousands of people incarcerated for the mere possession of marijuana—thousands. A promise made and a promise kept. And for—their records should be expunged as well, I might add. Folks, it wasn't easy to get a lot of this done. In fact, obstacles every step of the way, we faced. For example, Senate Republicans blocked the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. But it didn't stop me from signing a historic Executive order requiring key elements of that bill for Federal enforcement. That is banning choke holds, greatly restricting no-knock warrants, creating databases for police misconduct, and so much more. But we're still—[applause]—and we did it with the support of George Floyd's family, and we're going to finally get it all done. A promise made and a promise kept. I promised we'd beat the NRA, and we did. As Kamala mentioned, I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. A promise made and a promise kept. And by the way, I'm going to go back and once again ban assault weapons in America. I did it once; I'll do it again. The Supreme Court blocked me from relieving student debt, but they didn't stop me. So far, I've relieved student debt for nearly 5 million Americans—a significant number are Black borrowers—so you can chase your dreams, start a family, buy a first home, start a business, and so much more. And guess what? It grows the economy. It strengthens the economy. I'm going to keep it going. A promise made is a promise kept. But we're—speaking of the—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. ——speaking of the courts, because you voted, I was able to keep my commitment to appoint the first Black woman on the United States Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. A promise made and a promise kept. And I appointed more Black women to the Federal circuit courts than every other President in American history combined. Every single President combined. And overall, we've appointed 200 Black judges to the Federal—I mean, judges to the Federal bench. And guess what? The next President—they're going to be able to appoint a couple of Justices, and I'll be damned if they're not going to have—[applause]. Look, if in fact we're able to change some of the Justices when they retire and put in really progressive judges like we've always had, tell me that won't change your life when Trump Justices are already gutting voting rights, overturning Roe, decimating affirmative action, and so much more. Are we going to let that happen? We can't. Audience members. No! The President. No, we—we really can't. Now, let's talk about Trump's MAGA lies. I don't have an hour, but we're going to shorten it. [Laughter] Trump takes credit for sending all the pandemic relief checks alone. It's a lie. The truth is, the Congressional Black Caucus got that money passed. And when Kamala and I came to office, with the help of the CBC, passed legislation to deliver more checks in the pockets to millions of Americans, including Black Americans—$1,400 checks from the American Rescue Plan we passed, and then $300 a month per child per family through the child tax credit, which cut child poverty in half for Black families. And I'm going to get it reinstated in the second term. Folks, Trump continues to lie by saying Black unemployment was at a record low on his watch. The fact is the record low unemployment happened on my watch, and we're going to keep it going. Black small businesses are starting up at a faster rate in 30 years because of what we've done. The racial wealth gap is the lowest it's been in 20 years because of our efforts. A promise made and a promise kept. I announced significant—the most significant housing plan in 50 years that includes first-time homebuyer's tax credit, building millions of affordable housing to bring rents down. New data shows a 40-percent cut in the gap between home appraisals in majority White communities versus those of color—in communities of color. You know, the same exact builder on either side of 95, build the same houses—if it's a Black community, it's lower—the value, from the very day it's built, ends up being lower than the exact same house across the highway in the White community. We're doing everything we can to right that wrong. And guess what? We're taking on corporate greed to bring down the price of gas, food, and rent; eliminating junk fees. Instead of getting charged 35 bucks for an overdraft, it's $3 now, not $35. The bottom line is, we've invested more in Black America than any previous administration in history has. We're opening more doors for economic opportunity, including access to capital, entrepreneurship, workforce training so you can build a life of financial freedom and create generational wealth, all—all—while being the providers and leaders of your families and community. Another promise made and a promise kept. We're just getting started. In the second term, we want to keep it going to level the playing field by making the wealthy begin to pay their fair tax. It ain't even close. I said I'd not increase the tax of anybody making less than $400,000 a year. Well, guess who—how much—guess how much the average Federal tax rate is for a billionaire? We've got a thousand of them. Eight-point-three percent. Eight-point-three percent. It's outrageous. If the billionaires only had to pay 25 percent, it would raise forty—$400 billion. We'd be able to do everything we're doing now and still reduce the debt. Look, billionaires pay their fair share, not only would it—not only reduce the deficit, but it could provide childcare, eldercare, paid leave, and so much more to change the lives of millions of Americans, as well as grow our economy. But, folks, all progress, all freedom, all opportunities are at risk. Trump is trying to make the country forget just how dark and unsettling things were when he was President. But we'll never forget lying around and him—how he and—and us—him—him lying around, actually. [Laughter] And lying about how serious the pandemic was and say he had no responsibility for it. And telling Americans, ""Just inject a little bleach."" Remember that? The way he's acting, I think he injected a hell of a lot of bleach in himself. [Laughter] Trump—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. [Laughter] You've got it, kid. [Laughter] Trump and his MAGA extremists want to give power back to Big Pharma to charge—continue to charge exorbitant fees. Trump is still determined, in his own words, quote, to ""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act, which would deny 3 million Black Americans health insurance, deny protections for preexisting conditions for millions more. During his Presidency, Trump enacted a $2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefiting the very wealthy and the biggest corporations and exploded the Federal deficit. He racked up more Federal debt than any President did in any Presidential term in history. Tell me about the Republicans and balancing budgets. And now he wants to do it again. At the same time, he is determined to cut Social Security and Medicare. Audience members. Boo! The President. I have a better idea: Let's protect Social Security and Medicare and make the very wealthy begin to pay for it. As Kamala said, Trump brags about gutting Roe v. Wade—standing there, ""I did this""—while he openly encourages voter suppression and election subversion. Folks, reelect Kamala and me and a Democratic Congress, and I will sign the John Lewis Voting Right Act and the Freedom To Vote Act tomorrow, and we will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. It's within our power to do this. MAGA extremists ban books. Did you ever think—if you're anybody over 30 years old—you'd go through a period where we're banning books in America? They're trying to erase Black history. We're going to write Black history, because it's American history. It's American history. Together, we make history, not erase it. To me, the values of diversity, equality, inclusion are literally—and that's not kidding—the core strengths of America. That's why I'm proud to have the most diverse administration in history that taps into the full talents of our country. And it starts at the top with the Vice President. On Memorial Day, I proudly stood with a Black man—the highest order—the first Black Secretary of Defense; second Black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Black women heads of military units who are overseeing the most diverse, strongest fighting force in the history of the world. And, folks, the threat that Trump poses is greater in his second term than his first. It's clear that when he lost in 2020, something literally snapped in this guy. No, I'm serious. That's why January 6 happened, when he unleashed an insurrection. Now he's running again, and he's clearly unhinged. He calls the insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol ""patriots""—""patriots."" If reelected, he wants to pardon, quote, ""every one"" of them. Audience members. Boo! The President. Let me ask you, what do you think he would have done on January 6 if Black Americans had stormed it? Think about this: What do you think would have happened if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol? I don't think he'd be talking about pardons. This is the same guy who wanted to tear gas you as you peacefully protested George Floyd's murder. The same guy who still calls the Central Park Five ""guilty,"" even though they were exonerated. He's that landlord who denies housing applications because of the color of your skin. He's that guy who won't say ""Black lives matter"" and invokes neo-Nazi, Third Reich terms. And we all remember Trump is the same guy who unleashed birthism—the birtherism lie against Barack. And then Trump tells you he's the greatest President—I love this one. He says he's the greatest President for Black people in the history of America, including more than Abraham Lincoln. [The President made the sign of the cross.] Audience members. Boo! The President. I mean, can you fathom that? Where in the hell—like I said, I think he injected too much of that bleach in his skin—into his brain. [Laughter] I think it affected his brain. Some lies are so foolish that you don't have to say anything about them at all. Maya Angelou said, ""When someone shows you who they are""—— Audience members. Believe them! The President. ——""believe them the first time."" You've got it, kid. [Laughter] You've got it. I've shown you who I am, and Trump has shown you who he is. And today, Donald Trump is pandering and peddling lies and stereotypes for your votes so he can win for himself, not for you. Well, Donald Trump, I have a message for you: Not in our house and not on our watch. Let me close with this. [Applause] Let me close with this. And, folks, I know we have a lot more to do. When the full promise of America is not available to every person in this country regardless of race, we've got work to do. But let's not lose sight of how far we've come. And the reason is you. The stakes in this election couldn't be higher. What's at stake is nothing less than the fundamental ideal of America—it defines America: that we're all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, and should be treated that way throughout our lives. We've never lived up to it, but we've never, ever before completely walked away from it either. And I'll be damned if I'm going to let Donald Trump be the reason we stopped being America. I'll be damned if I'm going to let Donald Trump—[applause]—we're not going to let Donald Trump turn America into a place that doesn't believe in honesty, decency, and treating people with respect. And I'll be damned if I'm going to let Donald Trump turn America into a place filled with anger and resentment and hate. Folks, America has always been a place where we've worked toward a more perfect Union, where those who were excluded in the past are included in the promise in the country today. I still believe that. I'm still optimistic. But I need you. So my question for you is simple—a simple one: Are you with me? Audience members. Yes! The President. Talk to your family. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Spread the word. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. As the gospel song goes: ""We've come too far from where we started. Nobody told me the road would be easy. I don't believe He brought me this far, though, to leave me."" My fellow Americans, I don't think the good Lord brought us this far to leave us behind. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and there is nothing—nothing, nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Every time—every time I walked out of my Grandfather Finnegan's house up in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother would yell, ""No, Joey, spread it."" Go spread the faith.","","",""

Biden, Jr.","May 29, 2024","Remarks at a Campaign Event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Remarks at a Campaign Event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/372468",14607,"The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please—please, sit down. Audience member. Four more years! The President. Well, I tell you what, it's a hell of a crew, isn't it? Audience members. Yes. The President. The only one I'm afraid of. [At this point, the President pointed at Lynette Sutton, managing partner of Girl Concrete Inc.] [Laughter] Look, one of the reasons why I'm working with the chairman of the Black Caucus in the Senate and the House and working with the—the elected officials, particularly—this guy is from Maryland. My father is from Maryland. But it's not Baltimore; it's Baltimore. [The President imitated a Baltimore accent.] [Laughter] Baltimore. And we're rebuilding a $60 zillion bridge in Baltimore. Look, here's the deal. I believe—and I think the Members of Congress who've worked with me know this—I believe that everybody deserves a shot, and I mean everybody—based on—it doesn't matter what your gender is, what your color is. And one of the reasons why things are moving the way they're moving is because I've insisted that—for example, I've—I'm listed as the most pro-union President in American history. I'm proud of that. But guess what? I also was very clear to the union presidents: You'd better hire more Blacks; you'd better hire more women. Not a joke. And you know it. And by the way, all the things she's bragging about, I did. [Laughter] Because, all kidding aside, there's nothing that can't be done—I really mean it—not a damn thing that can't be done. You know, and when we talk about small business—and I want to thank the owners here. You know, we talk about small business like it's small. It makes up 50 percent of our economy. Add the Fortune 500 companies, the small businesses equal their economic power. That's what they do: They equal their economic power. They employ more people than the Fortune 500 companies do. It's incredible what's done, and we underestimate it. And it's about time we stop just looking at this trickle-down economy, where you say, ""Okay, if the superwealthy do well, a lot will trickle down on a—our plates, and things will be well."" My dad used to say not a damn thing trickled down on his kitchen table. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. My dad worked like hell. My dad was a smart guy. He did well. But you know, it was always a struggle—always a struggle. I'm from—as you Pennsylvanians know, I'm from Scranton. [The President imitated a Scranton accent.] It's not Scranton; it's Scranton when you're from Scranton. But, all kidding aside, we're in a situation where—when coal died, we ended up—there were no—there was no work up there, and it died when I was in, like, second, third grade—fourth grade. And we moved—my dad moved us back down to where he had been raised in Wilmington—he was raised in Baltimore and then Wilmington. His father moved to Wilmington. And we moved down to Claymont, Delaware. Some of you know Claymont. It's about a good, long driver from here. And one of the things that occurred there was it used to be—they used to have 4,500 steelworkers in Worth Steel. And all of a sudden, it all dried up. There was no work. And one of the things we talked about—my dad used to say: ""A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about making sure you can look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay' and have a chance to mean it."" I mean this sincerely. Not a joke. And in Delaware—the reason I got elected when I was 29 years old to the Senate—we don't come from any money. We come from a three-bedroom house in a little development called Mayfield with a grandfather living with us, four kids. And one relative always—[inaudible]—beyond on my mom and dad. We weren't poor, but it was close family. [Laughter] And—but everybody thought it was a simple proposition: Just give them a chance—just a chance. And so I got involved as a kid in the civil rights movement because—the Philadelphians know this—at least the older ones do—Delaware was the only city in the—State in the Nation, Wilmington the only in city in America, occupied by the military for 9 months after Dr. King was assassinated. I was working for a fancy law firm. I had just gotten a job. And I quit and became a public defender, because there was a National Guard person standing on every single corner in Wilmington, Delaware, with a drawn bayonet—not a joke—a drawn bayonet. So I quit the fancy law firm I got a job with. I hadn't even gotten the first paycheck. And I became a public defender. The point was, my dad always talked about ""everybody deserves a shot""—everybody. And that's what it's all about. And it makes no distinction between whether you're a man or a woman, you're Black, you're White, you're—whatever the background is. Just flat out, everybody deserves a shot. I remember my dad, when—he—every once in a while, when I was practicing law and—as a public defender, my office was near the Du Pont Hotel, which used to be a four-star hotel down in Wilmington. And we—every once in a while, my dad would take me to the grill there for lunch. And so we were walking by one day, and the chairman of the board of DuPont Company came down the elevator. He comes into that lobby, and he said, ""Hello,"" and nodded at my dad. My dad said, ""Hello."" Then he immediately walked over to the shoeshine stand and thanked the shoeshine guys. And I said, ""Why?"" ""Everybody deserves to be treated with dignity—everybody."" I'm not making this up. That's how we were raised, how all of you were raised. Everybody deserves an even shot. And so that's what we're doing. And we're doing it with incredible help. You know, we're in a situation where not only are we dealing with the issue of whether or not Black women or women generally can get into fields they haven't been able to get into before, but guess what Jill is doing? My wife started this effort. We don't spend—we spend one-third as much on research—medical research for women as we do men. That's changing. It's changing. Everything is changing. I've got more women in my administration than I have men in my administration. [Laughter] No, fact. Fact. Fact. Okay? There's a simple reason for that: All the women in my family are smarter than all the men. [Laughter] But my—my point is, I just think what we're all about, cut it all away, it's about giving everybody just a shot. No one is asking for a free ride, just a shot. And that's what we're doing. And I think that's why we have—we have a long way to go. But we have literally the strongest economy in the world right now—in the whole damn world. We've got more to do. What we have to do is make sure that economy benefits everybody across the board, everybody has a shot. And that's why I've changed the way we look at things. We no longer think about building a trickle-down economy. Not a joke. In literal terms, it is you build from the middle out and the bottom up. When the middle class does well, the poor have a shot and the wealthy still do fine, as long as they start paying their taxes. No, I'm not—I'm not—that's not a joke. You know, all that stuff I got done—they told us we couldn't get anything done—I got it done with the Black Caucus and others helping me in the Congress. But guess what? We have a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill—$1.2 trillion. And guess what that means? Remember Trump had ""Infrastructure Month"" for 4 years, didn't build a damn thing. Well, we're changing the way in which everything works in this country. We're—how can you be the most powerful country in the world with a second rate infrastructure, whether it's your ports, highways, airports, et cetera. We're also in a situation where, in addition to that, we made sure that people have a shot to do the things they need to do. You know, I'm not trying to be nice to—I know a lot about HBCUs because Delaware State, which was a State—HBCU, was the place I got organized and started. I went to University of Delaware. But the fact is that—you know, the fact is that this is just people wanting to know that you just give them a shot. And so guess what? HBCUs don't have the money to put in the research labs and all the experimental stuff because they don't have the endowments they have. But those are all the jobs of the future. AI and all the rest cost billions of dollars to get it going. Well, guess what? They told me I couldn't do anything. I got 16 billion—with a ""b""—billion dollars this year—for HBCUs. And there's two reasons. It'd be a wasted asset if we didn't, but I want to prove to everybody there's not a damn thing that a White man can do that a Black man can't do or do better. I mean it sincerely. It's important to get it done. And you go down the list of all the things we're talking about, and one of the things is that a lot of—a lot of people don't know how to get to their—you know, the Government has some good programs, but sometimes, it's hard to figure out how they work. So what did we do? We have an entire staff designed to be able to go out to say to people: ""This is how you apply for this. This is how you do this. This is""—— [The microphone generated feedback.] Every time I walk next to you, DJ, this goes off. [Laughter] I don't know, man. That's one powerful sucker here, man. [Laughter] His program, I walk up, and he—my microphone goes off. But any rate, I guess what I'm trying to say is, I've never been more optimistic in my life, not because I'm President; because I see things changing. And I promise you—I promise you—it's going to seem to—this group will understand it and believe it. But the rest of the world looks to the United States. Imagine—answer the rhetorical question: If we weren't leading the world, who leads the world? Name me a country. Name me one single country that could possibly lead. So we pull the world together. No, I'm serious. And we have such enormous opportunities—such enormous opportunities to change the way in which we have been working, to build things that we've never been able to build. And look, I'll end by saying there's a phrase—I'm—I used to always get kidded at the United States Senate because I was always quoting Irish poets on the floor of the Senate. They thought I did it because I was Irish. That's not the reason. I did it because they're the best poets in the world. [Laughter] And there's a poet who wrote a poem called ""The Cure at Troy."" And he said, ""Once in a lifetime, that longed-for opportunity rises up, and hope and history rhyme."" We have a shot to make hope and history rhyme. We really do. We really do. We've got to remember who in the hell we are. We're the United States of America. We have a value set that goes beyond the Constitution: just basic decency, honesty. It matters. It matters. And that's why I'm so excited about being with all of you. Like I said, in 1969 I got involved deeply in the civil rights movement, nineteen—and I—we used to—those of you Pennsylvanians know that Delaware used to be a slave State and a Southern State in its attitudes. I mean, for real. We have the eighth largest Black population as a percent of the population of any State in the Nation. And one of the things that I—that amazed me was how the community stepped up when you gave it a shot. We've gone from a red State to a blue, blue State, but the reason is—the reason I'm elected—Nixon won my State by 60 percent of the vote when I rate as a 29-year-old kid. You have to be 30 to be sworn in. You can be elected early; you can't be sworn in until then. And I wasn't intending to run. I was running because no one else would run, and they came to me and said, ""You run."" And I went to my—a professor I had at Delaware—University of Delaware. And he was my political philosophy professor. I said, ""What do you think I should do, Doctor?"" He said, ""I think you should""—he said, ""Remember what Plato said."" I mean, ""What the hell did Plato say?"" He said, ""The penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves."" It's really kind of basic. So I ran thinking I'd make a point. I wasn't even sure I could win. But I was smart enough to hire my sister. She and I went to school together. She was 3 years younger than me, 2 years behind me at the University of Delaware. She graduated Phi Beta. I graduated. You know? [Laughter] She managed all my campaigns—[laughter]—you know, so—I guess the point I'm trying to make is, I think we should shoot really high. We should aim high. And look at all that's been changed. For example, you know, the bridge went down over the Chesapeake. And we were there the next day. I was with the Governor. And it was billions of dollars. But guess what? We changed it. It's already cleared, the channel—already moving things. But they told us we can't do all that. Remember? Governor Westley W.O. ""Wes"" Moore of Maryland. That's right. The President. There's nothing we can't do. Remember when the highway—when the guy ran on the—the tractor-trailer took the—the bridge out here on 495? Well, guess what? Seven days. Seven days, because we can do anything when we put our mind to it. And so that's the only thing—I think what you do—those of you in the Black community who take the chances and open the business, take the chances on getting deeply engaged, you give people confidence. I mean, you give people confidence and make people believe we can do what we can do. So I came basically to say thank you. And I ain't going anywhere. Now—I did DJ's program this morning, and he made a good point. He said: ""You can't just talk in generalities and talk about democracy and all this. You've got to talk specifics, how people affect people."" But I figure this is one audience—the one audience I can talk about the general—the general things that have to be done. We need a value set. We have to be what we say we are, that we hold these truths self-evident. I know it sounds corny, but I really mean it. In every single major—I've known every major foreign leader in the last 40 years. I've known them personally just because of the nature my job. And so, when I became President, all these meetings with the G-7 and the G-20 and all these heads of state, there's not a single one that I leave that—one of those meetings overseas or here—that a leader doesn't come up to me—not a joke—as I'm leaving and go like this: ""Joe, you can't let that other guy win. My democracy is at stake""—not ours, his—""my democracy is at stake."" But if we win this and begin to keep this going, we can literally change the Nation and change the world. God love you all. Thank you.","","",""

So we're building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, and the wealthy can still do well, but they ought to start paying their taxes so we can do a lot more things. Anyway, we've been—so far, we've been pretty good. We've had the lowest unemployment rate for a long, long time. We've been in a situation where we've—I've forgiven an awful lot of debt from the folks who have college debt—and billions of dollars of it—so people can start their lives again, people be in a good shape. We're going to—we're—anyway, there's a lot going on. And I just want to tell you—I was talking to—we've got three reverends back there. I saw them at the airport. In addition to asking them to pray like hell for me—[laughter]—I asked their advice on a bunch of things. But all kidding aside, there's a lot we can do. And you know, the days of—I come from a— the State of Delaware. And Delaware is small, but we have the eighth largest African American population in the country as a percent of population. And to our great shame, we were segregated by law, like down here. We—and that's how I got involved in politics early on as a kid. I was—I became a lawyer when—Dr. King was one of my heroes, like many of my generation. And when he was assassinated, we had the National Guard stationed on our streets on every street corner of the city of Wilmington for 9 months, longer than any time of occupation of any time since the Civil War. And I got out of law school—I'm the first in my family ever to go to college. And I got out of law school and had a job with a fancy law firm, and I quit and became a public defender. And one thing led to another, here I am. Audience member.[Inaudible] The President. Yes, that was right. I didn't—I didn't plan on it. But like an awful lot of folks growing up in a situation where—basically, middle class family; three-bedroom, split-level home with four kids and a grandpop living with us. You know, we were okay. I mean, we didn't have any money, but we were okay. And—but there's no reason why we can't really fundamentally change things now. We're on the cusp. And the bottom line—I won't—I'm not going to give you a whole speech here, but the bottom line is: The guy we're running against wants to back up all the—all the prospects, all the progress we made. He wants to do away with the environmental stuff. He wants to take away—you know, there's 3 million more people—African Americans who have health insurance now because we were able to increase it, been able to get to college because of it. He wants to do—cut all that across the board. So, as they say where I come from, this guy is a different breed of cat. He's not your typical Republican. And so I appreciate you looking me over. And if I'm able to do this—I hope it's okay—I'll just wander around and talk to you all privately—not private but, you know, just talk to you, find out what's on your mind. Does that makes sense? Audience members. Yes. The President. And I tell you what, man. It took a long time, didn't it?","","",""

[Laughter] I want you to know I'm a Delaware State guy. Okay? [Laughter] And the Vice President's Howard. So, you know, you guys are okay. But you know, I mean—well, you—okay? Audience member. [Inaudible]—take it. The President. Better take it. [Laughter] You realize how insufferable it's going to be now with my chief guy—used to be—what's his name? I can't think of it now. [Laughter] Used to—he used to be a Morehouse guy. What's his name? Audience member. Cedric. The President. Yes, Cedric something! [Laughter] I tell you what, I'm going to Morehouse tomorrow. And by the way, let's wish this guy happy graduation, man. Tomorrow. And he made a commitment to me: When he's elected President and they say, ""Joe Biden is in the waiting room,"" he won't say, ""Joe who?"" [Laughter] That's the commitment. Well, look, it's good to be back. I was—the last time I was in this room was, I think, 2014, 2015—in that range. And you know, as they say in Claymont, Delaware, where I—when we moved from Scranton, Pennsylvania, moved to a little steel town in northern Delaware called Claymont. And you all brung me to the dance. The reason we're here is because—and all the electeds that are here—and I don't want to start naming; I'll leave somebody out—but you really made a gigantic difference. And everybody—it's easy to forget, but I don't forget—little elections in January elected two Senators—[applause]—two. And every—and I want you all to remember that when we first got elected, we were told that because everything was so close in terms of numbers, we couldn't get anything big done. We got everything done. Because of you. [Applause] No, I'm not joking. Because of you. From the Recovery Act—all the way around the horn, all of it. And we're going to do a lot more. You know, I'm—I really appreciate you giving me the opportunity to do this again. And I really mean it when I say—the Congressman knows what I'm talking about—we've got a—we've got a tight operation. And it's going to be—I think we're going to do well. I think—and you know, look, here's the deal. You hear about how, you know, we're behind in the polls. Well, so far, the polls haven't been right once. Now that—look, we're all—we're either tie or slightly ahead or slightly behind. But what I look at is actual election results. And election results are in the primaries. Look at the primaries. Well, Mr. Trump has—he doesn't have an opponent, but he lost 120,000 votes in Pennsylvania—didn't vote for him. [Laughter] They voted for a woman who's no longer in the race. A hundred—I'm—they're rough numbers; I think it's 120,000, I think. In Indiana, I think it was 100,000 votes. And my point is that this is—I'm not going to take a lot of time. I want to talk to you individually. But the fact is that this election, a lot's at stake—lot's at stake. It's not about me; it's about the alternative as well. You know, he—I think it's fair to say—I won't use the exact phrase that I'd use if I was still playing ball, but my opponent is not a good loser. [Laughter] But he is a loser. [Laughter] And I—[laughter]—oh, I don't want to get started. I'm going to get in trouble. [Laughter] But—but the thing is, he's laid out—and the Republicans in the House, they can tell you; my colleagues can tell you—they're laying out exactly what they're going to do if they win. Everything you let me do, everything you helped me do, everything we've done, they want to undo, from the climate legislation to taking—not allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. American people—instead of 400 bucks a month, seniors are paying 35 bucks a month for their insulin. There's a lot more. There's a lot more. But look—[applause]. And I'll end by saying I honest to God—and I think you think it too; I'm not sure, but I think you know—that our democracy is really on the line. Listen to things he said. They asked him what happens, is he going to accept the loss. He said, ""It depends."" And then he said if he loses, there's going to be a ""bloodbath."" This is the guy who is going to—they're his phrase. By the way, get this week's TIME magazine. Read what he said—in his own words, what he said. So this is an important election for all the people we care about, and we care about all the American people out there. And there's a lot of hard-working folks that are trying to figure out what's going on. And we've got a lot more work to do—we made a lot of progress—a lot more work to do. But any rate, I—as my mother would say if she were here: ""Joey, hush up. You've spoken too much."" [Laughter] But thank you all for being here. And I'd like to come around and talk to each one of you individually, answer your questions. Okay? Thank you, thank you, thank you.","","",""

The President. You're Art's mom? Audience member. Yes. The President. By the way, we have a tradition in the Biden family. Actually, it's my wife's tradition, and I'll get in trouble if I don't exercise it. Both their birthdays today. And by the way, you have to sing ""Happy Birthday."" Are you ready? [At this point, the President led the audience in singing ""Happy Birthday"" to Annie Howell, mother of former Racine Police Department Chief Arthel ""Art"" Howell. He then continued his remarks as follows.] Now you have to let me wife know that I did what I was supposed to do, right? [Laughter] God love you. It's hell turning 60, isn't it?

[Laughter] I can't even say it anymore, man. [Laughter] I can't even say it anymore. Oh, I forgot all the press is here. I'd better be careful here. [Laughter] Well, thanks for having me. Thanks for—I really appreciate you letting me come by. One of the few times I walked in with a chief—former chief of police and not arrested. [Laughter] Anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you. Look, I can't tell you how much I appreciate you letting me come by. You can smile, kiddo. I'm good. [Laughter] She's looking at me like, ""Who is this guy?"" [Laughter] ""What's he doing?"" What's your name? Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. How old are you? Audience member. Eighteen. The President. Eighteen. You're getting old, kid. [Laughter] You know that guy? Audience member. Yeah. The President. Is he okay? [Laughter] What's your name? Racine, WI, resident Jakari Oliver. Jakari Oliver. The President. Jakari. Mr. Oliver. Yes. The President. Well, good to see you, man. Mr. Oliver. Nice to meet you too. The President. Keep the faith. Anyway, I—you know, this reminds me of when I first started running for office 180 years ago. [Laughter] I got elected to the United States Senate when I was 29 years old. And I come from a very modest family. We lived in a three-bedroom split-level home with—in a neighborhood that was in a suburban area they were building and—with four kids and a grandpop. And—but we thought we were okay. We thought everything was all right. And—but my State of Delaware—I got involved in politics because of the African American community. I got to—we have the eighth largest Black population as a percentage in America. And to our great shame, Delaware was a slave State. We have all the vestiges—the State sort of divided two-thirds to one-third. One-third top—we have a canal that separates the entire State, connects the Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware River. And anything above the canal is basically more northeast or central States. Everything south of the canal is Southern. And, I mean, for real. [The President briefly imitated a regional accent.] We're going to talk at you like this. You know what I mean? And—for real. [Laughter] And—the Eastern Shore of Maryland and the Delmarva Peninsula, et cetera. Everybody thinks that the DuPont Company is the biggest thing in Delaware. The biggest thing in Delaware are chickens. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. It's the single biggest—$400 million industry. But my point is that I got involved because when I first got—when I got out of law school—and I went to law school. I had to get some financial help to get there. And I got to law school. When I got back, I got a job with a fancy firm—the biggest, oldest firm in the State that—and it was called Prickett, Ward, Burt, and Sanders. And I got the job. But unfortunately, in my State—show how old I am—Wilmington, Delaware, is the only city in America occupied by the National Guard since the Civil War because when Dr. King, who is one of my heroes—when he got assassinated, we had riots in Delaware. And so the Southern Governor—he was a Democrat, but he was a Southerner in terms of his attitudes—he put the National Guard on the streets for 10 months on every corner with drawn bayonets. Only city in America ever occupied since the Civil War. And I quit this fancy law firm and became a public defender, because I wanted to be—— Audience member. Woo! [Laughter] The President. And so I—and the year I—so I ran as a—they came to me and said they wanted me to run—the local people—run for the State senate as a State senator. And I said: ""I can't do that, because I'm just—I'm working part time as a public defender and part time setting up a law practice. And I can't go to Dover because I wouldn't be able to make a living."" And so then they came back to me 3 days later and said, ""Want to run for county council?"" I said, ""County council, I can't do that."" And then they walked over to the window in my office and said: ""Right over there, that's the courthouse. It meets there twice a week. You can make it."" [Laughter] So I checked this—true story—so I checked it out, and no one had ever won the district they wanted me to run in. So I figured, ""What the hell, I'll do it, because I won't win."" [Laughter] But I'll make the effort—[inaudible]. Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. No, I really—I didn't think it would, because I thought we'd, you know, begin to build—I kept arguing more people should get engaged and run to change the nature of the Democratic Party. Audience member. That's right! The President. So what happened was, I made a mistake. My best friend in the world, my sister—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. That's okay—— Audience member. I'm sorry. The President. ——managed my campaign. [Laughter] My sister is 3 years younger—used to be 3 years younger than me. Now she's 23 years younger. [Laughter] By the way, there is no man in the Biden household that is any younger than any woman in the household. [Laughter] That's the family rule. You think I'm kidding? [Laughter] Anyway, she managed my campaign, and I won. And I won a 4-year term. And I didn't want to go initially, seriously. And—but turns out the decennial Census—every 10 years, there's a new—you know, they redo the districts. And so I got reapportioned from a 4-year term to a 2-year term because Republicans saw something in me I didn't see—that they thought I was going to run for higher office. [Laughter] So this is—no, this is the God's truth. So I'm 28 years old now. [Laughter] So I'm going around the State trying to get people to run, and a group of senior members of the Democratic Party, the ones who were mainstream Democrats—— Audience member. Here we are. The President. ——were—that's right—[laughter]—came to me and said—one day, I was—went to the Democratic Convention down in Dover, Delaware, the off-year convention. And I was trying to get other people to run for office. We were—I just joined a small group of a Democratic coalition to get mainstream, pro-choice, pro-liberal, pro-Black, pro—the typical Northeast Democrat. And so I went down to the convention with three of the guys that I had come down with. One had a radio talk show—his name was Bob Cunningham—and a few others. Anyway. And so, after the afternoon session, I went back to the motel. You know, one of these motels you drive up. There is no building in Dover taller—larger—more than four stories, at least in those days. Not a joke. And so I go into the—I decide I'm going to take a shower and shave to go back that night. So I'm in one of those 9—8 by 10 showers—you know, I mean—restrooms in a motel and—with a shower—with a toilet, a bath, and a shower and a sink. And I have a towel around me and shaving cream, and I'm shaving. And I hear, ""Bam, bam, bam,"" on my—on the door of the hotel room—I mean the motel room. So I figured it's the guys that I came down with—you know, get me in trouble. I said, ""Oh, come in."" I opened—opened the door. I had a razor in my hand, shaving cream, and a towel around me. And there's four senior Democrats standing there. [Laughter] The former Chief Justice of the State of Delaware, who had more people in his family, as a U.S. Senator—when they used to vote through the legislature—than any family in American history—than, I should say, in Delaware history. The State chairman. And the Congressman, who was the good guy who had lost three terms ago because he was too progressive. And a guy named Elbert N. Carvel, a big guy. [The President briefly imitated a regional accent.] Talked at you like this. Former Governor. [Laughter] And—I know I'm—I should—am I boring you here with this story? Anyway—[laughter]. So I'm embarrassed as hell. I'm standing there with a towel around me in a hotel room that has the headboards nailed to the wall. You know what kind I mean. It was clean but—and two twin bed—two—two beds and desk nailed to the wall. And I'm—so I said: ""Come in, gentlemen. Give me—give me a minute."" [Laughter] And I ran in the bathroom, thinking I could change. Well, there was nothing to change into. So I wiped off the—all the shaving cream, and I walked out. And I'm sitting there, and I leaned against that desk—I'll never forget it. I'm looking at four of these—to me, two of them, I'd never met and knew of—never met in my life. And they said—and the Chief Justice said, ""We just came from dinner, Joe."" And then the Governor is going, ""And, Joe, we think you should run for the Senate."" I said, ""What?"" I swear to God. True story. [Laughter] And—because I—because they had asked me to go try to recruit people to run for the Senate. And I said: ""I'm—I'm—I'm too young. I'm only 29."" And the Chief Justice said, ""Joe, you obviously didn't do very well in constitutional law."" [Laughter] Absolutely true. And I said—he said: ""You have to be 30 to be sworn in, but you can be elected earlier. You've just got to wait."" And he said, ""You only have to wait 17 days to be eligible."" And so I thought, ""This is the craziest thing I've ever heard in my life."" So I said thank you, and they left. I went back and rode home with a group that I went down with—the three guys I went down with. But what I did before that: On the way up, I called my—I had a political philosophy professor—you all have one professor, one high school teacher you really respect? Audience member. Yes. The President. And his name was David Ingersoll. And I called him ahead of time. I said, ""Can I stop and see you?"" Because Dover, Delaware, is below Newark, Delaware, and below where my home was near Wilmington. And so I stopped, and I said—I told him what happened, and he said, ""What do you think?"" I said, ""What do I say?"" He said, ""Joe, remember what Plato said."" I'm thinking, ""What the hell did Plato say?"" [Laughter] I'm serious. True story. He said: ""Plato said the penalty—to paraphrase Plato: The penalty that good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves. You should run."" I said, ""Oh, God."" Anyway, so I went home and talked it over with my wife. She said: ""Look, Joe, you're working 40 hours a week trying to get this law firm going, and you're a public defender. And at the same time, you're doing 20 hours or 30 hours a week as a county councilman. Either get in or get out."" Audience member. That's right! Audience member. Wife knows best! The President. But there were a whole lot of things I was worried about back then. I didn't support the Vietnam war—a lot of things going on. And so I ran. But I made the mistake of asking my sister to manage my campaign. [Laughter] Nixon got 60—59.8 percent of the vote in Delaware—almost 60 percent. And I won by 3,100 votes. [Applause] And here I am. And I only got elected because I got—when I run in Delaware—not a joke—I get 90 percent of the African American vote in off-years and—[inaudible]—years because you're the most loyal constituency because I've been loyal to my constituency. And so—and things are changing. Guess what? Now, Delaware is blue, blue, blue, blue, blue. [Applause] Oh, you think I'm kidding? I'm not. We are as blue as you can get. [Laughter] And with a little bit of luck and you all making sure that we change things here in Wisconsin as well—— Audience member. That's right. Audience member. We're going to do it. Audience members. Yes! The President. Well, I—you've got some Senators I would like to see change too. And if we do, we're going to make some—and, look, I'll—I'm going to hush up. As my grandfather would say, ""Hush up."" But one of the things that I think—you know, and I'll be very serious for just 1 second and stop and talk—answer any questions you have or just walk around meeting each one of you individually. You know, I really think democracy is at stake here. Audience member. It is. It is. Audience member. Absolutely. Audience member. No doubt about it. The President. Not—not a joke. When I ran the first time, I made a speech at Independence Hall on democracy. And the press—and they're all smart as hell, the press back here—wondered why I was talking about democracy back then in 2020. And 60 percent of our polling showed people were worried about what was at stake. And we ended up winning. But one thing I want you to be wary of—aware of: Trump means what he says. Audience member. Yes, he does. The President. He means what he says. And he says he's going to get rid of all the stuff that we've done, which is making sure that people don't have to pay 400 bucks a month for insulin for their diabetes instead of $35 a month. Make sure—I'll just go down the whole list. And I was asked—I just did an interview with a national reporter at the last stop I made. She asked the question whether or not I thought that the—would Trump—did he mean what he said when he said, basically, he's not sure he's going to accept the results of the election. And I said: ""He won't. He won't."" So—but we really have to—we can do a lot because I think the public is really ready to see some change. And, anyway. I'm talking too much. Like I said, my mother would say: ""Hush up, Joey. Stop the talking."" Audience member. Keep going, Joe! [Laughter] The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","","",""

Before I begin, I want to say something to the kids here. Your mom and dad, they owe you big for being here. [Laughter] So—— [At this point, the President spoke privately with children seated in the front row of the audience; no transcript was provided.] [Inaudible]—my team? Where's one of my team? You know the deal when I've got two young men over here making a sacrifice? You know what we're going to do, right? Aide. Yes, sir. [The President spoke with some other children in the audience as follows.] [Inaudible]—my staff is going to come over and give you 5 bucks so you can buy ice cream for yourselves, or you can make mom and dad pay if they—[inaudible]. All right? Okay? All right. Okay. I got that settled. You know, I look out at these beautiful children, and I think to myself, ""They're having to stand here and listen to some guy they have no idea what the heck he's talking about."" [Laughter] And I think of—you know, they think when you—when you have—when you're elected to office, it's great to have—your children have a great opportunity. It's a pain in the neck for them. [Laughter] My kids had to stand for so many meetings. I—anyway, I owe them big. Look, first of all, thank you, thank you, thank you for being here. Thank you for all you're doing. And it means a great deal. Florida—I think Florida is in play, nationally. And Nikki is doing a hell of a job as your State chairman. And I made her promise she's going to run again, I hope. [Laughter] Look, a couple of things I want to say. You know, one of the things that earlier today I spoke about—up in Washington and, actually, also last week—talking about that this election is a basic, old-fashioned election. It's about getting out the votes. It's about putting together campaigns the old-fashioned way. Not that we don't use all the technology available, but just everything from knocking on doors to putting up road signs to make sure that we get people to the polls, all those things. And you know, it's a—we've got to—there are some animated issues. Obviously, choice is one of the biggest ones. But it's not the only one. You know, I know you're reading in the press lately that there's a great concern among—I've been doing this for a couple years. [Laughter] Well, it's hell turning 50. You know what I mean? [Laughter] And as—and I've spent an awful lot of my time dealing with foreign policy because I was chairman of that committee and because that's why Barack asked me to—for 8 years, to handle portions of that. And one of the things that people don't understand, I don't think, fully, is we are the essential nation. No, not a joke. It's not hyperbole. It's not bragging. It's—think of it this way: If the United States stepped off the world stage, like Trump wants us to do, who would lead the world? Who would lead the world? And one of the things that's happening now is that—and I've—say this in front of the press that—they've heard me say it before. Every international meeting I attend with other heads of state—whether it's the G-7, the G-20, all these international meetings—before I leave, literally, almost every one will walk up to me and wait to get me in a corner alone and grab my arm and say, ""You've got to win."" Not because of me, but because of the alternative. And they say, ""Because my democracy depends upon it,"" meaning their democracy. So the whole world is looking, and they're looking to see how we handle ourselves in this election, not just on whether we win or not, but how we handle ourselves. And one of the things that—you know, for me, I got involved when I was a kid in electoral politics out of the civil rights movement. And it all got down to one person at a time—I mean it sincerely—organizing. My State, to its great shame, was segregated by law. That's why I got involved as a kid when I got out of high school and into college. And it's about just doing the basic things: talking to people—literally, talking to people. And, for example, we're—I'm really excited. We've raised almost a half a billion dollars so far. [Applause] But here's what excites me: So far, we have 1.6 million contributors—1.6 million contributors—550,000 more than we had last time at this stage of the game. But here's the deal. Of those 1.6 million contributors, 97 percent contributed less than $200. Think of all the numbers that that means. We're in a situation where they have—and as I said, where we raised almost—we're headed toward a half a billion dollars. And that's all about—being able to do the things we have to do in a campaign, especially one that's as hard fought as this and one that is so full of lies, so full of misrepresentations being made. I think—you know, whether the press thinks I'm good, bad, or indifferent, I think they acknowledge that there's less than truth that comes out of the other guy's mouth. And you know, you wouldn't know it from what you read and hear, but you know, we're in pretty good shape in the polls. The—and I know you're all activists, so that's why I'm bothering to tell you this: The polls don't win you an election. But in the last 23 national polls, I've been ahead in 10 of them, Trump has been ahead in 8, and we've been tied in 5. More importantly, the momentum is clearly in our favor. For example, we moved 8 points in the latest Marquette poll and 7 points in the Echelon poll. And the Marist poll now has us up by 3 nationwide. The point I'm making is, people are beginning to listen. This is a time people begin to focus and listen. They have generic impressions up to now, but now they're listening. And they're beginning to listen. And so this campaign's—how many offices have we opened now, total? Where is my—— Aide. A hundred and thirty-three. The President. A hundred—we've opened a hundred—[applause]—133 offices. And here you are. That's the note I had. Yes. And here in Florida, we're opening coordinated offices, hiring staff, and recruiting volunteers as well. But you know, I know we can do this, but I've never been more optimistic. I know—I've been saying this for a long time: I've never been more optimistic about America than I am today. You know, when I—I wasn't going to run in 2020, because I had lost my son in Iraq—because of Iraq in nineteen—anyway, in 2015. But what happened was, remember when, in—down in Virginia, those folks came out of the woods carrying torches and with Nazi banners and singing? For real. It's hard to make it up—make it up. And it just was astounding to me. And a young woman was killed—I spoke to her mom—who was a bystander. And they asked the then-President Trump what he thought, and he said there were—""I think there are very fine people on both sides."" That's when I decided I had to run, for real, because our democracy is also at stake—literally, the democracy is at stake. But the way to make sure people understand that is to go out and find out what's on their minds, see what they need. What is it they're most concerned about? And you know, we—you know, we've had enormous success when we've actually asked people—when we go out and do it the old-fashioned way. And we're just really kicking it up now. We're, you know—we're getting toward the end here. Last time out, we ran, and we raised the vast majority of the money we made in the last 3 months. That's when people began to focus. But we're going to do—we're going to be—we have to be really organized in a big way. But it's basic organization; it's not rocket science. It's knocking on doors. It's sending out postcards. It's getting on the telephone. It's going around and making sure people have rides to the polls, all those things. And by the way, when I ran this time, I made it real clear what I was going to do. I said I was going to change the way our economy works, instead of trickle-down economics where they go—where the very wealthy get all the tax breaks and all that will trickle down and grow the economy. I'm a capitalist. I don't care if you—if you make a billion bucks. Just pay your taxes. [Laughter] No, I really mean it. You know what the average tax rate for someone making—there's—we have a thousand billionaires in America. You know what their average tax rate is? Eight-point-three percent. Not a joke—8.3 percent. Anybody want to trade with their tax rate? Audience members. Yes! The President. But look, everything we've done because of your help you've provided over the last 3½ years, he wants to undo. He's made no bones about it—all of it. Just like you have a—Scott wants to get rid of Social Security. You know, these guys are for real. But look at what we've done. We built—we've got a lot—we've got a lot more work to do, but we built the strongest economy in the world. We've got to get inflation even further down. There's a lot more we have to do. And by the way, I know a lot of people got a little frustrated with me when I said I'm going to be the most pro-union President in American history. Well, guess what? I asked the Treasury Department to do a study: With all the union help we're getting and all the union support that we're—they're getting, what's the impact? Everybody does better. Everybody does better, even the people who are [not; White House correction] paying for the union dues, because guess what? I mean, paying the union wage—because they get the best workers in the world. So my generic point is, there's a lot we have going. There's no reason why we can't reclaim our heritage and who we are as the most generous, leading nation in the world and still grow. So there's a lot more to say, but I'm already saying too much. Audience member. No, you're not. No, you're not, Mr. President. No, you're not. Audience member. Teamsters in the house. The President. Teamsters in the house, that's the—I tell you what. They better damn well be in the house, man. [Laughter] I tell you what. Audience member. The only reason I have a pension—— The President. And by the way—— Audience member. ——is because of you, sir. The President. Is that right? Audience member. The only reason I have a pension is because of you. The President. Well, we did get that done. Anyway—[applause]. Besides, I used to drive an 18-wheeler. You know what I did? Audience member. [Inaudible]—you helped negotiate. The President. That's exactly right. Audience member. Thirty-billion-dollar contract with one of the largest employers in America: UPS. You stood strong with us, and we'll stand strong with you, sir. The President. Well, thank you. I mean, look, I'm getting a little off course here. But the bottom line is this—[laughter]—it matters to ordinary people. When I said, when I got elected, I was going to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, because that way the poor have a chance, the middle class grow, and the wealthy still do very well. They still do very well. And it's working. We've—we have 16 million new employees—I mean, we—it's working. We still have to deal with inflation, and there's a lot of costs out there for ordinary people. We're going to be getting you a lot of information to get to the folks out there. But, for example, we're in a situation now where you have a circumstance where there's a lot of junk fees. For example, you have a bank overdraft, they charge you 37 bucks instead—but guess what? Now they can only charge you 8. Because they're supposed—because it just—I don't want to cost them money, but that—exorbitant prices they're charging. Same with credit card overdrafts. Same—a whole range of things that affect people. My dad—I'll end with my dad. My dad used to say—my dad was a really well-read man who never got a chance to go to college because of World War II. And his—he'd always say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid""—he meant it—""being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it."" The only thing we're about as Democrats, in my view, is giving everyone a shot. Everyone gets a fair shot. And I'll be damned if we're not going to do that this time out. So thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Good seeing you. Audience member. Thank you, Mr. President. [An aide approached the President.] The President. Thank you. [Inaudible]—wait, wait. I'm not going—to take my microphone. Hey—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. [Inaudible]—10 bucks? Aide. [Inaudible] The President. All right. Okay. Hey, kids, remember what I told you now? [Laughter] Remember our deal? All right. Anyway, thank you, everybody.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/371422",11607,"The President. Hello, Florida! Hello, hello, hello. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Well, God love you. Well, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Kaitlyn, thank you for that introduction. And more importantly—— Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience member. [Laughter] We love you, Joe. The President. Well, thank you for that introduction and for your courage, if you're back there—your courage for the—and to share your story. That's not an easy thing to do. You know, Kaitlyn represents millions of women who are enduring unbearable pain and cruelty because of Donald Trump. Audience member. Boo! The President. Sadly, it's pain and cruelty that millions of women in Florida now face. You know, but as I said—as she just said, it's not inevitable. It's not inevitable. We can stop it. When you vote, we can stop it. And thanks to Representative Kathy Castor. Kathy, where are you? There she is. Stand up, Kathy. Kathy is doing an incredible job in Congress, and I—and is a great, great friend. Thanks for riding over with me from the airport. You know, the worst sentence in the English language these days is, ""The President is at the airport."" It means you've got to show up, you know? [Laughter] But anyway, thank you. And I want to thank Debbie, our next U.S. Senator. Deb, stand up. As one—as one senior Senator, years ago when I was a freshman running for reelection in the United State Senate, said to me—he said, ""I'll campaign for you or against you, whatever will help the most."" [Laughter] It's really important you win. This is a critical, critical race. Debbie is running against Rick Scott—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——who wants to sunset Social Security. Audience members. Boo! The President. I think that voters are going to sunset Rick Scott. It's important, man. And thanks to all of you here today. It's good to be at a community college. As a matter of fact, my wife has been campaigning all over the country with me between classes. My wife still is a full-time professor at Northern Virginia Community College. [At this point, an audience member dropped a cell phone.] You lost your phone. Get that man his phone. He's going to be in trouble. Or that woman her phone. [Laughter] She's teaching this very day, Jill is. Community college, as she often says, is one of the best kept secrets in America. No, I really mean it. You know, if I have my way in the next 4 years, I'm going to make community college free. And it will grow the economy. It won't cost the taxpayers. Look, next week, one of the Nation's most extreme anti-abortion laws will take affect here in Florida. It's criminalizing reproductive health care for—before women even know whether they're pregnant. I mean, this is bizarre. I can put—you can put a doctor in prison if he takes care of a patient, as you just heard some version of from Louisiana. You know, this extreme Florida law is going to impact 4 million—4 million—women in the State of Florida. Florida is one of the twenty-one States in America—where America—you can't get access you need for care. This adds up to one in three women throughout the United States of America have this limitation. For 50 years, the Court ruled that there was a fundamental constitutional right to privacy, but 2 years ago that was taken away. Let's be real clear. There's one person responsible for this nightmare, and he's acknowledged it, and he brags about it: Donald Trump. Audience members. Boo! The President. In fact, Trump has bragged about overturning Roe v. Wade, which meant there's no Federal right, no decision can be made—all those decisions are made at a State level. A lot of people don't even know that. They don't focus on it. It's a—every State can make a decision. Well, you know, now Trump says the law is, quote, ""working the way it's supposed to."" Trump goes on to say individual State laws are working—his words—""brilliantly."" ""Brilliantly."" It's a 6-week ban in Florida. It's really brilliant, isn't it? Even before women know they're pregnant. Is that brilliant? Audience members. No! The President. Look, just take a look at Arizona. That goes all the way back to 1864, before Arizona was even a State and before women had the right to vote—concluding that that's the law of the land in Arizona. And today, MAGA Republicans refuse to repeal that ban in Arizona. Trump is literally taking us back 160 years. He says it's up to the States and this is all about States' rights. But he's wrong. The Supreme Court was wrong. This should be a constitutional right in the Federal Constitution, a Federal right. And it shouldn't matter where in America you live. It's about—this isn't about States' rights. It's about women's rights. No, I really—I mean this. I—look—folks, look, now he's worried that voters will hold him accountable for saying he's responsible for getting Roe v. Wade overturned. [Laughter] Donald Trump is worried voters are going to hold him accountable for the cruelty and chaos he created. Audience member. We will! Audience member. We will! The President. Folks, the bad news for Trump is that we are going to hold him accountable. We are. He should be held accountable. He should be accountable for States enacting extreme laws that put IVF treatments at risk for women desperately trying to have families. Voters are going to hold Trump accountable for women being turned away from emergency rooms, like my introducer was; forced to travel hundreds of miles to get basic health care; forced to go to court to plead for help to protect herself and her ability to have children in the future. Folks, voters are going to hold Trump accountable. When women are told by extreme politicians and judges to wait, get sicker and sicker to the point where your life is determined to be in danger. Pregnant women in America are risk—at risk, particularly Black women in America. Audience member. Yes. The President. No, that's the statistic. Data shows they're already too likely to die from complications at birth. I believe voters are going to hold Trump accountable when family members and doctors are threatened with prosecution for trying to help them. Not only that, I believe voters are going to hold Trump accountable and his MAGA extremist friends to prevent all women in America from getting safe and effective medication, like mifepristone. Approved by the FDA 20 years ago, they're trying to outlaw that now. For 50 years, the Court had recognized that women in America had a fundamental, constitutional right, and then Trump took it away by the—with the deal he made. Now, in America today, in 2024, women have fewer rights than their mothers and their grandmothers had because of Donald Trump. Look, I don't think we're going to let them get away with it. Do you? Audience members. No! The President. And, folks, in a sense, I don't know why he's—we're surprised by Trump. How many times does he have to prove we [he; White House correction] can't be trusted? Trump bragged how proud he was to get rid of Roe v. Wade overturned; he took credit for it. He said there has to be ""punishment"" for women exercising their reproductive freedom. Audience members. Boo! The President. His words, not mine. He described the Dobbs decision as a ""miracle."" Maybe it's coming from that Bible he's trying to sell. [Laughter] Whoa. I almost wanted to buy one just to see what the hell is in it. [Laughter] Folks, it was no miracle. It was a political deal to get rid of Roe v.—a deal. A political deal he made with the Evangelical base of the Republican Party to look past his moral character —if they looked past his moral and character flaws in exchange for his commitment to appoint Justices of the Supreme Court who would overturn Roe. Don't think he's making the deal right now with MAGA extremists to ban nationwide abortion in every single State, because he's making it. In fact, the MAGA majority in the House of Representatives has introduced three separate bans—three separate bans to choice—to ban choice nationwide—in every single State, based on the State—each State. These bills—they're overwhelming—have overwhelming support of Republicans in Congress. But know this: As long as I have the power of the Presidency, it's never going to happen. [Applause] I mean it. Congress ever—if Congress ever passes a ban, I will veto that ban. Elect a Democratic Congress. Kamala and I will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. Let's be clear. The overturning of Roe v. Wade also puts at risk broader rights of privacy for everyone. If you think I'm exaggerating, here's what Justice Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion in Roe v. Wade. He wrote that the future cases of the Court should reconsider—reconsider—all substantive due process precedents, from Griswold—Griswold legalized the use of contraception—and Obergefell—legalized same-sex marriage. Justice Thomas means it, and so does Donald Trump. Again, here's what that means: the right to make the best decisions for your health, the right to use birth control, the right to marry the person you love. All that is at risk now because there it is no longer viewed by some of our good friends in the Court as a constitutional guaranteed right. Are we going to let that happened? Audience members. No! Audience member. No way, Joe! [Laughter] The President. I like it, man. Will you come with me? [Laughter] Folks, the extreme laws passed since overturning Roe v. Wade have no place in the United States of America. But what does have a place in America is your voice. In its decision overturning Roe v. Wade and saying States should make the decisions, the Court practically dared women—practically dared women—to be heard. Here's what they wrote in that decision, ""Women are not without electoral or political power."" [Laughter] No kidding. No kidding. I mean, almost challenging you. I said at the time, I don't think the Court of the MAGA Republicans have a clue about the power of women in America. [Applause] I mean it. I mean it. But they're beginning to find out. Since the Dobbs decision, which States said should make these decisions—the Court said that the State should make the decision—States all over this country, from Ohio, Kansas, Michigan, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Virginia—women and men in every background voted to record numbers to protect—in record numbers to protect reproductive freedom. This November, you can add Florida to that list. You can. Are you ready to do that? You've got to show up and vote. Are you ready to protect freedom? It was Donald Trump who ripped away the rights of freedom of women in America. It will be all of us who restore those rights for women in America. And when you do that, we'll teach Donald Trump and the extreme MAGA Republicans a valuable lesson: Don't mess with the women of America. [Applause] And I mean it. Folks, let's get this done. Go to JoeBiden.com, sign up, get involved. I know you all in this room are involved. Talk to your family and friends. Organize your community. Register voters. Get them out to vote the old-fashioned way. Pick them up on election day. Call. ""Do you need a ride to the polls?"" And let's remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there is nothing—nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. We're going to get this done. Audience member. We love you, Joe! The President. Love you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Let's get it done.","","",""

[Laughter] Mom and Dad, I hope you were listening. [Laughter] What an incredible honor. What an incredible honor. I don't want to become emotional, but what an incredible honor to have the support of the Kennedy family. John White, Jr., thanks for those kind words and for carrying on your family's civil rights legacy. And so is your son Kellan, who's doing a hell of a job on our campaign. He's helping us win Pennsylvania. Kerry, I—that was the most meaningful introduction I've ever gotten in my life, other than when my sister introduced me. And I want to thank you for your friendship, well beyond the introduction. It's an incredible honor to receive the endorsement of your family. And it means so much to me. Your mom Ethel, whom I spoke with on the phone a couple weeks ago—well, I guess, last week—to wish her happy birthday, she's always been so gracious to my family during the most difficult time of my life. She's done so much for the country and the world in her own right. And of course, your dad, who I never got to meet—I just missed—he was a Senator from New York. He came up to Syracuse University and spoke, and I waited in line, but I didn't get a chance to physically meet him. I never got—but he inspired me. And his passion and courage inspired my generation. Like millions of Americans, I remember that night on April 4, 1968. I was finishing law school at Syracuse University when we heard Dr. King had been assassinated. The pain and the outrage sparked riots and despair all across the country, including in my home State of Delaware. And then we heard a familiar voice I'd listened to many times—your dad, Bobby Kennedy, standing in the back of a truck in Indianapolis asking for peace and quoting one of his favorite Greek poets. He said, and I quote, ""Even in our sleep, our pain, which cannot forget, falls drop by drop upon the heart until, our own despair—in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God."" I had a hard time to believe that day that there was any wisdom, trying to work out from despair where—where we'd go. It was even harder to believe just 2 months later, on June the 5th [6th; White House correction]. I had just graduated from law school, earned an incredible—and learned about an incredible man, later that night, had been assassinated. Yet another tragedy in your family and a gigantic tragedy for the country. Only two political heroes I had growing up were gone within a month of each other—months of each other. We faced a real inflection point as a nation. When I returned home to my city of Wilmington, one of the cities—only city since Reconstruction to be occupied by the military, the National Guard, with drawn bayonets on every street corner for 9 straight months following Dr. King's murder. When I graduated that summer, I went home to take a job at one of the oldest law firms in the State. But after only a matter of months, I left that law firm and took a job as a public defender because I wanted to be more engaged in the effort. I went on to run for the county council, for the United States Senate, and then as Vice President of the United States. I've done so in large part because I thought that's something your dad would have done. I'm not exaggerating that. He's always been on my mind, been one of my heroes. Today, I sit behind the Resolute Desk, where President John F. Kennedy once sat. And as I look from the desk—if you've ever taken a tour of the White House, I sit in that desk, and I look—in front of the fireplace, to the left is a bust of Martin Luther King, to the right is a bust of your dad. And I remember to keep looking and remind myself what they would do in tough calls. The principles Bobby Kennedy embodied were principles taught by my grandparents and parents around our kitchen table. And that's not hyperbole, that's a fact. My dad used to say everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect, no matter what their station—no matter what. And they thought—I was taught the worst sin of all—and I mean this from the bottom of my heart—the worst sin of all was the abuse of power: physical power, economic power, psychological—that was the worst sin of all—abusing power. And then we have an obligation to each other: to leave no one behind, to give hate no safe harbor. It's up to all of us to preserve and protect the very idea of America. You know, we're unique—we're unique in America—in world history. We're the only nation founded on an idea. Every other nation in the world is founded on geography, ethnicity, race, religion—except us. Think about it. The idea was, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal,"" in the image of God, and deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it. We've never walked from it. And we're not going to walk away from it now. Today, we face another inflection point in history. The 2024 election is about two fundamentally different visions of—for America. Donald Trump's vision is one of anger, hate, revenge, and retribution. He embraces the insurrectionists of January the 6th. He's running on it. And as mentioned already, he promised to be a dictator on ""day one""—his own words. And he calls for—— Audience members. Boo! The President. No, he—you know he means it. And he calls for another ""bloodbath"" when he loses again. Look, your family, the Kennedy family, has endured such violence. Denying January 6 and whitewashing what happens is absolutely outrageous. I have a very different view of America, one of hope and optimism, like I hope all of you do—optimism that Bobby Kennedy embodied. I see an America where we defend democracy, not diminish it. I see an America where we protect our freedoms, not take them away. And I see an America where the economy grows from the middle out and the bottom up—and that way, the middle class does well and the poor have a shot—and where health care is a right, not a privilege. By the way, all the stuff we've done so far—we've done it, and guess what? We've cut the budget by a lot of money: $172 billion so far. So don't tell me it can't be done. I see a future where the planet—we save the planet—as this guy is busting his neck doing—from climate change, literally—the climate crisis in—in America. And we've got to do something—the idea we send our kids to school teaching them to duck and cover. Think about that. The idea, in the United States of America—[inaudible]—duck and cover at school. More kids being killed by gun violence than almost anything else. Folks, the America we're building is significantly different. We're going to get it done. And now, it's time to keep going and not slow down, because there is so much at stake. Let me close with this. I know Bobby Kennedy liked Greek poets, and they're great, but I prefer Irish poets. [Laughter] And that's not a joke, unfortunately. [Laughter] My colleagues used to always kid me for quoting Irish poets on the floor of the Senate. They thought I did it because I'm Irish. That's not the reason. They're the best poets in the world. [Laughter] The one I enjoy particularly is Seamus Heaney. He wrote a poem called ""The Cure at Troy"" that reminds me of the courage of Bobby Kennedy, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. And it goes like this, one stanza. It says: ""History teaches us do not hope on this side of the grave. But then, once in a lifetime, that longed-for tidal wave of justice will rise up, and hope and history rhyme."" In 2024, we have a chance to make hope and history rhyme again. Are you ready to do that with me? Are you ready to move forward, not back? Are you ready to choose unity over division, dignity over demolition, and choose truth over lies? Are you ready to choose freedom over [and; White House correction] democracy? Because that's America. Folks, I've been doing this a long—I know I only look like I'm 40, but I've been doing this a long time. [Laughter] But I've never been more optimistic about our future, and I mean it. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothing—I mean this sincerely. Think about it. We're the only nation in the world—as a student of history, I can say—that's come out of ever crisis stronger than we went in. There's nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we do it together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!","","",""

[Laughter] I tell you what, man, this is a bit of a dream for me. I mean it sincerely. Having the Kennedy clan here supporting me like they are, that really means a lot to me. You know, when I was the age of some of you guys in this audience, the—all I had to look to—not all I had—had to look at the Kennedy family. I have—as I said, I have—I have President John F. Kennedy's desk, the Resolute, where John-John came out through the front of the desk, you know? And I sit there, and I look at the—those two—those two busts by the fireplace. I'm sitting at my desk, from here to the wall, there's President—or excuse me—Martin Luther King and there's Teddy Kennedy, whose brother is the one sitting—brings to my head about what we got to do, but his brother sitting there on that other—other pedestal, Robert F. Kennedy. And look, you're—you're my ticket to the White House: you, Pennsylvania. No, it's not hyperbole. You're the ticket to the White House. And I was able—and you're getting a whole hell of a lot of people on board. I went home, as they say, to—— [At this point, the President imitated a Scranton, PA, accent.] ""Scranon""—[laughter]. There's no ""t"" in Scranton if you're from Scranton. [Laughter] I went home to Scranton, and we got a chance to talk about a lot of things. But the main thing we got to talk about is the value set that's up there, just like it is throughout the working class areas of this State—you know, an awful lot of good people, decent people I grew up with, people who taught me, for real, that—that everything was about treating everybody with dignity, no matter who you were. Not a joke. Not a joke. And so then we headed off to Pittsburgh. And you know, Pittsburgh is back—the ""City of Bridges,"" 438 of them, as a matter of fact. They keep building them too—[laughter]—a whole hell of a lot of them. But you know, steel—you know, I've always joked and said that this not only a steel State, this is a State that has a spine of steel. And the folks in Pittsburgh are really working like hell, and they're doing well. And we're finally making sure that United States Steel stays United States Steel. It's not going to be anything—anybody else's steel. And then, you know, we—I'm here because—some of you remember—some of you—I'm only 42, but—[laughter]—some of you who are a little bit older may remember that, for the longest time, my little State of Delaware, just south of here—I was raised in—after Scranton, in Claymont, Delaware, right on the border. And you know, for the longest time, Delaware had no television station. We were covered by Philly. And one of the proudest moments of my life—I nearly got killed politically—was when I was the most popular Senator in Pennsylvania. [Laughter] No, really. Remember that? It was—because they had to cover—I was on—Philadelphia television as much as both the Senators were from Pennsylvania. [Laughter] But look, there's a lot at stake. And I'm only going to take a few seconds. Audience member. Take as long as you want. The President. No, no, no. [Laughter] It really is about—our democracy is really at risk. It's not a joke. I mean, I'm being deadly earnest. And this guy means what he says. If we haven't learned that now, we're kidding ourselves. He means what he says. And when he talks about being a dictator on the first day, he means being able to negate elements of the Constitution. He's named where they were. He said what he would do. The idea that he thinks that those insurrectionists were ""patriots"" and he's going to free them all if, in fact, he gets elected—I mean, this is a full-blown attack on the Capitol in a way that hadn't happened since the Civil War. So there's a lot going on. He's committed to be opposed to—not just figuratively, literally—everything you've helped me get done—everything. He wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He wants to get rid—just go down the list. So what you're doing here is bigger than me, bigger than you, bigger than any—all of us combined. It's about what kind of country our kids are going to live in. Not because I'm running—not Joe Biden. I mean this sincerely. Not because of me, but because of the opposite, what happens if we lose this election. And it's—you know, Joe has done a hell of a job. I asked Joe to be the Envoy to Ireland when we were—no, it's a big deal. The Irish accords, we were not sure they were going to—weren't going to fall apart. He went over, he gained the respect of the Republic as well as the North, and he made sure they stayed in place. So, Joe, I've got to warn you: If I win, you're not going anywhere, pal. [Laughter] You may be out of the country, but you're going to be working with us. [Laughter] Any rate. So I just want to—I just want to thank you all. You've been incredible to me. Philadelphia has always been the base of how I've won all my elections. I mean, for real. So, I'm counting on it. And you know, Pennsylvania is—I think Pennsylvania is one of those States where it's kind of unique. It's a very successful State. It's a wealthy State. But it's also a working class State, where people keep their word, where people mean what they say, where people show up and do what they say they're going to do. And that's who we are. So I'll end by saying: For the longest time, as a young Senator, I heard about trickle-down economics. You know, there used to be—there was a law that was passed in 1934. It was about unions and could they be—were they legal or not, so on and so forth. But the law that ended up being passed said not only are unions legit and they have a right to—you can't artificially stop them from organizing, but they did a second thing. It said that, in the United States of America, if a President is given money from the Congress to do something that is for America—build a new aircraft carrier deck, build a highway, build—whatever it is the money is given for—he should do two things or she should do two things: Number one, make sure they use American products and, number two, American workforce. That was honored in the breach for the vast majority of the years. When I came to office—and the only excuse could be is there weren't workers that could do the job in America and if there weren't materials to be able to do the job. But since I've been President, it's been investing in America. The longest time we spent, including some administrations—even some—[inaudible]—some Democratic administrations. What did we do? Corporate America—and I know a little bit about corporate America, being from Delaware—more corporations incorporated there than every other State in the Union. That's not a joke. But I've always been straight with them. But what did corporate America decide to do? If they had to build something, they found the cheapest labor in the world to build it with. So, they go overseas so they—the labor was cheaper—whether it was to Taiwan, South Korea, wherever it was—and then they'd import the product back home. We changed that. We are making sure we build it here and sending the product over there. And that's why we're working. And for the longest time, you notice, the—the mainstream economists criticized me, said I didn't get it right. But guess what they're saying now? No, I'm serious. Not—not the right wing, but even the conservative economists. It's working. Invest in—because they started to say: ""This about the government making judgments of what's best for the country. Let the free enterprise system do it."" The free enterprise system didn't do it as well as we're doing it now. It's still a free enterprise system. We decide where to invest the money. So thank you for all you've done. We're going to do well here in the State because of you. But it gets down to basic things. As Joe said, it's about picking up the phone. It's about knocking on doors. It's about standing in the shopping centers. It's about showing up and just asking: ""What do you care about? What's on your mind?"" Because an awful lot of people become very sour. Think about it. It used to be the way we would communicate. Most people picked up the paper and read the, quote, ""Philadelphia Inquirer,"" in the old days, picked up the phone, or turned on the TV and watch the nightly news. They don't do it anymore. It's on this phone. It sounds—no, that's not a joke. If you look at the percentages of people where they get their news, and there's so much on—and it's not—you can almost not blame them because so much of what you read is just flat lies. Simply not true. And so the only way to get through is eye to eye. That's the best way to do it. And that's why I'm counting on all of you. And lastly, I'll point out that, you know, we have 11 headquarters here in Pennsylvania and still we're going—keep going. But we also have more people employed here as volunteers—volunteers for full-time employees as well in this effort. He doesn't have one single headquarter in this State. The one he had, he closed. No, I'm serious. He doesn't have any headquarters around the country. You know how much money we raised so far? We raised a whole hell of a lot of money. We got one-point—but here's the deal: 1.6 million people. Let me make sure that's—either two or six. I—the press is here, and I don't want to be misquoted. [Laughter] Get the exact number. Hang on. Aide. One-point-six. The President. Is it one-six—it's 1.6, isn't it? Aide. One-point-six. The President. Yes. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. One-point-six. The President. One-point-six million individual contributions. Okay. Those of you that have been involved in politics before know what—the next number I'm going to give you is important: 97 percent of those contributions are under—under $200. Ninety-seven percent. Five hundred fifty new contributors—individual contributors just since the last election. I mean, is the—and we raised a lot of money last time around. So, folks, we're really moving. And I think we're going to see in all the—in—I didn't even get into the—into the issues which you all know so well. But I mean—and isn't it amazing how principled the opposition is? [Laughter] Trump: ""I am the reason why Roe v. Wade was overturned. I think it should be States' rights issue now."" [Laughter] ""But, wait, I don't know. Maybe""—— These guys—I'm going to get in trouble. Anyway. [Laughter] Thank you all so very, very much. Appreciate it, appreciate it, appreciate it. Thank you. And thank you.","","",""

Biden, Jr.","April 16, 2024","Remarks at a Campaign Event and Question-and-Answer Session in Scranton, Pennsylvania","Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Remarks at a Campaign Event and Question-and-Answer Session in Scranton, Pennsylvania Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/371249",29060,"The President. Guys, you come up here. Come on. Come on. Good to see you, buddy. Audience member. Yes, you too. The President. Come on. With the Bells and the Bidens, like all of you—my dad used to have an expression. He'd say, ""Family is the beginning, the middle, and the end""—""the beginning, the middle, and the end."" [At this point, the President addressed Eloise Giroux, daughter of Megan Bell Giroux, who introduced the President, and granddaughter of Tommy Bell, a childhood friend of the President.] And you need Secret Service guarding you. [Laughter] But, folks, look, first of all, I want to thank the Carpenters Union. They've been with me for my entire career. They've been loyal to me, and I think I've been loyal to them. Now, one of the things that she hadn't told you is Tommy is—along with Larry—Larry, stand up. This is Larry Orr. Larry is another one of the—he lived right across the gates in Marywood—and another guy named Charlie Roth, the four of us were inseparable. When things changed for my dad up in Scranton and lost his job, we moved back to Delaware, where he was from. And when he originally—that's where he came from—Delaware—to Scranton. And I'd come home though for every holiday, almost all summer. And when I fell in love when I was in law school—I actually wasn't even in law school, I was in college. I went on spring break. I had made $85 of—from a tax return. [Laughter] And—oh, you think I'm kidding; I'm not. [Laughter] And my dad didn't own, but he ran an automobile dealership. And so I had a car, and I put five guys in the car. They all chipped in to pay the way down. We went to Lauderdale. Now, the problem is—I'm going to lose a lot of credibility with all of you—[laughter]—but I'm the only Scrantonian and the only Irishman you've ever met that's never had a drink in his life, because too many people have too many drinks in their life, in my opinion. [Laughter] And so we got down to Fort Lauderdale, and all everybody was doing is drunk most of the time. And I found out that there was a possibility of being able to get on a plane for 20 bucks—$22 round trip to go to Nassau. [Laughter] So I thought, ""Well, there may be some nice girls in Nassau."" [Laughter] The only reason we all came down—any rate. So I got on the plane, and I had two guys with me. We had just finished spring football practice at the University of Delaware. And I had been named as the likely starting safety that year and—next year. And so we started off, and a guy named—his nickname was—he was Mike McCrann. We called him ""Crash"" McCrann. He looked like Rock Hudson and acted like it. [Laughter] And a guy named Fred Sears, who ran one of the biggest banks in Delaware later. And so we walked into—we went to the British Colonial hotel. We—actually, we found a bunch of guys from Michigan. We slept on the floor of their place. And we went to go to the beach. Turns out, all the beaches in Nassau—public beaches, there's none of the college girls. They're—you know, they're all locals, and there's not many people. So we walked down to the beach this particular day—the first day we got there—and the British Colonial hotel had this chain-link fence that ran from the street all the way down into the water so you couldn't cross into the hotel area. And so we wondered what the heck we were going to do. Turns out they—a bunch of folks going in and throwing their towels saying ""British Colonial hotel"" on it over the—barbed wire—not barbed wire—chain-link fence. So I had an idea. We each grabbed a towel, put it around us, and we walked in the front door—[laughter]—no, I'm serious; true story—of the British Colonial hotel. And we walked in, and we acted like—and you walked in, and you had the registration on the left and down the—but straight ahead—like, from here, half again the distance from the back wall—was the glass looking out on the swimming pool and then beyond the swimming pool and onto the ocean. And so we just walked in like we belonged there and walked right out. [Laughter] And I'm standing there, and we're all looking around, and I saw this beautiful young woman. I said, ""I'm going to go talk to her."" And old Crash McCrann, I nicknamed—he was a fullback—I said, ""No, I am."" I said—and Fred Sears, my buddy, flipped a coin. I won. [Laughter] And so I walked up, sat down on the end of the bench of the—and the sun was coming from—toward the water. And it was later—and toward the water. And I sat on the end of the chaise lounge, and I said: ""My name is Joe Biden. I'm from the University of Delaware."" And she said, ""My name is Neilia Hunter. I'm from Syracuse."" And I said hi, and we started to talk and just talking. And I watched this yacht pull up in front. I'm not—this is not a joke. Well, to me, it was a yacht. It was, like, 40, 45 feet. [Laughter] And I see this guy with a white hat on, white, you know, uniform—not uniform—pants and the shoes and the whole deal. And he gets in a little dingy, and he rows to shore. And I'm just—I'm talking to her like—like you're she, and I'm looking up. And I watch the guy pull up, and he pulls a—the dingy up onto the beach. And he starts walking toward us. And I'm just watching him. And he walks straight to us, and he looks down at Neilia, and he says, ""Neilia, are we on for dinner tonight?"" [Laughter] I thought, ""Oh, man."" [Laughter] But what happened was he—she looked, and she said, ""Oh, I'm sorry""—it was the Wickwire family, a major highway contractor in New York—in Skaneateles, New York, in the State of New York. And what—they were neighbors. And she said, ""No."" She said, ""I—Joe and I are going to go to dinner."" [Laughter] And so, with that, he left, and she was mortified. She said, ""I'm so sorry, but I didn't want to."" I said, ""Why don't we?"" I had a total of $42 left. [Laughter] But then, you could buy a McDonald's hamburger for 19 cents or something. [Laughter] So she said, ""Well, I know a place we can go."" And she's a very classy lady. She picked a place she thought we—I could afford. And so we walked into this particular restaurant and sat down. I ordered a hamburger because I didn't have any money, and she—the classy woman she was, she ordered the same thing, like whatever it was. But anyway, we—and I was smitten by her. I really was. And you know, sometimes, there's love at first sight. This really was. I was—my—I was just taken by her. And she was really quiet, and she was lovely. And one thing led to another, and she said—the bill came. And the bill was $48. [Laughter] And I had $23. And I could feel under the table—I could feel this. [The President rested his hand on an audience member's knee.] And I put my hand down, and she put 40 bucks in my hand. [Laughter] Her father was fairly wealthy. He was a Navy cook and an Auburn—if you know Auburn, New York, he had a large diner in Auburn, which was very profitable, and he also had the contracts to do Syracuse University. Anyway, he was a fairly wealthy guy. And so I took it, and I paid. I said, ""I'm so embarrassed."" She said, ""Oh, it happens to my father all the time."" [Laughter] So we're walking back to the hotel she was staying at, and I swear to God, I hadn't kissed her, I hadn't done—we hadn't done a single thing together. And there was a chain and—that—post and chain dividing—stopping the parking lot from coming out of the—and so, like a horse's tail, I was going to show—I jumped over the chain. [Laughter] And I caught my ankle and fell. [Laughter] Totally mortified. She said: ""Oh, that's okay. That's—are you okay?"" I said, ""Yes."" And I got up, and I looked at her, and I know—and this wasn't a joke—I looked at her. I said, ""You know, I think I'm going to marry you."" I give you my word. And she looked at me, and we hadn't even kissed one another, and she said, ""I think so."" From that time on, I quit the football team that year—that was spring practice—the next year, and I started commuting every single weekend. My dad ran an automobile agency, and I made money by getting—there was a place called Manheim Auto Auction, where they—and I would drive to Manheim. And back in those days at Delaware, you could not—you could not have a car on campus. And so a lot of the guys I was with, they were happy to get a chance to drive a relatively new car. They paid $10 for every car we delivered back to Delaware. So I'd get a van, take 10 guys up, get 100 bucks; I'd keep $50. [Laughter] No. And that's how I'd go back and forth every single weekend—every single weekend. And—but sometimes, it just happens. Sometimes, it just happens. And so no man deserves one great love, let alone two. When she was killed in that accident with my daughter as well, my two boys weren't expected to make it. And they were only just 3 and just 4 years old. And what happened was that I got put on that 10-most-eligible-bachelors list in America. [Laughter] You've got it man. I thought it was a pretty cool thing. [Laughter] But I used to send more things to the Secret Service because I'd get women sending me pictures that I was afraid I'd get set up for. [Laughter] And unlike the guy running, I didn't take advantage of any of it. [Laughter] Any rate, to make a long story short, all kidding aside, I would just give them to the Secret Service. So I decided I couldn't—I really couldn't date anybody because every time I'd go out with somebody—I had more yentas in Delaware than you can imagine—very nice to me. And so I just gave up. And I get a call from my youngest brother. He said, ""Joe, I've got just the girl for you."" And he was at the University of Delaware at the time, as this girl was. She used to be 9 years younger than me. Now she's 25 years younger, but—[laughter]. So he said: ""You'll love her. She doesn't like politics."" [Laughter] And I met her, and this third date I went out with her, I realized I was going to marry her. No man deserves one great love, let alone two. So I've been an incredibly fortunate guy—incredibly fortunate. And that's why I kept coming back up to Scranton, because what would happen is, I would drive up on—after I paid my guys their money, I'd drive up on Friday—through Scranton, up 81, up into Syracuse, next to Skaneateles Lake—and then go back. And I'd always stop at my Uncle Jack's house on the way back in Scranton. And you know, everybody's from Scranton, but no one ever leaves Scranton. [Laughter] It's in their—but any rate, I don't know why the hell I told you that. [Laughter] Except you reminded me. Megan Bell Giroux. It was my fault. I told—[inaudible]. The President. No, no, but you know, look, folks, I've ran for—I can't tell you how much I appreciate what you've done. It's a pretty basic thing for me. You may remember when I announced for President, I said I was running for three reasons, initially. I said, one is to restore the soul of America. We lost a sense of decency that was in the way we campaign and what people say and how they talk to one another. And the second thing, I said I wanted to rebuild the middle class because when the middle class works, everyone works—everyone does better. I said, thirdly, I want to unite the country. And I was, understandably, by the national press, viewed as I was—they'd give me credit for being a fairly significant United States Senator and able to cross the aisle and get a lot done, but they thought I was extremely naive. I don't know how we can lead the world when we can't unite ourselves. I really mean it. I mean, so we've got a lot of work to do. And then I decided—my son Beau ended up going—volunteering to go to Iraq. He was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. And he came back—he—his—I was in, I think, 36, 38 times in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Senator and as a Vice President. And he came back—he—his hooch—that's where he slept—was only about 400 yards from a major burn pit. And the burn pit is about the size of a football field—probably 80 yards long, 30, 40 yards wide—burning everything from human waste to oil and the rest. And just like the 9/11 firemen got—my son came back after a year with glioblastoma—stage 4 glioblastoma. And I lost him. And I didn't—I wasn't going to run again. I really wasn't. Not a—I give you my word, I had no intention of running again. And then along came what happened down in Charlottesville. And I talked to the mother who lost that daughter who was killed by these—coming out of a field, in the United States of America, in the year two thousand and—I guess it was '16, '17, '18, in that range, but a little later—carrying torches, Ku Klux Klan, Nazi banners—I mean, literally Nazi swastikas, and marching through the streets. And my future opponent, my present opponent—they asked him what he thought of it. He said there were ""very good people on both sides."" And I'm going to say something that may sound outrageous to you, but I thought—I thought—he's the antithesis of everything I believe, and I thought I could beat him. And that's why I ran. And so what's at stake now, folks, is our democracy. It's not hyperbole. You may remember, when I got the nomination, the first thing I did, I made a speech at the—in Convention Hall—excuse me, in Philadelphia. And I made a speech on democracy. And a lot of people said, ""What's he doing that for?"" Because it is at stake. We've never had this kind of a campaign before. And so, for me, it's not about whether or not you're left, right, or center—although it matters to my philosophy of government—but it matters about whether or not you're going to abide by the basic rules, you're going to have a sense of decency. You—I've never thought I'd see a time when I'm going through a neighborhood or a rural town that's in the west and see big signs that—have a Trump sign in the middle that says ""F—Biden"" and having a little kid standing with his middle finger, 7 years old, 8 years old. Oh, I promise, it happens all the time. It's not who we are. So the point I'm making is this: We are—think of—it this way: If the United States wasn't leading the world, who could step up to do it? No, not a joke. What other country? What other country? I've known every major world leader for the last 35 years. I know them all by their first names—not a joke—not because I'm important; because of the nature of my job when I was Foreign Relations Committee and a senior Senator. And you know, the rest of the world looks to us. I walk in a room—no matter whether it's the G-7 or the G-20, whatever it is—and they all look to me—not me, Joe Biden; America—because they know we are the essential nation. And you know, Madeleine Albright wrote about us being the essential—she was absolutely right, absolutely right. And we have a chance. We have an incredible chance to change the direction of the world without using American forces. We have an enormous chance. So I said before I ran, I was going to write a book on inflection points in American history, where the things that happen in a very short period of time can determine what the next four, five, six decades look like. We have a chance. We have a chance to change the dynamic in a way that we haven't had before. The postwar era is over. It's over. What's going to follow? So I—when I started the book—and I decided to run instead. I started the book, I talked about how technology has changed the direction in the world. Were it not for Gutenberg inventing the printing press, there would be no unity in Europe. They wouldn't have been able to communicate with one another at the period of time. All the way to the—it's a silly example—Nixon would probably be President but for a televised debate where he perspired a great deal. And—[laughter]—no, I—no, I'm not joking. I'm thinking these things matter. Even to now, look what's happening on TikTok. Look what's happening. What are the source of information? These press people are all honest and decent, and they take real risks. And not a lot—and they don't all like me. But they—[laughter]—no, I'm serious. This is—they're entitled to that. But they take real risks. But, folks, think about it. Where do people get their news these days? I mean, all the data shows hardly anybody watches the nightly news, in relative terms. Who reads the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and the—and so on? I mean, what percentage of people? So where did they get their news? And it's so much—so easy to just flat-out lie and not know what's true. So we've got a lot at stake here—a lot at stake. But for me, it gets down to a basic thing. My dad used to say—for real; my word—he'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than—is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it—and mean it."" That's what this is all about. The vast majority of the American people just want an even chance, just a shot. Just a shot. And it breaks down into everything from taxes to philosophy. But with your help, I've been able to get a lot done that no one thought could get done. We've been able to get a lot done. But there's so much more we have to do, but we can do it. But we have to win. And it gets down to old-fashioned politics, gets down to knocking on doors, gets down to telling stories about why you're for who you're for. It gets down to being able to have—pick these people to put yard signs up. It matters. Last point I'll make—and I'm talking too long, and I apologize. [Laughter] The last point I'll make is, we have over 100—is it 120 or 160? What's it up to now? Individual contributors? Aide. Oh, 1.6—[inaudible]. The President. One-point-six million individual contributors; 550,000 more than before—than—since we started, new contributors. You know what the—of—97 percent of those contributors contributed less than $200—97 percent. There's a real groundswell going on because of you. It matters. It matters. And people are contributing $5, $10, $30, $50. And it's having a real impact and real effect. We have opened more campaign offices because of you all than he—doesn't—hasn't opened any that I'm aware of. I'm not being facetious. I'm not being facetious. We're also in a situation where we're in a position that we're generating a paid staff. That's significant. And we're growing in every State. I've been to—every single—every single of the toss-up States so far. And guess what? If you knock anybody who knows anything about polling, it's awful hard to poll these days. Because—no, I'm serious. But guess what? Even in the polls that are being used now, we're ahead in—35 polls, but—by the way—it's just about continuing to push. And, again, one simple proposition: How do we give hard-working Americans an even shot, an even chance—an even chance to make it? Just that. Nothing more than that. And how do we move people together again? And I think we can do it. I'm confident that we're going to be able to do it. And I feel very good about where we are because of all of you. But thank you for what you're doing. Again, I didn't mean to tell you so much. [Laughter] But thank you, thank you, thank you. Pennsylvania General Election Campaign Director Amy Friedman. Well, Mr. President, I think we have a few folks eager to ask you questions, if we may. The President. Sure. Ms. Friedman. Absolutely. Sam. Sam Kuchwara. Mr. President, what made you run for President? The President. A simple proposition, and I was—I asked that question—I just came from my old home where I was raised in Scranton. A simple proposition that—just simply, people just want a shot. They just want an even shot and just to be able to realize the possibility that what they care about will matter with what will happen. What made me run for President: In fact, when I moved from Scranton—my dad was born in Baltimore. They say—— [The President imitated a Baltimore accent.] Baltimore—[laughter]—in Baltimore. And his dad was with the American Oil Company. And they opened up the American Oil Company, used to—AMOCO, it became. And the Blaustein family owned it. He opened up York, Pennsylvania, then he opened up Scranton. And they moved to Scranton when my dad was a junior in high school. And you know, it's—and so, I was born in Scranton, and then we moved back to Delaware. When we moved back to Delaware, one thing that I hadn't seen in Scranton—there were very few African Americans in Scranton when I was here in Lackawanna County—very few. But in Delaware, we have the eighth largest Black population as a percent of population of any State in the Nation. And in addition to that, we're one of those border States that couldn't—that—it was a slave State that fought on the side of the North because it couldn't figure how to get to the South. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. So was Maryland. So was Tennessee. Anyway—and so I remember when we moved to Delaware, we lived on—in what later became section 8 housing. It was a long way—but very, very modest apartment complex was being built in Claymont with about 400 apartments. And I remember that they'd drive—Mom would drive us up to school in the morning because it was too dangerous to—it was a—the Philadelphia Pike was an—access highway. It wasn't I-95, which is now the way to get there. But she was worried of us crossing the streets. So I was in third grade. My sister was in first grade. And they'd drop us in the parking lot. And we used to watch—and I couldn't understand why this little Catholic school I went to, Holy Rosary—why this bus would go by when we pulled in the parking lot that had what was referred to then as—all full of ""Colored"" children. There were no Whites in it. And even though the major school—public school, Claymont High School, was a right-hand turn three blocks up. I remember asking my mother why they couldn't come—why'd that bus go all the way downtown? And she said, ""Because they're not allowed to go to school with White kids."" ""Not allowed to go to school with White kids."" And that had an enormous impression on me. And it got me engaged in the civil rights movement. I wasn't in any great shape, but I was a public—I became a public defender after getting a job with a fancy law firm. My city of Wilmington, Delaware, was the only city in America occupied by the military for 10 months, with the National Guard standing on the corner with drawn bayonets for 10 months when Dr. King was assassinated because of the riots that occurred. And so I got involved trying to change the Democratic Party and turn it into more—the conservative party on race was the Democratic Party in Delaware. And the Republican Party, which was the party of DuPont, was very, very restrictive on economic issues, but it was more open. So I joined a group of senior members of the—Democratic Party to try to reform the Democratic Party and move it to more of a Northeastern Democratic Party. The Governor of Delaware could choose to be part of the Southern Governors' Conference or the Northeast. And the Democrats often chose to be part of the Southern Governors' Conference. In the southern part of the State there is a canal that goes across the top of my State, the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal that cuts—bisects the State. And when you just go below that canal—and I'm not—this is not a criticism—— [The President imitated a regional accent.] They talk at you like this. Eastern Shore of Maryland. Very southern in the way they talk and the way they move and everything. And so I got involved in trying to change the party. And one thing led to another, and I remember they came to me and said they wanted me to run, the local folks. Trying to get people to run—just show up as Democrats in areas they—that they weren't able to win. And so I got a call—I was a public defender part-time in a—and I had a law practice. I was starting alone. And with that, I remember a group of people from Elsmere, Delaware—the Democratic organization—came to see me, wanted me to run for the State Senate. And I said, ""I can't do that because I'm just starting a law firm, and I can't go to Dover."" And they came back about 3 days later and said, ""Well, why don't you run for the county council?"" I said, ""I can't do that."" And they said, ""Come here."" And they walked me to my window in my office, and it looked across—and they said, ""They meet there twice a week at night."" [Laughter] So they wanted me to run in a district no Democrat had ever run. And I said: ""Well, at least I can do my job. I can go out and run. Make—demonstrate that we're running."" And the problem is, I asked my sister who has graduated with honors from Delaware, who's smarter than me and ran my campaign. And she won a campaign where a Democrat had never won. And all of a sudden, I was in the county council. And—but the Democrats—the Republicans saw something in me I didn't see, for—it's the God's truth. They saw in me that I was going to do something beyond that. I was elected to a 4-year term. And what they did was, they reapportioned me to a 2-year term. So it was either up or out. And I was happy with that. I was prepared to leave and do my practice and work in the party. And one thing led to another, and I won't bore you with the detail, but one day I showed up at an off-year convention, and I was in—I was in the motel after—the local motel getting changed after the afternoon session, go back to the evening session. And I'd come down with some young activists—they were a little older than me, but still young activists—who were involved in trying to reform the party. And I was in one of those 8-by-10 bathrooms—you know they have a shower, a toilet, and a sink. And I got a towel on me and shaving cream, and I hear, ""Bam, bam, bam,"" at my door really loudly. And I wonder, ""What the hell is that?"" I thought it was this guy Bob Cunningham, who had a radio show, and couple of other guys. So I say, ""Okay, okay, guys."" And I walked to the door and opened it up and standing there was the former Governor of the State of Delaware, Elbert N. Carvel, a big guy, about 6'5"". [The President imitated a regional accent.] Talked at you like this. [Laughter] And the State representative who got defeated 4 years earlier as a Democratic State—who was retired—and one of the—from the family that had more so—more Senators appointed than any other family in American history, the Tunnells—and a former retired justice and the State chairman. And they said—and I'm standing in a towel with shaving cream on my face. [Laughter] And with that, they looked at me and said—they come in and said: ""We're coming—we just had dinner. We want to talk to you."" And I walked in, and I said, ""Okay, gentlemen."" And I ran to the bathroom thinking I could put something on. [Laughter] All I could do is take off the shaving cream. I had on a towel. I walked out—two headboards nailed to one side of the wall, the desk to the other side. And I'm—they're—he's sitting on the end of the bed. And I'm sitting down, and they said, ""Joe, we just had dinner, and we think you should run for the Senate."" I said: ""Run? Man, I'm not old enough."" And the former Justice looked at me he said, ""Joe, you obviously didn't do well in constitutional law."" [Laughter] ""You don't have to be—you have to be 30 to be sworn in, but you can be elected at any age. You'll be—17 days after, you'll be eligible. One thing then, I don't know about you, but all of us who have some teacher or some professor we really had faith in. Well, my political philosophy professor at Delaware—which was between—Newark, Delaware—between Dover and my home—was one of those guys. And I called him, and I said, ""Can I stop by and see you?"" And I remember seeing him and asking him my—a question: What he thinks I should do. He said, ""Joe, remember what Plato said."" I go, ""What the hell did Plato say?"" [Laughter] Seriously, it's an absolutely true story. He said, ""Joe, the penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves."" [Laughter] And I was opposed to the Vietnam war. Anyway, one thing led to another. I ended up running not with any enthusiasm as I started. But we had the same kind of thing of—just a lot of young people and people who hadn't been deeply involved. Just—there was a—we had a picnic for our volunteers at the end of the summer. And there was ads on the radio: ""Do not take I-95 South. Biden is having a picnic. There was no accident."" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. [Laughter] Nixon won by 60 percent of the vote. We won by a rousing 3,100 votes. But my point is, it wasn't planned. I love reading these biographies of me that: ""Biden knew he was going to run for President. He knew it was going to happen."" But look, folks, it matters, it matters what we do. You wouldn't be here. You wouldn't be here doing it—forget me. I mean, you wouldn't be here if you didn't think a lot was at stake. And we have enormous opportunities—enormous opportunities. But I know that probably over-answers your question, but—[laughter]. Ms. Friedman. Amazing. Mr. President, thank you so, so much. Hasn't this been amazing?","","",""

Biden, Jr.","April 16, 2024","Remarks at a Campaign Event in Scranton, Pennsylvania","Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Remarks at a Campaign Event in Scranton, Pennsylvania Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/371250",22780,"The President. Hello, Scranton. Well, thank you, thank you, thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. I think I should go home now, except I'm already home. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, take a seat if you have one. And, Amy, thank you for that introduction and for your work as an educator. You know, it was great to meet your family, including your husband Michael, whose uncle Jimmy McNulty was the former mayor and grew up with me in Scranton, Pennsylvania. You know, thanks to the mayor, Paige—excuse me, I'm going to—I was going to talk about the old mayor—Paige Cognetti, for that welcome. And she's been incredible. She's been with me all along the way. It's always great to be with one of America's best Governors, and I mean that sincerely: Josh Shapiro. He's the best. Stand up, Josh. [Applause] Get up. I think Josh and a lot of people are always tired of hearing me talk about Scranton, but it—you know, Scranton is a place that climbs into your heart, and it never leaves. I mean that sincerely. It's home, that's a special thing that's etched into your heart. For me, it was 2446 North Washington Avenue, just a block away from Amy's house. [Laughter] We used to come back after morning Mass at St. Paul's on Sunday—St. Clare's wasn't built until I had moved—and my grandfather, who worked for the newspaper, and my uncles would hold court around a kitchen table with a guy who was sort of the David Broder of the Pennsylvania press—Scranton press. You think I'm kidding. It wasn't, but anyway. And he would—they'd come and have breakfast at the table. And a kid could wander around the table where the adults were sitting, but you could never sit at the table. And I'd walk up and stand next to my grandpop and—while he was—while they were having conversation, and they were talking about what—they'd talk about what was going on in the neighborhood. They'd talk about what was going on in the world. They were all learned men. And I learned a lot here in Scranton. I learned that money doesn't determine your worth. My grandfather would tell me, ""Joey, nobody—nobody—is more worthy than you, and everyone is your equal."" And that was a—— Audience member. Yes. The President. No, that was—[applause]. I learned that no one's looking for a handout. All anybody wants is a fair shot—a fair shot—at making it, and they deserve a fair shot. My dad had a saying. He'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it."" You know, people like Donald Trump learned very different lessons. He learned the best way to get rich is inherit it. [Laughter] Not a bad way. I'm not—he learned that paying taxes was something people who worked for a living did, not him. He learned that telling people ""you're fired"" was something to laugh about. I guess that's how you look at the world when you're in Park Avenue and Mar-a-Lago. But if you grew up in a place like Scranton, nobody handed you anything. You paid your taxes. You made sure being told ""you're fired"" wasn't entertainment, it was a nightmare that people worried about. And all people knew—all I knew about the people like Trump who looked down on us were the people that haven't changed. They wouldn't welcome us in their homes and their clubs. Folks, where we come from matters. When I look at the economy, I don't see it through the eyes of Mar-a-Lago. I see it through the eyes of Scranton—and that's not hyperbole; that's a fact—where honesty and decency matter, where faith matters, where family is everything, where we grew up knowing in our homes that Wall Street didn't build this country; the middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class. We know the best way to build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. Because when you do that, the poor have a ladder up, the middle class does well, and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well. That's a stark contrast from my opponent. He looks at the economy from Mar-a-Lago, where he and his rich friends embrace the failed trickle-down policies that have failed working families for more than 40 years. Scranton values or Mar-a-Lago values: These are the competing visions for our economy, and they raise questions of fundamental fairness at the heart of this campaign that I want to talk to you about a little bit today. Folks, does anybody really think that the present Tax Code is fair? Raise your hand if you think it's fair. I'm not joking. Well, neither do I. [Laughter] I'm a capitalist. If you want to—if you're able to go out and make a million bucks, fine. That's okay. But just make sure you pay your fair share in taxes. A fair Tax Code is how we invest in the things that make this country strong: health care, education, defense, and so much more. But here's the deal. For more than 40 years, our Republican friends have promised that the best way to grow the economy is from the top down. But here's what they don't tell you: It's never worked. The benefits don't trickle down. When the very wealthy pay less in taxes, then we have to borrow more and invest less in the things that families really need, from schools, to hospitals, health care, roads, bridges, and so much more. Think what's happens when that factory closes in Scranton or anywhere around the country, when the school is underfunded, when inequity grows larger and larger. It puts the middle class further in—out of reach and rips the dignity and pride and hope out of communities all across the country, including right here in Pennsylvania. Folks, trickle-down economics failed the middle class. It failed America. And the truth is, Donald Trump embodies that failure. He wants to double down on trickle down. His failure starts with his $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest and biggest corporations and exploded the Federal debt when he was President. Donald Trump added more to the national debt than any President of the United States in a term in all of American history—more to the national debt. Meanwhile, when the pandemic hit, Trump failed the most basic duty any President owes the American people: a duty to care and a duty to respond. Remember when he told us, ""Don't worry; this will all be over by Easter""? Remember when he told us, literally, inject bleach? [Laughter] Bless me, Father. [At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.] [Laughter] Look, think about it. [Applause] Think about it. Because he failed to care, not only did people die, but millions of Americans lost their jobs, their homes, their livelihoods. On Trump watch—on Trump is [Trump's; White House correction] watch, for the 4 years he was President, we lost—nearly 3 million jobs were lost, 275,000 of those jobs lost right here in Pennsylvania. In the Scranton area, Trump lost 17,400 jobs; 180,000 manufacturing jobs lost nationwide, including 37,000 manufacturing jobs right here in Pennsylvania. There are only two Presidents on record in all of American history that left office with fewer jobs than when they entered office: Herbert Hoover and, yes, Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. [Laughter] Look, Trump is running again on the same trickle-down—failed trickle-down policies. Nothing has changed. Just a few months ago, at a closed-door event in Mar-a-Lago, he told his millionaire and billionaire donors the following—this is a quote—""You're rich as hell, and we're going to give you tax cuts,"" end of quote. And then they all laughed about it, not because they didn't think it would happen, because they knew it will happen if he's elected. How does that make me feel? How does it make you feel? How does it make the people I grew up with feel? I think it's outrageous. Trump wants to renew another round of billionaire tax breaks and corporate giveaways. And look, I come from the corporate State of the world: Delaware. I represented it for 36 years. They're entitled to make a fair profit. It makes sense. There is more corporations incorporated in Delaware than every other State in the Nation combined. But this is ridiculous, what's going on now. You know, there are about 1,000 billionaires—billionaires—in America. Do you know what the average Federal tax rate for a billionaire is today in America? For real: 8.3 percent. [Laughter] That's how much Federal tax—no, I'm serious. Not a joke. Far less than the vast majority of Americans pay in Federal taxes. No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a nurse, a sanitation worker. [Applause] I mean it. And that tax break that he passed several years ago is about to expire. But Trump wants to give another billionaire tax break. Listen to what he says. Trump says his MAGA friends want to, quote, ""terminate""—I love his terminology—""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act. That would mean over a hundred million Americans with preexisting conditions who now have health care because of the Affordable Care Act would lose their coverage. One hundred million. It means millions of young people would be kicked off their parents' health care policies once they turn 26. The Affordable Care Act is paid for by a surtax on the very wealthy investment income. Trump wants to get rid of that, and as a consequence, would cost millions of American who lose coverage an average of an additional $6,000 a year to maintain their health care. It would mean billionaires would get, as a consequence of not having to pay the tax anymore, another $3.5 million tax cut per billionaire. You heard me right. Billionaires would each get an additional tax cut every year of $3.5 million. That's 70 times what a typical family here in Scranton makes in 1 year. I have a better idea. As soon as I came to office, I expanded tax credits through the Affordable Care Act and saved millions of Americans another $800 per person per year on their health care premiums. Health care should be a basic right. Those tax credits are going to expire next year though. And I want to make those tax credits permanent. It's the first thing I'll do if I'm reelected is make them permanent. Folks, and my plan calls for a minimum Federal income tax of 25 percent—just 25 percent—on billionaires. Well below the top rate, but fair, and they can afford it. Do you know how much money that would raise? That would raise $500 billion over the next 10 years. Five hundred billion dollars. It would be a drop in the bucket for them. They wouldn't have to sell one single bit of their assets. And imagine what we could do for America. Imagine a future with affordable childcare, paid leave, homecare, eldercare, and more, like every major country in the world has. Of—all this is not only good for families, it creates jobs. It generates growth. It generates income. It generates economic vitality. Because guess what? When you have childcare and you don't have to go out and hire somebody, you can go to work. It—I asked the Treasury Department to do a study: What would—what would—what's the effect of this? The effects of what I'm talking about is increased—increased—economic growth. We have the most successful economy in the world today. But, folks, how does Trump pay for these billionaire tax cuts? Well, Trump recently said Social Security and Medicare, quote—here's his quote: ""There's a lot you can do in terms of cutting,"" end of quote. Well, right on cue, the MAGA Republicans in Congress released their budget, which hasn't gotten nearly enough attention. The budget they proposed for next year would raise the retirement age of Social Security and would slash Medicare. Think about that for a second. MAGA Republicans want billionaires to pay less in taxes, want seniors to work longer before they can retire on Social Security benefits, and they want to cut Medicare. I've got a better idea. Let's protect Social Security and Medicare and make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share in high taxes. And by the way, whether you're liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican, or Independent, whatever you are, think about it: We're not asking much. Just asking for just basic fairness. You know, I've already been delivering real results in a fiscally responsible way. But I know not everyone is feeling it. Just the other day, a defeated-looking guy came up to me and asked if I could help. He was drowning in debt. I said, ""I'm sorry, Donald, but I can't help you."" [Laughter] ""Nothing I can do."" Look, on a serious note, since I came to office—[laughter]—I've already cut the Federal deficit. You know, all the stuff they talk about what we've done—and I'm going to be self-serving a little bit: Every other—every objective alternative points out we've had the most successful economy of any major economy in the world so far. A lot more to do, but guess what? During the whole time, I've been able to cut the Federal deficit at the same exact time by over $1 trillion—$1 trillion. And I signed a bipartisan budget deal that will cut another trillion dollars over the next decade as well. And I know what to cut. I want to cut the Federal deficit even more by making big corporations and the very wealthy begin to finally pay their fair share. We're not asking anything that's unusual. Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny. I hope you're all able to make $400,000. [Laughter] I never did. But they're not going to pay an extra penny in Federal taxes. That's a promise. Nobody. Not one penny. You know, I have to say: If Trump's stock in the Truth Social—his company—drops any lower, he might do better under my tax plan than his. [Laughter] It's possible. Folks, look, I want to cut taxes on the hard-working folks here in Scranton and all across the country, in Claymont—where I moved from Scranton to Claymont, in Delaware—all across the country, like Amy's family. In fact, the child tax credit I extended during the pandemic put up to $300 per child—per child [a month; White House correction] in the pockets of around 40 million working families, and it literally cut child poverty in half. And we still reduced the deficit. We still reduced the deficit. That included helping 1.4 million families and nearly 2.4 million children right here in Pennsylvania. Republicans refused to extend it, which raised taxes on working families. I want to restore it—restore the expanded childcare tax credit—because no child should live in poverty in this country—no child. We've got a lot more work to do. I know the cost of housing is so important. I want to provide families like Amy's a $10,000 tax credit to help them buy their first home or trade up for a little more space. Audience member. Thank you. The President. Well, no, it's important. And by the way, it will grow the economy. When Trump was President in 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America of the Fortune 500 made $40 billion in profit and paid zero—zero—in Federal income taxes. Audience member. Sinful. Sinful. The President. Well, guess what? I came along and took care of the sin. Not anymore. Thanks to the law that I wrote and signed, big corporations now have to pay a minimum—they should be paying more—a minimum of 15 percent-tax. It was a start, but not enough. By doing that 15 percent tax, they pay for every program that people are now benefiting from and still cut the deficit by $70 billion. And by the way, that 15 percent is still less than working people play in Federal tax—pay in Federal taxes. It's time to raise the corporate tax—minimum tax to at least 21 percent so every big corporation finally has to pay their fair share. But you know, Trump and his MAGA friends want to get rid of the corporate minimum tax. With the same law, I gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drugs, which is why those of you have diabetes and need insulin, instead of paying 400 bucks a month, you're now paying $35 a month for insulin. I've been working on taking on Big Pharma my whole career. But guess what? If I put you on Air Force One, we flew out of here, and you went—you name it—you took a prescription you had from a drug company in America, I will take you, any city you name, whether it's Berlin, whether it's in Canada, whether it's in Hungary—wherever it is. And you'll pay 40-, 60-percent less for that same exact prescription. Not a joke. And by the way, when we in fact reduce some—there's much more to come in that health care proposal—that Medicare proposal. For example, seniors, beginning in 2024 [2025; White House correction], no matter how much their prescription drug costs are, they'll never have to pay more than $2,000 a year, no matter what. And by the way, companies will still make money. They'll still make a significant profit—still make a significant profit. It helps reduce the—and by the way, when we do this, it has a benefit, and that's already part of the law I passed. But guess what? Not only does it reduce the Federal deficit—help with the prescription holder, it reduces the Federal debt. You know how much the first tranche of this has done? It's reduced the Federal debt by $160 billion. Why? Because Social Security—Medicare does not have to pay out $400 a month. They're paying out $35 a month. But Trump has committed, if he's reelected, from—gets elected again, he wants to get rid of the law and give Big Pharma the power again to charge again whatever you want, which will also increase the deficit. Folks, are we going to let that happen? Audience members. No! The President. We can't. And that same law empowers the IRS to go after the superwealthy. You know, what—you ever—it's amazing how the—we had passed legislation increasing the number of auditors. Guess who wanted them all cut? No, I'm not joking. Republicans. Why? Because it takes an awful lot of sophistication to be able to go through the tax returns of these billionaires to know what's going on. But while you work hard and pay your taxes, Trump wants to give his billionaire friends the power to avoid paying even what they already owe, not what they should be paying. I know you—if you didn't know better, you'd think I'm making this up, but you can check it all out. Folks, he's coming for your money, your health care, and your Social Security. And we're not going to let it happen. We're not going to—can't let it happen. Look, let me close with this. As you observed—I can't hide it, Scranton fills me with an enormous pride. My mom didn't live in Scranton permanently since 1954. I swear to God, whenever she was asked, no matter where we were: ""Mrs. Biden, where do you live? Where are you from?"" She'd say, ""Scranton."" [Laughter] Do you know anybody who's from Scranton that still doesn't brag about being from Scranton? [Laughter] Look, because I see here what I saw in Claymont, Delaware, where we moved—it used to be a big steel town with 4,000 workers—all gone now. Although, we're back for—with other growth. In Claymont, Delaware, and what I see in so many towns around America: a deep pride—a deep, deep pride—in your work, a deep pride in your family, a deep pride in your community and in your country. I've always thought the World War II monument downtown by City Hall says so much about Scranton. My Uncle Ambrose Finnegan—Bosie Finnegan from North Washington—he served and died in World War II. Right after D-Day, on Sunday, all four of my mother's brothers signed up to go fight in the military. In those days, you could do it—brothers could go off to war together. Fathers and brothers could do the same. And that war—I—and everybody called him Bosie Finnegan. Bosie was a hell of an athlete, but Bosie joined the Army Air Corps before there was an Air Force. And his name is etched on the monument down by City Hall. Here in Scranton, I grew up understanding we have many obligations as a country, but we only have—and I got in trouble for saying this from the time I was a young Senator. We only—we have many—we have only one truly sacred obligation, and that is to equip those we send to war and take care of them and their families when they come home or if they don't come home. I don't want to lose my temper on this. But I think about that statue in town now that I'm Commander in Chief. And I had them double-check if my memory was correct that Uncle Bosie, Ambrose J. Finnegan's name is etched on that statue. I have to say, there are a lot of things that Donald Trump has said and done that I find extremely offensive. But one that offends me the most is when he refused, as President, to visit an American cemetery outside of Paris when he was President. And why? He said that those soldiers who gave their lives were, quote—it was his quote—""suckers"" and ""losers."" ""Suckers"" and ""losers,"" he said it. Who the hell does he think he is? Who does he think he is? These were heroes. These soldiers were heroes, just as every American who has served this Nation. Believing otherwise, that alone is disqualifying for someone to seek this office. Thank God I wasn't standing next to him. But, as I've said, Donald Trump looks at the world differently than you and me. He wakes up in the morning in Mar-a-Lago thinking about himself, how he can help his billionaire friends gain power and control and force their extreme agenda on the rest of us. Listen to what he says. He says, quote, ""I'll be dictator on day one."" Quote, ""I am your retribution."" He promises, quote, ""a bloodbath"" if he loses. This guy denies January 6. Listen—listen to what he says, because you know he means it. I wake every morning thinking about how to make life better, like you do, for working and middle class families here in Scranton and all across the country, where the power and the freedom rest with you and ""We the People."" Maybe that's why millions of everyday power—folks are powering our campaign. So far, 1.6 million people have contributed to our campaign, with 550,000 brandnew this time around. And they're new contributors. But guess what? Ninety-seven percent of these contributions were under $200. It matters. You matter. My grandfather would tell me when I walked out the door in North Scranton—in Washington Avenue in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith,"" when I was a kid. And my grandmother would yell: ""No, Joey, spread it. Spread it."" Let's keep the faith. Let's spread it. Let's remember who we are. We are the United States of America. There is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if—when we act together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, folks. Thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. Thank you.","","",""

[Laughter] Look, the bottom line is, if you think about it: All of us in this room have one fundamental difference between us and Trump. And I mean this sincerely. We have a different value set. It gets—to me, you know, I've been campaigning around the country and been in this job for 3 years, and it's—you know, it makes it—the more I've thought about it, it's just fundamentally different. You mentioned vets. Well, you know this is a guy who said, when he wouldn't go up to visit a cemetery of veterans, that they're a bunch of ""losers"" and ""suckers."" My son was one of those ""losers"" and ""suckers."" You know, it just—I just—I've never heard a President say the things that this guy has said. But the difference is he means them. He means what he says. With your help, we got elected the first time around. And this county and this State is really, really, really critical. Number two. [A toddler in the audience cried.] Number two, my campaign manager here, she's had enough. [Laughter] She doesn't like all that noise either. [Laughter] Look, last week, Donald Trump and I clinched the nominations. We're going to beat him again. We not only have this office; we've opened up four offices so far—we're—in this State. Four. And there are going to be more. And, folks, you know, we're going to keep making the case for a second term by lowering the costs and creating more jobs. You know, we have grassroots support. You know, so far, this campaign, we've raised—more than 1,300,000 people have contributed under $200 to us—1,300,000. And 500,000 of those people are brandnew from before. And it's a—[applause]. And, folks, you know, the fact is that the support around the country is real. I mean, it's not just—and it's not just for me. It's for Kamala and for the Democratic Party. The third thing is, you know, we're—we've already created tens of thousands of good-paying jobs right here in this State as well—by the way, clean jobs—jobs that—clean energy jobs. Trump lost millions of jobs—millions when he was President. It's amazing how the nostalgia for a lost 4 years was. I mean, look, Trump passed a tax cut. Here's what he said. He said in Mar-a-Lago when he passed his last tax cut, which increased the deficit—exploded the deficit larger than any President ever has in a 4-year term. And here's what he said. He said, ""I made a lot of you richer."" This time out, he's saying—he was in Mar-a-Lago, and he told a crowd of people—I want to look down and make sure I get it exactly right. He said—he described the crowd as, ""I know you're rich as hell, but that's why I'm going to give you another big tax cut."" The point is, it's about values. What do we value? Who are we? I mean, who are we for? What are we trying to get done? Folks, you know, Trump wants to undo everything we've done. You know, he wants to strip Medicare of the ability to negotiate prices. I've been fighting my whole career as a Senator and then as a Vice President to make sure that Medicare is able to do what the VA is able to do. The VA can negotiate with the drug companies as to how much they're going to pay for all the medicines that come into the VA, but we've never been able to do it. We finally beat them. And not a joke: If we got back on Air Force One here and you picked any State—any capital in the world and said—and brought a prescription you had to have filled by whatever the company is—an American pharmaceutical company—I can—you could fly to Toronto, to London, to Paris, to Budapest, anywhere. I promise you that you can buy it there for 40- to 60-percent less than you're paying for it. How many of you know someone who needs insulin? Okay, well, guess what? It was costing 400 bucks a month on average. It now costs $35 a month. And by the way, they're still making over 300 percent. Do you know how much it costs to make it? Ten dollars—t-e-n. Ten dollars. We also wrote into the law he wants to get rid of that, in fact, no senior, no matter how high the prescription trusts—bills are—and by the way, some of the cancer drugs are $10-, $12-, $14,000, $15,000—will never have to pay more than $2,000 a year for their drug—[applause]—$2,000. And guess what? With your help, if we get elected the next 4 years, we're going to change that to apply to everybody in America. I mean it. When I first passed the insulin, it—it applied to everyone. When I tried to get it reauthorized, I—the Republicans blocked it. But look, folks, the bottom line is, he wants to undo everything we've done. You know, we've created over 800,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide. We created an awful lot of jobs right here in your State. And by the way, you know, I was—every time I land here, I think of Harry Reid, in Nevada. Harry—Harry and so many of you talked about—talked about the fact that we needed high-speed rail from Vegas to California, to Los Angeles. Well, guess what? It's coming. Well over a billion dollars, man. And you're going to be able to get to—not that anybody wants to get to Los Angeles, but—[laughter]—people from Los Angeles want to get to Nevada. Well, they'll do it in 2 hours instead of 4 and take tens of thousands of vehicles off the road and improve the environment. Look, folks, the fact is that there's a reason why we're doing so well. It's because of union labor. Not a joke. And by the way, that's not a joke. It's a fact. I didn't realize—although I'd been around—you know, I know I've only been around a little—I look like I'm 25, 30, but—[laughter]. But I didn't realize back when the law was passed during the FDR administrations that labor unions were able to organize and the rules—[inaudible]—organization—that they passed a provision in the law that I didn't realize until a couple of years ago—until I—about 8 years ago that existed. It says if a President is given money by the Congress to spend on any American project or individuals that that President must use, one, American products in doing it and, two, must use American labor to do it. As I assume my labor friends will tell you, I've been the most prolabor President in the history of the United States of America for a simple reason. They grow the economy. They grow the economy. I had the Treasury Department do a study. I asked them—I said, ""What is the effect of using union labor on the rest of the economy?"" Everybody does better when unions do better. Everybody does better. Wages up across the board. So, folks, look—I'm going on too long. I apologize. [Music began to play.] [Laughter] That must be my traveling staff. [Laughter] One closing comment. We've never had a President who has said or done some of the things this guy has said. We have thousands upon thousands of people dying in Ukraine. One of the things that Dr. Kissinger said—Henry Kissinger said before—he called about 10 days before he died, and asked if I would speak to him. And so I called—he didn't call. He asked if I'd call him, and I did. And he said—you know, he said, ""Not since the time of—way back when""—— [A toddler in the audience babbled.] Are you really? [Laughter] No, I'm kidding. ""For the longest time, Europe looked over its shoulder at Russia with some dread."" And he said, ""Not since Napoleon have they not looked over their shoulder, until we came along."" He said: ""You've strengthened NATO like it's never been strengthened before. You've united Europe in a way. You've increased NATO and the border of NATO from bringing in Sweden and Norway."" And he says, ""It's changed the world."" This guy is talking about Putin like he's his lost long—long-lost buddy, which he is. No, here's what he said. He said: If Putin—if the—if a NATO member or a European country doesn't do—pay their dues, then come in, do whatever the hell you want, Putin. Folks, this is—this guy is—he has no basis on understanding what American foreign policy is about and what our national security is about. The idea that we'd walk away from a sacred obligation that has existed since World War II, has kept the peace in Europe, is crazy. But look, I'm confident—I'm confident—we get our message out to the American people, we're going to win again. But here's the deal. You're the ones that are going to do it. And that's not hyperbole. I'm not joking with you. It gets on—down to, as we used to say—my football coach, all block and tackling: knocking on doors, calling people, going and making the case face to face with them. That's why we're opening these campaign headquarters. We're opening them all over the country. And we're going to continue to do so, so people can ask questions—people can look us in the eye and ask the questions, and we can have answers—we have answers for them. So the bottom line here is, I feel really good as I go around the country. Not a joke. And by the way, I—and the press are all good guys in here, but—[applause]—but they report a lot of polls. The last four polls out, we're winning. Okay? But guess what? None of these polls mean a damn thing this early on, so we've just got to keep at it. Anybody want to ask me any questions? Q. I have one. The President. Yes. Child Tax Credit/Economic Improvement Efforts  Q. The child family credits really helped save my daughter's family during COVID. Is there any possibility of bringing those back? The President. That is one of the—I—what—I didn't get into—what I plan on doing next time out: We're going to bring back the child tax credit. It cut child poverty in half. And by the way, it grows the economy. When women are able to go to work knowing they have a safely—a safe place for their children, it grows the economy—in terms of education, as well, by the way. We're in a situation where—think about it—you know, a lot of people haven't had the advantage others have had. They may come from a home that is—doesn't have the same background, doesn't have the same educational background, doesn't have books in the house. All the studies show, for example, if a child comes from a broken home where there are no books in the house and mom or dad are having real trouble, they're going to hear a million fewer words spoken before—not the—not different words, total words spoken—than a kid coming from a middle class household. A million. And it puts them—and they start off way, way behind. But what we found out with—there are significant studies being done—that if in fact—if in fact—you have a circumstance where you start a kid in preschool at the age 3, 4, and 5, they have a 50-percent better chance—50 percent of them go on to go all through 12 years and on to college if in fact they have that chance—and it doesn't cost us much. How the hell can we lead the world if we don't have the best infrastructure in the world, we don't have the best education in the world, we don't have the best tax system, and so on. And the other thing I'm going to do—I'm going to talk about it down in Vegas—is that we're going to also make sure that we deal with all those things that affect people's daily lives. Look, you know, I come from a house—and I'll end with this. I'll—come from a household where there was a—we lived in a three-bedroom house—we weren't poor, but my dad—I guess we were technically lower middle class income. We never thought of ourselves that way. But we lived in a decent house, a three-bedroom house, a split-level home with four kids and a grandpop living with us. And I—and you know, but there wasn't—on the trickle-down economics—you know, everybody talks about—not a whole hell of a lot ever trickled down on my dad's kitchen table. My dad used to say—for real, not a joke—my dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect."" For real. For real. ""It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, everything is going to be okay.'"" Well, that's what we're working on. We're building this economy from the middle out and the bottom up. When that happens, everybody does well, including the wealthy. And by the way, I'm a capitalist. If you can make a million bucks or a billion bucks, go make it. Just pay your fair share of taxes. Okay? By the way, you know, we have—in the United States of America, we have a thousand billionaires now since—— Audience members. Wow. The President. A thousand. It was 740 when it was—before the pandemic. Now it's a thousand. And guess what happened? You know how—you know what their—their average tax rate is—Federal tax rate? Eight-point-three percent. I plan on raising it—and we're going to get it done if you give me a Democratic Congress—to 25 percent. That's all. Twenty-five percent. And by the way, guess what that will do? That will raise $400 billion over 10 years. And imagine what we could be doing with childcare, health care, so many other things—— Quick question there. Q. I wanted to ask you, because I know you going to win—[laughter]—I wanted you, when you win, please, support the registry. It's a law that just needs to be adjust and will help—[inaudible]—million immigrants, because, you know, immigrants are the—[inaudible]—base of this country. [Inaudible] The President. All right. Q. It's a—it's a law. It's already 80 years old. It needs to be adjust. Hasn't been adjusted for the last 40 years. So, when you become the President who can—[inaudible]—you will. I wanted to—[laughter]. The President. By the way, get her phone number. I'll call you. Okay? [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Okay? Q. Yes. The President. All right. I know, I know, I know, I know. I've got to go. I—anyway.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370930",10797,"Well, folks, I have to tell you straight up: I like y'all, but I couldn't resist that little baby. [Laughter] Well, first of all, I want to thank you all and thank Luis for that introduction. When you're President and they say, ""Joe Biden is out in the waiting room,"" promise me you won't say, ""Joe who?"" [Laughter] [Inaudible] Folks, look, you know, when I get criticism some places for having such a strong interest in Latino voters and Latino Americans and people here in the country, I point out to them—I say, ""Can you imagine when you have 28 percent of all the students in public school are Latino, and—nationwide—anybody who doesn't pay attention is really stupid."" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Think about it. Think about what this means. Think about the future. There's such enormous opportunities. You know, and I made a historic investment—a $15 billion investment in Hispanic-serving institutions, including Arizona State now. But I should have started off by thanking Mary and Earl. Thank you very, very much. Thank you for very much for hosting us. Small businesses like yours all across America are the glue that holds communities together, and we want to thank you for that. I really mean it. Thank you. Look, and I want to thank my campaign manager you heard speak first. She is a—it's a little bit in her blood. César Chávez is her grandfather. And he's the guy that got me interested. When he came to Delaware when I was running in nineteen—I won't even tell you when—[laughter]—1871. [Laughter] He came to Delaware in the 1970s to help deal with the farmworkers. And we had—we have—Delaware has a gigantic industry in agriculture. That whole thing called the Delmarva Peninsula—Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia—it's a $4 billion industry, primarily in agriculture, but particularly in chickens. And he was organizing. And I got involved with him and in trying to make some headway. [At this point, the President briefly imitated a southern Delaware accent.] And in southern Delaware, they talk at you like this, you know what I mean? [Laughter] And it was one of the best things I ever did in my life, because I learned a whole heck of a lot that I didn't know. You know, and one of the things is that—someone who did so much to improve the lives of Latinos all across Arizona and all across the country, and it's in her blood. It's in her blood deeply. I'm sure it is in a lot of you as well. I'm excited to be down the street from our new campaign headquarters. I don't think we could fit anybody in—everybody in at this moment. But it's in the heart of the community. And we have seven more offices that are—seven offices are opening here and at—by the end of the month. Second thing. You know, we—last time, you're the reason why, in large part, I beat Donald Trump. Let's beat him again. Well, you know, we—I need you. I need you badly. I need the help. Kamala and I desperately need your help, because, look, there's only about six or seven States that are going to determine the outcome of this election. And they're toss-up States, and this is one of them. And I made sure that, by the way, when I got elected that my—I told you my campaign would look like America, my administration would look like America. We have—and I've followed through on that. For example, Secretary Becerra is lowering prescription drug costs. He's heading up one whole agency. Secretary Cardona is easing student debt, among other things. And Administrator Guzman is investing in small business. Look, I want to remind folks, because we turned out in 2020, we achieved the lowest unemployment rate for Latinos in a long, long time. We cut Hispanic child poverty to record lows. We lowered the health care costs. We made historic investments in Latino small businesses. And we addressed gun violence in the communities. And we're excited now that ASU is joining the ranks of other historic-serving [Hispanic-serving; White House correction] institutions, because they can get part of that $15 billion now. [Laughter] Look, one of the reasons why I've spent so much time and effort in dealing with Latino small—Latino universities and Black universities is, they haven't had the endowments these other universities had. So the jobs of the future—the high-tech jobs—they don't have the laboratories. They don't have the ability to train—they—every student is as competent as anybody going to Harvard or Yale or Stanford or anywhere else. But they don't have the—they don't have the means to train. And so that's where the money is going, primarily. It's going not only to get them in school, but to be able to put together the laboratories to train them to be the engineers, the technicians, the people who are going to lead the technology of the future. And look, folks, the fact is that—I shouldn't probably get started on it, but—[laughter]—because I promised I'd be brief because I want to say hello to every one of you, but—[laughter]. Look, this election is not a referendum on me. It's an election between me and a guy named Trump. And this is a guy who—whose—the way he talks about the Latino community is—well, in 2016, he called Latinos ""criminal, drug dealers, and rapists"" when he came down that escalator. Now he says immigrants are ""poisoning the blood of our country."" What the hell is he talking about? No, I'm serious. Think about it. We are—in fact, the reason we're as good as we are is because we are the most diverse country in the world. Seriously, the most—[applause]. And look, you know, that's not all. He wants to get rid of all the programs we put together—from health care, to education, to small-business help. And Social Security, he wants to cut. He said, ""No, I don't want to cut it."" He just said, ""But there's a lot you can do to trim and cut."" Well, let me tell you something. Folks, he only cares about the wealthy. This—I love this quote from him. At Mar-a-Lago, Trump told his friends, and I quote, ""I know plenty of you, and you're rich as hell, and we're going to give you more tax cuts."" That was recently, okay? Well, that's the last thing I'm going to do, I want to tell you. You may remember when we started off this campaign in 2020, there were 55 major corporations that made $40 billion and didn't pay a single penny in taxes. And I was able to get a 15-percent minimum tax on them and paid for every single thing we did and still cut the budget a trillion dollars. And so, folks, look, let me—let me—[applause]. I don't want to get going, giving a whole speech, because I want to meet you. [Laughter] Let me just tell you one thing. The fact of the matter is, I come from a household that is like maybe a lot of yours. We weren't poor, but we were, I guess, technically, from a financial standpoint, lower middle class. When coal died in Scranton, where I was born, we moved down to Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town. And we lived in what later became subsidized housing. It wasn't at the time. It was an apartment complex. And my dad kept trying to figure out how we can own a home. Because you own a home, you can build some equity in a home. When you build equity, you can then save and do—move on from there. And we lived in a three-bedroom split-level home in a development, they called it—45 homes built—the same exact kind of homes. And there were four kids and a grandpop living with us in that home. We never thought we were poor. We never thought we were left behind. But we had to figure out how to get scholarships to go to school. We had to figure out how to pay to get—my dad busted his neck to make sure we had whatever we needed and could have whatever we needed. But the end result of it was that it was—we used to have a thing called trickle-down economics, where if the wealthy did very well, it trickled down, everybody did fine. Well, I observed, nothing ever trickled down to my dad's kitchen table. And so, when I got elected, I decided I was going to build the country from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. That way everybody does well. The wealthy still can do well. They don't pay their taxes very much, but they do well. I'm serious. And the middle class does well, and the poor have a way up. And so that's why we've been able to create all these jobs nationwide. That's why we've been able to grow the economy as we have. And that's just starting to kick in. And, folks, look, you know, I'll end by saying this. The tax system now is not fair. Trump wants another $2 trillion tax cut to be—that's what he says he wants—the first thing he wants to do when he gets elected. Well, his administration caused the biggest deficit in American history in a 4-year period—the biggest in American history. And we've cut deficit by over—by the time it's out, over $2 trillion we've cut the deficit. But here's what he wants to do. He wants to make sure that the biggest corporations continue to benefit. Well, look, in the United States today—and I'll end with this—there are 1,000 billionaires. I'm a capitalist. If you can make a billion dollars, wonderful. If you can make a million dollars, wonderful. But I tell you what: You ought to pay your fair share. You know what—you know what the average—what the tax a billionaire pays—these 100 [1,000; White House correction] billionaires? Eight-point-three percent Federal tax. Every one of you here would trade for that, wouldn't you? Well, let me tell you something. I'm going to make sure it gets raised to a minimum of 25 percent, which is still significantly lower than the top rate. But here's what that would do. If we raised that one thing—if we raised that 25-percent tax, it would raise $500 billion over 10 years—$500 billion. We'd be able to have childcare again for everybody at $300 per kid. We'd be able to make sure that everybody has an access to an education. We'd be able to have early education for families that don't have the capacity. We've been able—we'd be able to do so much more. We'd be able to cut the deficit as well. So, folks, I'm optimistic. America has the capacity to do almost anything. We just have to remember who the hell we are. We're the United States of America. There—[applause]. No, no. And there is nothing—there is nothing—beyond our capacity. We're the only nation in the world that has gone through that I can—and as a—a researcher in history, the only thing—I can—only nation in the world that has gone through—every crisis we've ever gone through, we've come out stronger than we went in—only case, only nation. Let's remember who we are. We're the United States of America. Nothing is beyond our capacity when we work together. And with you all, we're going to work together and change the world here. Not a joke. There is so much more to say, but I'm going to stop now. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","","",""

But I just want to say it's great to so many friends out there who have been with me from the beginning. Looks like Bobby Grady, Kathleen Kennedy, a whole—all so many of you. And I really mean it. You guys brought me the dance in 2020. And I'm proud and willing to do it again. I'm speaking to you not only as the President, but as the great-great-grandson of the Blewitts of County Mayo and the Finnegans of County Louth. My proud—I'm the proud son of Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden—[laughter]—she's looking down right now—speaking from the White House, designed by, I might add, an Irish architect. Look, my grandfather Ambrose Finnegan used to say, for real, ""Joey, if you're lucky enough to be Irish, you're lucky enough."" Well, all of us Irish Americans are lucky we have ancestors who came to these shores. It's a—it was a precious gift, the belief that America was a place of possibilities. I used to hear the stories from my grandfather about his father and his grandfather when they came. As I made clear at the State of the Union, we're still in the battle for the soul of America—and that's not hyperbole—between forces who want to pull America back and those who want to move us into the future. Those who—it's a real battle between the old ideas of hate, anger, revenge, and retribution and the core American values that brought our ancestors here: honesty, decency, dignity, equality. Irish Americans have always stepped up in that fight—[inaudible]. For real. That's who we are. We're the only people in the world who are nostalgic about the future, I've said—and I mean it. A future where we defend democracy, not diminish it; expand freedom, not restrict it. I know each one of us can do this. I know we can do this. I want to thank you for your support and your friendship. To borrow a line from Yeats, he said, ""Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such friends."" You've been an incredible friend to me. And I really mean it. And I—I'm—[inaudible]—the Irish of it—we never give up. We know what the—[inaudible]—look like. We know what—[inaudible]—out there. We know and we just never stop. We can't stop now. There's so much—there's so much at stake. The guy I'm running against a second time you helped me beat the first time is a guy who doesn't share our values, and this is all about values. It's who we are as Americans. We are a nation of values and dignity. You've heard me say many times: My dad used to say: ""Your job is about a lot more than your—a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'It's going to be okay, honey.'"" That's what we're all about. That's what we're all about. And I just left the Taoiseach from Ireland and the Speaker, Johnson. I met with all the folks at—who are Irish Americans—[inaudible]—in the Congress and the Senate and they have—and—anyway—I—I'm not supposed to be talking this long here.

[Laughter] Okay? Folks, look, we've got a lot to do. And there's an awful lot at stake in this campaign. I need not tell you all. You all understand it fully. One of the things that is—that I like about this campaign, particularly here in this State, is—by the way, this is the first time headquarters has been here in Milwaukee. Well, there's a reason for that. There's a reason for that. Because if it wasn't, I'd be afraid of going back with Gwen. You know—[laughter]. But all kidding aside, look, this is about ordinary people. I grew up in a neighborhood that was not poor, but middle class—technically, lower middle class—you know, a three-bedroom house with four kids and a grandpop living with us. And, you know, t was decent, but, you know, there wasn't anything left over at the end of the month. And so what I started to do was—my dad used to say—that trickle-down economic program had been going on for years, not a whole hell of a lot trickled down on my dad's kitchen table. [Laughter] And so we decided to make a completely different approach to how we were going to govern the country. And one of those was to make sure that we invested in people, we built them from the middle out and the bottom up. When that occurs, the wealthy still do very well. But it's about time they start paying their fair share of taxes. [Applause] Oh! And today I just came from announcing a $36 million project to reconnect this city in a way that it should never have been separated in the first place. The reason I know that, my city—the city of Wilmington, Delaware, where I grew up—is a situation where we have I-95, not I—what's that, I-50—— Audience member. Ninety-four. The President. ——50—94 here. And it's about a—about a little—almost a quarter mile wide going through the city and divided a neighborhood and had profound impacts on the economy. And I'm President of the United States; I'm in charge of this program. They haven't funded Delaware yet. I'm like what the hell's going on here? [Laughter] But we have, you know, over $3 billion to do this across the country. It's about bringing people together. You know, we've—I have a very different view than—as you know, than the opposition here, the guys I'm running against. I don't think we're a dying nation; I think we're a growing nation. I don't think we're behind. No, I really mean it. And I've been doing it a long time. But, you know, it's never—I've never been more optimistic about America's prospects—never, never, never. And so, but they all—it's—and I know it sounds like hyperbole, but it's all in your hands and you—folks like you all across the country, because this is how I won the first time I ever ran, and this is how we're going to win again. A lot of you helped me in 2020, and we made sure he was a loser—he is a loser. [Laughter] And we're going to make sure that happens again, right? [Applause] And, by the way, we are—we are—a country of immigrants. Audience member. Yes! The President. We're—they are not ""vermin."" And look, you know, the fact of the matter is, all of us are immigrants—every one of us except the Native Americans here. And the fact of the matter is that we—it's what built this country. That's why we're the most unique country in the world, the most powerful nation in the world, the most connected nation in the world. And we've got to take advantage of it, not walk away from it. Any rate. A lot more to talk about, but I want to—just came to say thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. And by the way, history is watching. History is watching. [The President gestured toward Harry Abramson.] This young man is going to be reading about what we do and don't do. Now, I don't mean me personally—what we do as a generation now. We have a chance to really turn this country in the right direction, move in directions that are—— You know, we have the most vibrant economy in the world. We've got a lot more to do—a lot more to do. We're investing in health care. We're investing in all the things that matter, all the things that your Senator from this State, Johnson, says if back to—if we win, he's going to try to eliminate—eliminate. So, we—this is really important—really important, not because of me, but because of all of you and all we can do. [The President read a sign held by audience member Chris Syrrakos, a cannabis business owner from Menomonee Falls, WI.] So, ""No one should be jailed""—by the way, I'm taking care of that. No one is going to be jailed. [Laughter] No one should be jailed for just using and possessing marijuana and it staying on their record. Mr. Syrrakos. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Shake my hand on that. [The President shook hands with Mr. Syrrakos.] The President. And, by the way—— Mr. Syrrakos. Yes, sir, Mr. President. The President. And, by the way, the fact of the matter is, that stays on their record all—the whole time just for smoking marijuana. Now, if you're out selling it, if you're out growing, it's a different deal. But if you're just using, it should be wiped off your record. Because you have that on your record, you have to—""Have you ever been arrested or do you have a felony on your record?"" You have to put yes. Not anymore. Not anymore. Anyway, we've got to do everything from gun violence to deal with choice. You know, our freedoms are at stake. They really are at stake—not a joke—the right to choose, the right to be able to determine whether you're going to get to vote, how we vote. There's so much more we can do. But I'm talking too much. I just want to talk to you each individually. Thank you all very, very much.","","",""

Biden, Jr.","March 11, 2024","Remarks at a Campaign Event in Manchester, New Hampshire","Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Remarks at a Campaign Event in Manchester, New Hampshire Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370766",9218,"The President. Well, first of all—[inaudible]—thank you. Thank you. And you got a good little training with a, you know, United States Senator. [Laughter] Hey, folks, thanks an awful lot. I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. Look, it stunned me, the write-in campaign you all did. No, it really did. I was very careful not to be here—[laughter]—— [At this point, the President saluted, then shook hands with, a man seated in the front section of the audience.] Sir. [Laughter] But really, I was stunned. And I was really pleased. By the way, the national Black organizations and Hispanic organizations just endorsed me, as well as—[applause]—AARP. [The President imitated a Southern accent.] They had a meeting down in Atlanta, Georgia. [Laughter] Audience member. [Inaudible]—Georgia? The President. Yes, they did. Anyway. But thank you very, very much. Look, I'm optimistic, not just about winning, but I'm optimistic about the country. I think the country is just wondering—look, people have really been banged around for a while now. And we've—with the help of your delegation—and that's not hyperbole; that's a fact—with the help of your delegation, we got things passed that no one thought we could get passed, from the—from the—everything from the infrastructure bill to veterans bills, all—all the stuff we got passed, and much of it without a single, solitary Republican vote—not one. And it's—but we knew it's going to take a little time for people to begin to see the benefits of it because it's just a big, big country, and there's a lot—— [The President addressed a group of children in the audience.] Hi, how are you? [Laughter] How doing? [Laughter] I'll keep going. Don't stop because of me. [Laughter] What's your name? Audience member. Rosie. The President. Rosie, my name is Joe. Is this your big brother? Is he okay? Hey, man, you know what my dad used to say? ""You've got one job: Keep the boys away from your sister."" [Laughter] That will—but all kidding aside. Look, I think we have enormous opportunities—enormous opportunities. The country is ready to get up and go. And everything from what we've been able to do in a general sense—you know, 15 million new jobs, that's good, but it doesn't really connect you to people, even though they're benefiting from it; inflation down from 9 percent to 3 percent; 800,000 manufacturing jobs. But my dad used to have an expression. He'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your integrity. It's about your dignity. It's about being able to be—look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" And one of the main things I try to do—and I'm going to continue to do, God willing, if we get reelected—is finish the job by continuing to focus on the middle class, because when the middle class does well, the poor have a way up, and the wealthy still do very well. They still do very well. But they've got to start paying their fair share. And I drive my staff crazy because I say: How can we be the finest nation or the greatest nation in the world if we have a second rate education system? How can we be the finest nation in the world if we don't invest in research and development? How can we be the finest nation without the best education system? I mean, just across the board. Health care system—how can we do that? And you know, I think the American people get it. If you take a look at—I know the press is here, and they're all wonderful people. [Laughter] I don't know why they don't like me a lot more than Trump, but they—[laughter]—the way he talks about you guys. But any rate. That's a joke. I'm kidding. I shouldn't even be kidding with you. [Laughter] Shouldn't even be—I'll pay a price for having said that. [Laughter] But look, you know, everything we've done, if you take a look at it—and none of the polling matters much more now. It's way out. But, number two, polling has kind of changed a lot too. It's not nearly as accurate. It's not nearly as capable as it was before because you've got to make 6 zillion calls to get one person on their cell phone, et cetera. But one of the things is that there's three things I want to do. One, I want to restore the soul of this country. When I ran the first time, I meant it. Well, and that sounds like—that sounds like hyperbole, but I just mean basic dignity, basic—just basic sense of dignity and just treating people with respect. I mean, we've—I've been around—I know I don't look it, but I've been around a long while. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, think about it. I've doubt whether those of you who have been around half the time I've been around thought it would ever get to this point in the way we treat one another in politics. It's just not healthy. I—the reason Barack asked me to be his Vice President was because of my background in foreign policy, and I had spent a lot of—an awful lot of time traveling the world and knew almost every major world leader and know them all now as well. And they're wondering about us, when—they're wondering about whether we are the same country we are—have advertised ourselves to be since the end of World War II. There's a lot at stake. And it's about protecting us, not just them. So, when I talk about—everybody wonders why I talk in the middle of a campaign about—about dealing with making sure that Ukraine is taken care of. Well, you know, the message that the President says when he says to Putin, ""Come on, if we—if they don't pay their dues, you just come in and do whatever the hell you want."" You know, you have—I mean, there's things that—anyway. The same thing with regard to dealing with the border. The border—I—the first bill I ever introduced as a—as the President of the United States was essentially what got passed this time out, led by a Republican—by the conservative Republican, who they're vilifying now for having worked out this deal. But look, what we need is we need—is we need to just—an orderly process at the border, not to keep—they're not vermin. They're not scum. They're not people who are all criminals coming. It's just—[applause]. And you know, it's—I think the American people get it, but the way it's being run now is just not—well, I'm going on too long. [Laughter] But look, health care is critically important. I've been fighting from the time I was a kid in the Senate to take on the Big Pharma companies. The idea that it costs $10 to make insulin, $13 to package it all told, and they're selling it for 400 bucks is crazy. It's a rip-off. If you got on Air Force One with me, flew out of here, and I flew you to Toronto, to Berlin, to Rome, to any place in the world and you brought your prescription with you—whatever it is, for whatever product—you're going to pay 40- to 60-percent less in any country you land in for—made by the same company. So it's just about being fair. And the process is, it also cuts the deficit. What we did so far, just reducing the cost of insulin from an average of somewhere around 400 bucks a month to 35 bucks a month—[applause]—well, it's not—it doesn't just help—it doesn't just help the patient. It saved the country $160 billion—$160 billion they're paying out less—because Medicare didn't have to pay it. And the same way with—regarding the Affordable Care Act. You know, 800 bucks, if you have—you have thousands of people here in your State qualifying for it, over—well over 100,000 across the country doing it—more than that, quite frankly—significant more. And the end result of it is that if you didn't have that Affordable Care Act and you had a preexisting condition, you couldn't afford any insurance. So it's just about basic fairness, just basic decency. By the way—I'll stop talking, and I'll take questions, if you want me to. But one of the things that I found interesting is, Trump keeps talking about the deficit. Well, he raised the deficit more in 4 years than any President in American history. We've cut it. We've cut—we've done all this, and we cut the deficit. But it's just about—you know, we've never lived up to, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator,"" et cetera. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it. This guy wants to walk away from it. Listen to what he's saying. Listen to what he wants to do. While I was down in Georgia working on health care and making sure that we had the support of all the minority organizations in the country that we support so strongly, he was with Viktor Orban, who talked about democracy being a problem, and telling him how much he understood him and agreed with him. Come on. I mean—so this is not who we are. We've got to make sure that we communicate that. I'm going to be working like the devil. And I'm looking forward to doing more and more of these events than the big events because this is how I used to campaign. You've campaigned with me before. [Laughter] Audience member. A few times. The President. A few times. But really, it's about—it's just getting to look people in the eye, get their feelings. They tell you the truth when you're talking to them. Anyway. Am I allowed to take questions? [Laughter] Anybody here, the staff?","","",""

Trump (1st Term)","March 09, 2024","Remarks at a Campaign Rally in Rome, Georgia","Donald J. Trump (1st Term), Remarks at a Campaign Rally in Rome, Georgia Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374964",100182,"TRUMP: Hello, Georgia. I'm thrilled to be back in Rome. We did very well in Rome--very well, with thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots. You are amazing. You built this country. You built this country. This has been a tremendous week for our movement. We won big on Super Tuesday.[cheers and applause] They call it Super Tuesday for a reason--we won big. And now we're just days away from officially clinching the Republican nomination for President of the United States of America. [cheers and applause] I want to thank the millions of incredible supporters whose hard work and devotion have led us to this incredible moment in history. You know, this is a movement, the likes of which this country has never seen before. No, no movement even close, and to all Americans, whether you are a Republican, an Independent, or a disillusioned Democrat, of which there are many--all you hadda do is watch that horrible State of the Union, that was the worst President in history, making the worst State of the Union speech in history. [booing] But if you're a disillusioned Democrat, of which there are many today, I extend an open hand, an open invitation, and I ask you to join us on the noble quest of saving our country, saving our country. Together we will turn the page forever on the miserable nightmare of the Biden presidency. What a presidency, what a president, most incompetent president we've ever had. The worst president, the most incompetent, and the most corrupt. Other than that, I think he's doing actually quite a good job--and we will make America great again. [cheers and applause] Two nights ago we all heard Crooked Joe's angry, dark, hate-filled rant of a State of the Union Address. Wasn't it--didn't it bring us together? [imitating Biden's speaking] ""Shraw-ba-dah, bring the country t-t-t-together. I'm gonna bring it together."" No, no. He's a threat to democracy. I will tell you, he's a threat to democracy. Weaponize government. Weaponize the FBI. Weaponize the DOJ. He's a threat to democracy for other reasons also. Number one, he's grossly incompetent. Joe Biden gave the most divisive, partisan, radical and extreme speech ever delivered by a president in that chamber, not even close. Rather than trying to bring our country together, he tried to cling to power by tearing our country apart. He's done nothing. You know what their whole thing is gonna be? ""Go after Trump, go aft-- we have no policy. We didn't do anything. Everything we did turned out so badly. Go after Trump."" And we're ready for it. Are we ready? We're ready. [cheers and applause] Crooked Joe Biden talked about Ukraine before he talked about America. He talked about the size of a Snickers bar. You know--it's probably true about Snickers, they throw a little bit less in. I'd probably do the same thing if I owned that particular company. But can I be honest with you? Who the hell cares about--that's not what the problem is. That's not what the problem is. [cheers and applause] That's not what the--you don't talk about Snickers. You talk about inflation, big league inflation, not that kind of stuff. You talk about the fact that we're no longer energy independent. We were gonna be energy dominant. You talk about, uh, bigger things, we talk about the whole country, as, as opposed to the kind of things he talked. He didn't--I think he took 41 minutes before he gotta the border and then he covered it almost not at all. Uh, the border is the biggest problem. I think it's one of the biggest problems, the greatest threat to the history of our country. [cheers and applause] So it took him 41 minutes, and then he announced a plan to send our brave US military men and women into Gaza to resupply the terrorists of Hamas. [booing] You know what's gonna happen? He wants to build uh billions and billions of dollars, a pier, a nice pier going way into, what happened to the environmental impact statement? Last time I wanted to build a pier, they tie you up forever, right? There's no tying up. But here's the problem. Uh, the bad guys will take over that pier and they'll take every ounce of food and everything else, and then they'll sell it to people that have no money and that it was intended for. We have the stupidest people in the history of our country running things. These are stupid, these are stupid people. I'd like to use a more sophisticated word, but, you know, there are some words that just go-- these are stupid people. Joe Biden should not be shouting angrily at America. America should be shouting angrily at Joe Biden. [cheers and applause] And we should be saying, ""Crooked Joe, you're fired. Get out of here. You're fired. [cheers and applause] You're incompetent. You're incompetent. Get out of here. You're destroying our nation. Get the hell out of here. You're destroying our country, Joe."" He doesn't have a clue. He doesn't even know. He doesn't know he is destroying it. He has no clue. He has no clue, like with, with the documents hoax. How about that? He's not competent to stand trial, but he's allowed to be the president. Okay, figure that one. We don't think he should be standing trail because he's not competent. But as far as being president, that's okay. Right? Figure that one out. I think we'll be taking that one on the campaign trail a little bit. Do you think maybe? [laughter] Only in America can this happen. With your vote we are gonna win the state of Georgia in an epic landslide. [cheers and applause] And, and by the way, I have to tell you that, you know, I've done it twice. We did great the first time, 2016. We did much better the second time, like not even close. And it was rigged. It was rigged. But there has never been the spirit that I've seen this time. 2016 was great, 2020 was better, the spirit--but this blows it away. We came in from the airport, we're 15 minutes away. The lines of people standing along the streets coming up to this building are incredible, incredible. [cheers and applause] On November 5th, the curtain closes on Crooked Joe's corrupt reign, and the sun rises on a brand new day for Georgia and for America. [cheers and applause] Right? [gestures to audience] By far the most disgraceful part of Joe Biden's disservice, it's the divisive and angry speech. W—it's so, so angry. Our great first lady said, ""I think he's very angry."" You know why he's angry? Because he doesn't know what he's doing. He's screaming, screaming, and then coughing, [makes coughing sounds and gesture of covering] ""Ah, a-ha, wow."" And he's always using the right hand. He shakes his hand, then he gets off the stage. Did you notice nobody wanted to shake his hand? [laughter] I wouldn't. I'm a great American, but I don't know if I wanna go there. Nah, he's always coughing into his hand. And that's--it's not a real cough, it's a nervous habit. It's gotta stop. That's it's--because there was no real cough. He just goes, [makes gagging coughing sounds] ""Agh, agh. Yagh ahg."" [laughter] And then you turn to fake news, CNN. Oh, their light just went off. Their light just went off. [booing] [walks away from podium] The red light just went off. What do you think of that, Jim? Dammit! That's my fault, I waited too long. I--you have to hit 'em fast--before they can turn it off. No, it just went off. That's all right. And they'll say the speech was brilliant; not since FDR--you know, FDR was a great orator. Beautiful--tone, beautiful. He was born at a very patrician area, to put it mildly. Very rich, very patrician, beautiful accent, beautiful words. He was a great speaker. And they said, ""Not since FDR has a speech been so beautifully delivered."" Do you believe this? [booing] No. Do you believe this? I think Marjorie [Marjorie Taylor Green] believes it because she was there. She saw. [Trump laughs] It's incredible, that DNC. I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what, you take a look at MSDNC, how evil they are. They're evil. They're sick. They shouldn't even be allowed to do what they do because it's so corrupt. They shouldn't be allowed to do it. They are fighting me. And to think that I had The Apprentice on NBC and I did so great for them. I said, before the election, long before I started in, I said, well, one thing for sure, I did so much, I made so much money for NBC, they hadn't had a number one show in years. They were dying. And that idiot, Jeff Zucker was running it poorly. He was running it to the ground. And I came on and I gave them ratings like they haven't had in years. And when I said, I'm gonna leave the show now, they wanted me to extend. Instead, they got Arnold Schwarzenegger. What happened is, I said, ""No, I'm gonna leave because—"" [pauses and comments to crowd:] Boy, are you quiet when you hear this one, because you haven't heard this before. This isn't part of the repertoire. [laughter] Right? Right. Bert? [laughter]t. Governor Bert Jones] You haven't heard this one. But you hear how quiet, it's almost like when I do The Snake, it's very quiet. It's so qui--you could hear a pin drop. But, it's true. I said, one thing that's going to happen, if I decide to leave the show, and they wanted me to extend, they were offering me three years, fi--. Anything I wanted. I said, ""No, I'm gonna run for President."" Don't forget, we did it for 14 seasons. That's enough, right? But I said, we're gonna run. And, it's hard to give up prime time and a lot of money, no matter how rich, it's a lot of money you make, but you give a prime time television, Thursday nights, uh it was a hard thing to do, but I said, ""No, I'm gonna run for President."" And they were so upset, and they said, ""No, no, no."" And--I decided to do it. And they said, ""Who do you think we should use?"" I said, ""I have no idea. That's your business, not mine."" And they said, ""What do you think of Arnold Schwarzenegger?"" I said, ""Hey, he's a movie star. Maybe he'll do well."" The guy got killed! He couldn't get anything. You know, flies watched, flies. And the show was canceled. Remember they tried Martha Stewart, too. How did that work out? She blamed me. She said, ""It's your fault"" that she failed doing The Appr--I said, why? She couldn't tell us why. I don't know. She never figured that one out. But they used her. But they used Arnold Schwarzenegger, big movie star. And he failed so badly. Actually, they asked me, because I own it with Mark Burnett, right? Mark Burnett's great. And I own it. And I--they said, ""Well, you own it so you would like to have it do well."" I said, ""I would."" They said, ""Would you rather have it do unbelievably, with, Arnold—"" a big movie star comes in,"" Arnold, Schwarzenegger, so would you rather have it fail?"" I thought about it for a little while and I said, ""Honestly, I'd much rather have it fail because it makes me look better."" Right? Right. [laughter] I'm not lookin' for him to come in and top Trump. Naw. It worked out just fine. He failed. It was like uh, a total disaster. But I did it for 14 seasons. And I said to NBC, ""Uh, you know I respect you guys."" I liked him. I mean, I liked wha-- But the bosses came up, they tried to talk me. Five guys came up and they wanted to talk with, they call them suits, but the top suits, the top top. And I just said, ""No, I've decided I'm gonna run for President."" ""But you won't win. It's impossible to win. Nobody's ever done that before."" There's never been a person that ran for president that wasn't either a politician or a general, I think it's 92% of politicians and 8% were generals. Did anybody know these little facts? These little facts of wisdom? So you had to be a general, I guess an admiral and all. But there were no admirals, 8% generals and 92, think of that, 92% politicians. I said, ""I don't care. I mean, it doesn't matter to me. I'm gonna give it a shot."" And I announced and immediately went to number one and stayed there for a long time. Remember I had center of stage ,and then I got angry because I said, ""No, no, I want to be in the center. I don't want to be tied for the center. Those guys don't come close."" So we hadda have a different number. So it didn't have to be 10, it had to be nine or it had to be 11. It had to be something, but it, it couldn't be an even number. And they got angry at me. I said, ""No, I'm not gonna do it."" So then they ended up doing what I said. But right from the beginning it worked. And then I got on television and they asked me that horrible, horrible question, remember? And I said, ""Oh am I dead."" That's the first question I ever got. Megan Kelly, may she rest in peace. [laughter] She's sort of making a career by pretending she likes me. And then, so what happened is she asked me that horrible question about women. Women love me. You know, I protect women. I protected, I protect. [cheers and applause] They talk about suburban housewives— And look at that [points to the audience]. These are suburban housewives from North Carolina. They followed me. This is their 117th rally. You believe that? One hundred and seventeen. I don't know what the hell their husbands are doing. They're home at alone saying, ""Is my wife--okay?"" No. I mean, we're not so far. But you know, when they go out to Texas 'n California, there's like 40 of them and they look great, but I don't think the husbands can be too-- are your husbands happy about this? Are they okay with? Yes. Well, you have very nice husbands, I'll tell you. But, uh, it was an amazing phenomenon and I do protect women. Look, they talk about suburban housewives. I believe I'm doing well--the polls are all rigged. Of course lately they haven't been rigged because I'm winning by so much, I always say. Disregard that statement. I love the polls very much. [laughter] We're beating him by so much. But with the suburban, they always say suburban housewives, they want something that's very important. Security. They don't want illegal immigrants coming into our country. [cheers and applause] They don't want illegal immigrants knocking on their front door and saying, ""I'm gonna use your kitchen, and I'm gonna use your bedroom. And there's not a damn thing."" And that's the nice ones. Okay? That's the nice ones. They want safety, they want security. And that's what I provide. I had the safest border in the history of our country. Now we have the worst border in the history of our world. So we went out and we did it and we went to number one almost immediately, right? I think immediately. I think the first week or something was, you know, I wasn't given credit because it was only one day of the week. So I said, ""Oh, I didn't start off too well."" They said, ""Well, you were only given credit for a half a day."" I said, ""Oh, that's okay. So let's see how I do."" We went to number one immediately. From the day we came down that beautiful escalator in Trump Tower with our first lady, who people love our first lady, I wanna tell you. [cheers and applause] She says ""Hello."" We went to number one, and we never le—we never left. And then we hadda beat, we hadda beat--I don't call her crooked anymore. I use that term for Joe. Joe's crooked, and uh I don't call Hillary anything. I don't even think about her anymore, to be, honestly. But we went to number one. And then we weren't supposed to win the election, and that's what they hate me for because I won an election that the Republicans were not supposed to win. They weren't. We weren't supposed to win it, right Jim? But we won it, Jim. Jim Jordan knew. Do we love Jim Jordan, by the way? [cheers and applause sustained] [gestures to Jordan] Stand up. Every day Joe Biden is deliberately releasing gang members and military-aged men into our communities by the tens of thousands, knowing full well that his policies will cost countless innocent lives. I'm not sure he does know, if you wanna know the truth, because I really don't. I don't think he's a good person. I don't think he's a nice guy. I think he's a corrupt individual. But I don't think, I don't think--and it has nothing to do with age. I know people from 80 to 90. I know one man from 80. He was a loser all his life. When he turned, it's true. When he turned 80, he made a billion dollars doing something, from 80 to 90. Amazing. And I know other people, over 90. It's not an age thing. It's a competence thing. It's, it's uh, it's a competence thing. They gotta stop. They do the age thing and they always have me as his age. I'm four years younger, so four years is a lot, but it doesn't matter. They do the age thing to try and get Trump, let's get Trump, always, they never talk about his competence. He's grossly incompetent. Don't you understand that? The question is whether or not he's going to get to the starting gate. I can only hope. You know, I challenged him to a debate. And he said, his person who's really a wonderful spokesp--his press secretary, how good is she? [booing] She actually didn't know what to say, but I do, and I challenge him right now. He's at another part of your state where he's really said some bad things today, and we'll get into that. He said some really bad things. But one of the lives--that was taken from us--was a incredible 22-year old nursing student right here in Georgia. Laken Riley, right? Look at the signs. Wow, wow, wow, wow. From the time she was in the first grade, Laken's dream was to spend her life caring for others. And I met her beautiful mother and family backstage, sister, friends, some of her friends, her roommate. They said she was, like the best. She was always the best. They admit that she was the best, and she was the first in her class. She was gonna be the best nurse. She was the best nursing student. She was always the best. She was the brightest light in every room they told me. And she was the whole world to her parents and to her sister-- just uh, to the whole family. Incredible. Then the unthinkable happened. 16 days ago, Laken went out for a morning jog. She was in great shape. She wanted to keep herself that way, and she never came back. Never came back. They knew something was wrong. An illegal alien criminal who Joe Biden intentionally released into our country has been-- and because he's released--tens of thousands of people like this, tens of thousands. Because you know, they come from jails, and they come from mental institutions. [booing] He released them into our country. Biden has implemented a formal policy that illegal aliens who intrude into the United States are granted immunity from deportation. Thus, when this monster showed up at our border, he was set free immediately under the program that Crooked Joe created. I call it Free to Kill. It's Free to Kill. On Thursday night, Joe Biden was confronted over this cruel policy. And what did Crooked Joe reply? And Marjorie, I have to say, you were very brave in trying to bring up a point. [cheers and applause] Very brave. Very brave. That takes courage. That's not easy to do. Stand up and do that. That's not easy to do. Marjorie. We understand that. He got Laken's name wrong, calling her Lincoln. No. Mixing her up with the football coach, right? He got the name wrong, Lincoln. And when he asked, ""What about all the legal citizens who kill people?"" That's what he said, ""What about all the legal citizens?"" When he was asked, ""What about all the legal?"" In other words, making excuses. Then, just moments ago, I don't know if you heard, because you've all been waiting on line for two days--but just moments ago, this was just before coming up. They just told me prior to what I'm doing right now, that Joe went on television and apologized for calling Laken's murderer ""an illegal,"" he didn't want to call him illegal. He apologized. [booing] He said he should have called him an undocumented, not ""an illegal."" And he wanted to apologize. He wanted to apologize. And-- Well, they have a new name too. They have a new name that's even worse. They have a new name. You know what the new name is? Neighbor. They want to call 'em ""neighbor."" They want to call 'em another name. Did you ever hear the other one? Newcomer. A newcomer to our country. Are we—are we going crazy or what? Is this country going crazy? How 'bout that one? Newcomer. The newcomer? No, he was illegal. And I say he was an illegal alien. He was an illegal immigrant. He was an illegal migrant, and he shouldn't have been in our country, and he never would've been under the Trump policy. [cheers and applause] And Biden should be apologizing for apologizing to this killer. Joe Biden, and you understand what's happening here, Joe Biden has no remorse. He's got no regret. He's got no empathy, no compassion or worst of all, he has no intention of stopping the deadly invasion that stole precious Laken's beautiful American life. We are profoundly honored to be joined today by the family and loved ones of Laken and some of her great friends. I met them. They're so incredible. The whole—the whole group is incredible. To Laken's parents, John and Allison and her sister Lauren, her roommate, Connolly, and to all of those who loved Laken, the hearts of hundreds of thousands and indeed, millions and millions of Americans and people worldwide, they're shattered alongside of your beautiful hearts. We share your grief. We share your grief. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. I know how tough it is. It's so tough. We vow to keep Laken's memory alive for as long as we are here on this earth, and we take comfort that she is now home with God in heaven. And I want to thank you and thank you for, thank you for being here. Incredible. I know how tough it is. Incredible. What Joe Biden has done on our border is a crime against humanity and the people of this nation for which he will never be forgiven. That's a very hard thing. We're gonna fix it. We're gonna fix it fast. We're gonna have the largest deportation in history, [cheers and applause] but what a tremendous shame that this could have happened in our country. What a shame. Laken Riley would be alive today if Joe Biden had not willfully and maliciously eviscerated the borders of the United States and set loose thousands and thousands of dangerous criminals into our country. To her family tonight: I promise you, I will demand justice for Laken. Justice for Laken. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Incredible. I will fight like no one has ever fought before to ensure that what happened to this American daughter, this incredible, incredible American, that this never happens to any other daughter or anyone else ever again. We will do everything we can that it doesn't happen again. And you know it will because unfortunately, we have so many people allowed into our country that shouldn't be, but we're gonna get it down to a trickle. We're not gonna let this go on. Our country is being destroyed by an incompetent president, and we're not gonna, we're not gonna ah let this happen. I mean, the good thing about his uh speech, if you want to call his rant the other night, he probably did well enough that he's not gonna be replaced on the ballot, because they were talking about replacing him. And I said you know he got through it, barely, but he got through it. I think he's possibly gonna make it. Nobody thought he was. I, I sort of didn't think. I guess maybe I still don't think. I mean, when that's the best that a party can do, we're in big trouble. And you know, they always talk about, it's so interesting. I watch these uh criminals back there, the press, [gestures toward media] look at them. [booing] Look at how many of them. That's a lot of people. That's a lot of people. Wow. Uh, I always say they should endorse me because I'm the best thing that ever happened to their ratings. They should endorse me. [cheers and applause] But I say it and I say it all the time. I say, we have to have a free press. We have to have an honest press in this country. They're like the police. We need our police. We need an honest press. We need free and fair elections. We don't have free and fair elections. We have very corrupt elections. And we need borders. And we had the safest border in the history of our country. Now we have most unsafe border in the history of the world. But we need a free and fair press. And they're totally wise to you, [gestures again toward media] the people are wise to these people, and I'm not saying all of them. I'd say about 94.2% are bad. If you say--to all Americans--Americans, I will seal the border. I'm gonna do it, and I will stop this invasion. I'm going to do it. I will stop the killing. I will stop the bloodshed. I will end the agony of our people, the plunder of our cities, the sacking of our towns, the violation of our citizens, and the conquest of our country. They're conquering our country. These people are conquering our country. They're horrible people. You know, we have China, we have Russia, we have Kim Jong Un. We have all sorts of countries out there. But if you have a really capable president--like me, I mean, I will tell you-- you were very safe. [cheers and applause] You were very safe. But the real problem is not from them. A competent president can handle 'em. You can say, ""Really? You're gonna do that to us? We're gonna tariff the hell out of you. We're gonna do this."" Believe me, I had 'em all in good shape. They were all--you were never in any trouble. Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Tough guy, tough guy. But we had a great relationship. You know, they hate when they say that. You know why? Because you were very safe. You had a lot of nuclear weapons. And, you know, you have Putin now talking nuclear all the time, don't you? You know why? Because he knows we have an idiot as a President, and he can get away with that. He can get away with that. But the biggest threat we have, it's the threat from within. It's the radical left lunatics that we have in our country—[cheers and applause] That's a much bigger threat than outside threats, I will tell you right now. We can handle the outside pretty easily if you're smart. If you're stupid, they'll continue to rip you off. But the bigger threat is from what we have inside. Remember I used to say, if we don't start changing, we're gonna be Venezuela on steroids. That's where we're handling—we're heading right to it. I have a—you remember, Trump was right about everything--the hat, ""Trump was right."" I don't want to be right about these things. You have to be careful, too, of World War III. I'm not gonna let that happen. You're not gonna have it, but, right now, you're very close to a World War on this whole mess that we're in. When I left, we had no problem. Everybody was--respecting us. They respected the President, and they respected the country. We had no problem. Now we have problems all over the place. I had dinner last night with a great gentleman from Hungary, Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban. Very, very tough. Some people don't like him because he is very tough. And they were interviewing him two months ago. He said it again yesterday, actually. I appreciate it. It's very nice. It's good if you're running for office, I guess. But he said, uh, ""The problem with America is they need Trump back as president. When Trump was president, there were none of these problems. Israel wouldn't have been attacked. Ukraine and Russia wouldn't be fighting."" I knew Potin [sic]--I know him very well. No way he was going in. No way Putin was going in. Putin would have gone in under any circumstances, but then they gave him added incentive. The things Biden said were the exact opposite things. I said, ""He's gonna talk this guy into going in."" You listen to what, the way he talked. He had no idea what he was doing. And then you look at what happened to energy. Energy went up so high. Russia's one of the biggest in the world for energy, so they had now so much money to do. They wouldn't have had it at $40 a barrel. At a hundred dollars a barrel, they were making a fortune, the only one ever to make a fortune doing a war. And that's what happened. This guy is a disaster, and he has to be taken out. You're going to end up--If he's not relieved of his office on November 5th, we have done one of the great disservices to humanity, because he is not capable to be your president. Not capable. [cheers and applause] You'll end up in a World War as sure as you're sitting or standing there. We have standing room only. The press hates to say that, you know. They never talk about the size. We haven't had an empty seat in years. Jim Jordan knows that. A long time ago, I did one in Ohio and Jim said, ""Man, it is 10,000 people outside. They can't--"" That was the beginning, right, Jim? And we saved Whirlpool, and we saved some great companies up there, and now they're doing good. They had little problems, like they weren't allowed to have water go into their washing machines. You know, minor, little problems. But we took care of it. We took care of uh, the dumping. They were dumping from South Korea and from China. They were dumping washing machines, dryers, and we took care of it. And they love us up there. We love them. And they love this whole family [pointing to Jordan]. I tell you, they love this whole family up there. But we have to straighten out our country, and we have to do it fast. And we don't have that much time anymore. You know, even seven months is a long time. We're waiting. And it's at the end of seven months. In other words, it's closer to eight than it is to seven. And, uh, the destruction that they are doing to our country, this is a long time. This is a very risky period. This is the most dangerous period in the history of our country, in my opinion. It's the most dangerous time. And that's because of nuclear weapons and other types of weapons that are so powerful, but nuclear weapons, but other types, too, that are so powerful. This is no longer Army tanks going back and forth, shooting each other. This is big stuff. And we have a man that, ah, has"," no clue. If I said to him, ""Give me the definition of MAGA."" [impersonating Biden] ""Arrgh. Why do you ask that?"" I said, "" It's make America great again, Joe."" He wouldn't be able to tell you. ""We have to stop MAGA."" How about where he goes, ""We have to stop MAGA. We will stop MAGA. We will stop."" I said, ""What does MAGA mean? I don't know, really. Tell me, what does it mean? Make America great again. Let's stop that."" That's what they're doing. They are stopping it. You know, if they use their genius--because they are a genius at cheating at elections and things, but they're not a genius on policy or common sense. They have no common sense. But, if they use their ability, their genius on making America great again, we wou--I probably wouldn't have ever run. I probably woulda never run. I wouldn't have to. I'd be now lounging on some beautiful beach someplace, or doing something like he does, but he does it during his presidency. Somebody said he looks great in a bathing suit, right? [laughter] And, you know--when he was in the sand and he was having a hard time lifting his feet through the sand, 'cause you know sand is heavy. They figured three solid ounces per foot, but sand is a little heavy,. And he's sitting in a bathing suit. Look, at 81-- do you remember Cary Grant? How good was Cary Grant, right? I don't think Cary Grant, he was good. I don't know what happened to movie stars today. We used to have Cary Grant and Clark Gable and all these people. Today we have--I won't say names, because I don't need enemies. I don't need enemies. I got enough enemies. But Cary Grant was, like Michael Jackson once told me, ""The most handsome man, Trump, in the world."" ""Who?"" ""Cary Grant."" Well, we don't have that anymore-- but Cary Grant at 81 or 82, going on a hundred. This guy, he's 81, going on a hundred. Cary Grant wouldn't look too good in a bathing suit, either. And he was, he was pretty good-looking, right? He wouldn't loo--if this guy went to the beach and he enjoyed himself, and he left our border policies alone, we had the strongest wst--remain in Mexico, catch-and-release in Mexico, building the wall, the Mexican Army, 28,000 soldiers protecting our border. If he just left it alone, he coulda stayed at the beach, and everybody would've said, ""Boy, is he lookin' good."" But he doesn't look good. Somebody--he's got a consultant, you know--we all have consultants, but you have to think for yourself a little bit. And some consultants said, ""You know, I think the president would look good on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. You don't go to the beach there. I don't think that looks good."" Are the voters happy when they see a president all week long at a beach? I don't think—[booing] Typically, typically that's not a good look. You'd like to see a president who works a little bit, right? But if he would've left our policies in place and our policies on energy, now I will say he brought them back because he was getting killed. So he let them drill more, but as soon as this election were over, should the unthinkable happen, he will stop all of the drilling. He's only doing it because he was getting absolutely killed. So he went back to the Trump drilling. But even at that, he gave up ANWR, the biggest site ever in the world, probably bigger than Saudi Arabia, some peop--that's in Alaska, ANWR. So it's a shame what's happening to our country. It's so sad. When I'm with people, and we start talking about it, and they're from other countries, it's embarrassing. On day one of my new administration, I will terminate every open border policy of the Biden administration, and we will use every tool at our disposal to rid our country of the monsters who Joe Biden set loose to threaten and kill innocent Americans. Because what we just discussed is happening to many people. Many, many people. People are being killed every single day by these monsters. How about New York? They just put military on the subways. Military. Because the illegals, as he refuses to say, the migrants were harming passengers. Ya, I mean, think of it. You're gonna work for years and years. You're an accountant, you're a lawyer, you're a doctor, you're a carpenter, you're goin' to work on the subways. And now they're like a military installation. And you know why? Because the migrants are hurting people. They talk about the beautiful dream of migrants. It sounds so nice, like in a fairy tale book. But some of these people are monsters, a big percentage of. If you go to El Salvador, Honduras, if you go to--numerous of the countries, but we're really talking all over the world. The other day from Africa, the Congo, they had numerous prisoners caught from the Congo. The good news is they all make our prisoners look like very nice people, because our people are much nicer. Our prisoners are vicious, horrible people in many cases, in most cases, perhaps. But you know what? When you look at the people that are being allowed to come--all over the world, they're emptying their prisons. They're emptying their mental institutions into the United States of America. What can be good about that? What? Is there any reason that that can be good? CROWD MEMBER: No!! TRUMP: They're probably thinking they can vote, but they cheat. So they don't really have to do that. They can do it without doing, because they cheat so much. But, uh, what can be good about that? And how can that even be good politically? I think there's a movement. I think one of the reasons--I think you like me the same. You had four great years. We had the greatest economy in history. You had four great years and people looked at-- [cheers and applause], But, I think you like me the same. Let's say you like me the same. You know, they always like to say, ""Two very unpopular people are running."" I'm not unpopular. I'm at 92 or 94% in the Republican Party. Ronald Reagan was at 86%. [cheers and applause] It's fake news. [gestures to media] These are fake news people. Is that right, Marjorie? No, they always like to equate me with this guy. ""Two very unpopular people are running for office, very unpop--"" I said, ""Why am I unpopular? I just knocked off 12 people in the quickest time that it's ever happened."" I don't know if you know that. It's the fastest that's ever-- It's never happened that fast. [cheers and applause] And in Iowa, in New Hampshire, in South Carolina, against a governor of South Carolina, in Nevada, every single state I ran in, we won by a margin that was a substantial record. In Iowa, we won by the highest margin in history, times two. We were double the highest margin. In New Hampshire, I got the most votes in the history of the state of New Hampshire. Now think of this for a second. New Hampshire, and it's up there in, you know, Kennedy territory, right? JFK ran. I got more votes than JFK. A lot of great people, historic people ran, and that's in either party. I got more votes than anybody in either party. In Nevada, I got unbelievable, we got ninety—ninety-eight percent of the caucus votes and then won the primary, too. Even though I wasn't running in the primary, I won. I wasn't even running in it, because it didn't matter--because it didn't equate to delegates, right? And then we go to other states. And--but we go to South Carolina and against a popular and competent, but very nasty person, but a competent person, uh, we won in a record. It wasn't even close. It wasn't even close. Think of it. And then we had this beautiful, magnificent couple of states, which by the way, we won, but then we had our 15 states. Super Tuesday. Every state was like in a record. I think in California, was close to ninety percent to nine percent, and one, one percent undecided. I said, ""Who are the people that are undecided?"" One percent. They always have undecided. Ya know, tha-- And I have to say that, because they'll say, ""Oh, he doesn't add well. It was 90 to nine."" No, no. There were some people undecided, for the fake news. It's a problem. If I have fun and I want to be a little sarcastic, because I'm a somewhat sarcastic person. I have humor. You know why I have humor? Because if I didn't, and I'm looking at what this guy has done to our country, you have to have a little humor. But sometimes I'll imitate, because he can never find his way off a stage. You know that, right? He makes a speech that lasts for about two and a half minutes, and then, [gestures] ""aanh, aanh."" Then he always goes--do you ever notice, the weirdest thing, he goes, ""Tha, thank you."" [Trump pivots to his right, leans forward and point his index finger.] And he points. [laughter] No, he always points. And then he starts walking, and they're waving him to the other--it's the other step. And he goes around and doesn't know what the hell he is doing, he's lost. Then he'll walk off the back of the stage where there's no stair, and fall down. [laughter] No, I, I mean, you know--but here's the problem. Whenever I imitate that, they put me on, saying I couldn't get off the stage. So I have to be very careful. When I substitute Barack Hussein Obama--has anybody ever heard of Barack Hussein Obama? [booing] And I use his name and say-- [booing] And I say, ""Our president, Barack Hussein Obama,"" meaning who's calling the shots? Does everyone understand it? The fake news says, ""He doesn't know the name of our President. He doesn't know it's Joe Biden. He must be cognitively impaired."" I'm not cognitively--and you know what? When I am, you're gonna know it. You're gonna be the first people. I know my people. You'll say, ""All right, Trump, you did a good job. Get the hell out of here. That's it. That's it."" [laughter] Naw, these are very dishonest people. No, I called my wife. I said, ""Baby, how was that? Just tell me. How good was I tonight?"" She watches it, like--she loves it, right? She said, ""uh, You were good, but it's a little embarrassing."" ""Why?"" ""They showed you couldn't find the stairs on the stage."" I said, ""They did that to me. They did that."" Because it's almost impossible. These things--in this case, we only have four stairs. It's a small platform. Look, I have one there, believe it or not, and one here, one there. He had three, and he can't find 'em, and they're right alongside of each other, and they all work, you know? I don't know. Government must have built it, because you got one platform, and you have stairs all over the place. Built by government. [laughter] a Crazy. So I have to be very careful. I can't be sarcastic. Can't be fun. You can't mix names. Purposely mix names, you know--purposely. In his State of the Union this week, Crooked Joe told a total fairy tale about the economy. But the fact is, under Biden, we have a three-year inflation rate of almost 50%. Under me, you had no inflation. You had no inflation. Under Bidenomics, the United States has lost 284,000 good, full-time jobs in the past year, and replaced them with hundreds of thousands of part-time jobs and a lot of government jobs. That's not fair. I could do that, too. Let's hire some more people. Make me look good. In addition, virtually 100% of all jobs created under Biden have gone to foreign-born workers. How do you feel about that? Good? CROWD: Booing! TRUMP: And I'll tell you this: the biggest problem that you're gonna see from all of these millions and millions, I think the number is 15 million people, already, I think it'll be 18 to 20 million people by the time we get rid of this guy. And, the biggest--think of it, that's bigger than New York State. Uh, I think it's gonna be close to 20 million people. That's my prediction. But I think it's already 15 million people: Black people, Hispanic people, Asian people, and unions. Unions are gonna suffer. I mean, I'm all for everybody. I'm for the worker. But unions, they should endorse Trump, because I'm closing our border good and tight. And if you're gonna come into our country, you're coming in legally. You're gonna come into our country legally. In February alone, nearly 1 million jobs held by native-born Americans disappeared by one—think of that: You lost a million jobs. Black people, that's who lost the jobs. Hispanic people, that's who lost the jobs. That's why--we just had a poll come out. Now, it doesn't sound great, but it is great relative. A guy, a stiff like Mitt Romney, I think he had 4% of the Black vote. I had as of this poll today, Marjorie, 28%. [cheers and applause] If that's the case, this election is over, if that's the case. If that's the case, I'll ask some of our great congresspeople. We have great ones. We're gonna introduce 'em in a second, but why don't we just call the election over? Because at 28%, and I hope that stays that way. But you know what? And I hope it goes up higher. It should be much higher--honestly, it should be a hundred percent of the Black people should vote for Trump, because I did more for Black people than any president other than Abraham Lincoln. It's true. [cheers and applause] It's true. I did more than any president other than Abraham Lincoln. Think of it, criminal justice reform. I took care of the Black colleges and universities. They would come up to Washington f--after three years, I said, ""Why do you guys keep coming back?"" One of them, I got friendly with some of 'em, really good people. They said, ""Every year, we come back looking for money."" They do a great job. Black colleges and universities, they have very little money. And then you look at Harvard and these maniacs, and they have billions and billions of dollars. Very unfair. We're gonna have to look into that whole situation. We're gonna have to. [cheers and applause] And Elise [Stefanik]did a very good job when she destroyed that person, the big plagiarizer from Harvard. I think she--did she plagiarize every document she ever wrote? I think so. The only thing she had going for her was nice glasses, if you like that look. [laughter] No. Elise, Elise did a fantastic job, we all know that. She was amazing, and--it really revealed what they're all about. But I took care of the Black colleges, universities, opportunity zones. Tim, does everybody know Tim Scott? [cheers and applause] So I shouldn't say he'll get angry, but I tell him this all the time. So, you know, when we win, and people come on, and many people, as soon as you win, I, I have calls from people that you wouldn't believe. People that were so nasty to me, now they're going, ""Sure, we'd love to come over and make amends. You know, I've always felt you were the best candidate. I think you're fantastic."" You know people that were with DeSanctimonious, they were with other people. Well, I'm not gonna use that name anymore. It's not respectful. Let's call him Ron DeSanctus. People, people that were with DeSanctus, were with, uh, Nikki. They were with 'er. Now they're calling, saying, ""Sir, congratulations. Uhh, I've been so busy, sir. I haven't had time to make the call. But now that I'm freed up a little bit, would it be possible for me to come? I'd like to support."" I said, ""I thought you were with DeSanctus."" ""Oh, ha ha ha, not really, sir. Those were false reports."" Great comprehension [points to his head]. Always had great compre--, great memory. Oh. I said, ""Oh, no, no, you were with 'im. Let's just look it up."" The great thing about--one of the only good things about the internet, you press a button, and it gives you the whole history of some guy. But they're all calling me, Jim [Jordan], and they're all saying, ""Sir, I'd love to get,--"" I'll give you names. I'd love to reveal 'em right now, but I'll give you names that you wouldn't believe. ""We've gotta stop Trump. He's an insurrectionist."" Then two weeks later, ""Sir, I'd love to be part of the campaign. I think I could really have—"" These are phony people. So I need—ninety percent of them, we won't take back. And it could be a hundred. It could be a hundred. [cheers and applause] But with your vote, we will throw out Bidenomics, and we will reinstate MAGAnomics, MAGAnomics, right? [cheers and applause] I have to explain to the audience, because I figure, what the hell? It's a Saturday afternoon. We have a little time. You know where I'm going later? I'm gonna the UFC fights. You know why? You know why? It's the closest thing I can see that's uh, really reflective of the election process that we have in this country, the UFC fights. [laughter] That may be a little tamer than the election business, right? But I'll be gonna the UFC fights with some friends, and uh, I look forward to that. Dana White, he's done a great job. I look forward to that. [cheers and applause] Oh, I hope he doesn't run for office against me. No, he's done a fantastic job. He, uh, he likes that—No he likes that because it's an easier business than politics. There's nothing like this. But I have to say that we have a country with tremendous potential, tremendous potential. And if we turn that potential and use that potential, we're gonna come back. A lotta people think we can't come back. It's too far down the line. It's not. If we don't win this election, it is. I don't think it can ever come back. It's never gonna come back. It's too much, too much. But we have tremendous people in the country, tremendous spirit. As I said, it's the greatest spirit I've ever seen, and I've done to it, this is my third time. I'm gonna have to win it three times. [cheers and applause] Three times. But we're gonna turn it around. And we will cancel Biden's work permits for illegals and protect American jobs for American workers. We will immediately end Biden's war on American energy, and we will end his inflation catastrophe, and we will drill, baby, drill, right? [cheers and applause] Yeah, I gotta s—I gotta interrupt. You know, the fake news will say, ""Oh, he goes from subject to s--."" No, you have to be very smart to do that. Ah, you gotta be very smart. You know what it is? It's called spot-checking. You're thinking about something when you're talking about some'n else, [gestures in a circle with each sound] bop bop bop bop bop bop bop. And then you get back to the origin--. And they go, ""Holy shit. Did you see what he did?"" [laughter] That's a--it's called intelligence. But, so I have a problem, because we get so much television coverage, and look at the size. There's never been rallies like this. You know, we get--I had 100,000, 105,000 people, depending. We wanted a much bigger room than this. This is the biggest room you could get. We didn't want to have rain on you. We have a lot of people outside that wanted to get in. But we have--but every place is packed. The problem is I've got front-row Joes over here. And I've got the most beautiful women in the world, in my opinion, from North Carolina, these, these 40 incredible women, and they come to so many--shows. They're up to 117. I won't even tell you how many front-row—front row Joes, close to 200. And here's the problem. I feel I have an obligation to the super-fans. So Marjorie, I have to make different speeches all the time. Do you ever notice? They're never really the same. And to do that, you have to be very smart, and you have to have a great imagination for--putting the right stuff in. Now, a lot of politicians, I know a politician, he's a good politician, he's made the same exact speech word for word for, I would say, a good 10 years. He goes into a room, [makes robotic sound} bah bah bah bahbah. He can't get himself into any trouble. You know people like that, Jim? Yeah? [points to Jim Jordan and laughs] Yes, he's saying that. Too many, most of them. But we have to, we have to give a little action for these people. So we're telling you some stories tonight, because we have to do that. But they'll say, ""Oh, he was wandering. He must be cognitively imbalanced."" No, I'd like to see these guys do it. [gestures to media] Let's do a little IQ test. Let's do an IQ test. [cheers and applause] And by the way, and I said it before, but officially, for the good of our nation, it is time for crooked Joe Biden and myself to debate. We have to debate. It's for the good of our nation. [cheers and applause] I say that for another reason. Because I saw in the Washington Post today, the Washington Post, ugh, a lot of terrible paper. The good news, it's losing so much money that even a rich person isn't that stupid that they're gonna keep it going. But the Washington Post, some real lightweight journalist, quote journalist, said, ""Biden wants to debate Trump, but Trump is not available. He doesn't want to do it."" Can you believe this? So officially to you, Washington Post, and you know the reporter I'm talkin' about, they make it up. They say, Biden wants to debate me ohh, he just wants to do it, but I don't want to do it. No, no, just the opposite, as he knows. These are very dishonest people. They're so bad for our country. I wanna debate Biden, because I think it's important for the American people to hear what's going on. And how can you destroy our country like you're doing it? [cheers and applause] So officially, I wanna debate crooked Joe Biden. Anytime, anywhere, anyplace, I'll debate. [cheers and applause] But it's no wonder that Joe Biden and his thugs are so desperate to stop us. They know that we are the only ones who can stop them. We're the only ones. There's nobody else. Nobody else. We're gonna stop people. We're gonna turn our country around. We're gonna make our country so powerful, so great. That's why they're weaponizing law enforcement for high-level election interference against Joe Biden's top and only political appointment [sic], a guy named me. It's a guy named me. [cheers and applause] Joe Biden and the fascists—the fascists--that control him are the real threat to democracy, remember that. I'm not the threat to democracy. I'm stopping the threat to democracy. They're the threat to democracy. [cheers and applause] As an example--you read about this. Can you believe this? Sometimes it's not good to be rich. I just posted a ninety-one million dollar bond, ninety-one million on a fake story, totally made-up story. Think of it, 91 million. I could say things about what it would cost normally. Ninety-one million based on false accusations made about me by a woman that I knew nothing about, didn't know, never heard of. I know nothing about her. She wrote a book. She said things. And when I denied it, I said, ""It's so crazy. It's false."" I got sued for defamation. That's where it starts. And this is Democrat operatives. Her lawyer's a big Democrat operative. The judge was a disaster, but Democrat operatives funding and directing her. They gave her the money to pursue the case. They changed the law. New York is a very corrupt place, and this is killing New York, because companies are leaving because they don't wanna get caught in this bind. They changed the law that 'lowed, allowed women to go back, like unlimited, unlimited. And she went back and she said, ""Yeas ah, the mid-'90s, maybe. I don't know. I had no idea when."" Nothing, she knew nothing. She went on Anderson Cooper. She went Anderson Cooper, and she was saying all these wonderful things. And then there was a commercial break, and then she said horrible things after the commer--. I wonder what happened there. But it was before a federal Democrat, Trump-deranged judge. His name is Lewis Kaplan, an angry man. He screamed at my lawyer, screamed at 'er saying, ""We're gonna essentially put you in jail,"" because she was incensed that this could be happening. He treated me like a common criminal. He's a terrible person, a terrible judge, and he's a disgrace to what's happening in New York. Think of it. I just posted--because we're appealing. In order to appeal, I had to post a $91 million bond. Normally, it would be you could do that, and then later on, if you go through an appeal process, which could take a long time-- This woman--is not a believable person. The judge knows this. But the judge is a, in my opinion, he's a highly corrupt judge. You hadda see the way he treated us in court. So I posted a 91 million dollar bond, and the woman didn't even know when it happened. And, she admitted on Anderson Cooper. ""Oh,"" she said, ""I think it was sexy. It was this."" Can you believe this? Ninety-one million. And then it additionally, before another whacked-out judge, this guy, you've been reading about it in New York, companies don't want to go to New York anymore. You watch the impact this has. Arthur Engoron. I got fined, listen to this one, $355 million for having done absolutely nothing wrong. It was, I did nothing wrong. Nothing wrong. And, it was proven. [booing] And, It was proven. He even claimed that Magnificent Mar-a-Lago--Palm Beach is at a different stratosphere from every other place in terms of houses and values. And Mar-a-Lago is the biggest, the best in the country, maybe in the world. Magnificent Mar-a-Lago is worth $18 million when he knows it's worth anywhere from 50 to 100 times that amount. But this was good for his false and fake decision. He said I was guilty before the trial started, before he knew anything about it. He says, ""He's guilty. We're only gonna have a trial on how much."" This guy, Engoron, did exactly what the fascist and racist Attorney General of New York State, Letitia James, [booing] I call her Peekaboo James, who by the way, is now being booed and heckled all over New York because they know it's a scam. [cheers and applause] But he did exactly what this racist, horrible human being told him to do. You know, she sued for 250 million, even though nobody--then she went in later on after losing every point. She said, ""We want 350."" He said, ""Oh, we'll give it to you."" This is unbelievable. Over nothing. Over nothing. The business community is up in arms. And they're gonna leave New York over it--over that and crime and everything else. They're not looking at crime. They only look at Trump. And, just as an example, I borrowed money from a bank. I paid the bank back. There was never a default, never a problem. Never a problem. I didn't even want the money. The bank wanted me to have money because that's what they do. They loan money, a small amount, much smaller than the amount you're talking about, the fine. I borrowed it. I paid it back. I paid it back early, actually, because I didn't want it. I paid it back early. I had to pay a penalty for paying it back early. How about that? I paid a penalty because I paid it back early. They didn't want the money. I said-- Anyway, the banker testified. The bankers. But the banker testified, ""No, the loan was perfect. Wha--we don't understand."" He didn't even know wha--what he was doing there. And this judge, he levels a fine for $350 million dollars--$355 million dollars on a loan that's a fraction of that size because he's a corrupt Democrat clubhouse judge. He wouldn't allow a jury. There was no jury. It was a statute that I was sued under that was never used before. It was a consumer fraud statute, never, ever used before. Did you know that? Never used it, only a first time. Where you're not allowed juries, you're not allowed anything. It was in the sole discretion of the judge. And this corrupt judge ruled that I have to pay 355 because you know what they're trying to do? They're trying to take us out, and it's not gonna work. Not gonna work. Not gonna work. [cheers and applause] It's not gonna work. But this is all crooked Joe Biden. It's, uh, directed law-fare and weaponization against his political opponents, and that includes really all of us. It's uh, what's happening is just an incredible thing. Now, take a look at your own neighborhood. You have a woman named corrupt Fani Willis. Fani. Fani. [pronounces the name ""Fawny.""] [booing] You have a woman named Fani Willis. I believe it's spelled F-A- N-I. To my way of thinking, that's Fanny. But once she became the district attorney, I think she put a little emphasis on the U. Fani. So corrupt Fani Willis hired her lover, Nathan Wade, so they could fraudulently make money together. ""Let's make money, darling. Let's see. Who can we go after? Well, if we go after somebody that nobody ever heard of, we can't make much. I got an idea. Let's do what Joe Biden and everybody else want. Let's go after Trump."" And we did nothing wrong. Perfect phone call, other than we challenged the honesty of this election. This election was rigged. Rigged. [cheers and applause] ""Lets go after, darling, I love you very much. I love you very much, darling,"" he said, even though he never did a case like this before. He got almost a million dollars. They targeted me to get the most dollars. This guy with no experience at all, think of it, he's been paid almost a million dollars. And they traveled all over the world together. Isn't that romantic? Is anybody--I mean it's sort of a beautiful love story. [murmurs something] These are beautiful people to me. To me, it's a magnificent love story, nothing--like Gone with the Winds. You know Gone with the Wind, you're not allowed to watch it anymore. You know that, right? It's politically incorrect to watch Gone with the Wind. They have a list. What were the greatest movies ever made? Well, Gone with the Wind is usually number one or two or three. And then they have another list you're not allowed to watch anymore, Gone with the Wind. You tell me, is our country screwed up? But think of it. They went on these magnificent cruises, beautiful cruise lines, beautiful, beautiful cruise lines. And they got 'em because he's paying a fortune for taking more vacations than I've ever seen anybody in history take. Has anybody ever--She may set a record for the most vacations taken in the history of a job. But with money made wrongfully prosecuting me and other innocent American patriots. We have a couple of 'em here right now, head of the Republican Party, an incredible guy. I mean they went after him. He is a very good person. Uh, we have a certain gentleman in very h","igh office who they went after, too, but he beat them because everybody should beat them. And, ah, It's too bad. A couple of people took a plea deal because they got off for nothing, but now they want to renegotiate their plea deal. They said this whole thing was a scam. But think of it. So we have Fani and her lover. But then they got caught because it's hundreds of thousands of dollars. And what did they do? They paid it back. She said, ""Oh, man, I'm screwed."" Think of this. ""Man, they got me. They got me. I got it. I paid my lover back in cash."" And now, I being a very good businessman, I said, ""Now she's really in trouble because now somebody's gonna say, 'Where did you get the cash?'"" But they don't ask those questions, do they? But I think the judge is gonna ask those questions. I think the judge is an honorable guy, and this whole thing should be dropped because many, many innocent people, their lives have been hurt. I've been—you know, I've sort of gotten used to it, [chuckling] to be honest with you. But these people, their life, they got indicted. They never--Some of them were in their 70s and 80s. They got indicted, and they're great patriots. And they were protesting a corrupt election. They were protesting a corrupt election. Or at least in their opinion, it was a corrupt election. I have no doubt about it personally. But think of that. So now they have her, because now she's taken money because she was a part of the trip, and the trips cost a lot of money, and they went on so many of them. It was so romantic, a beautiful thing to watch. Right? Nobody knew she was away for most of the time. And they went after me. But just think of it. So now she's in trouble because she's taken money that she just gave him. So she said she gave it back in cash. Okay, that's a lie. That's a total lie. And if it isn't a lie, then she's got a much bigger problem, okay? Where'd she get the cash? So this whole witch hunt should be put out of its misery and dismissed immediately. This is a horrible thing that they've done. They wanted to go after a very highly respected United States Senator, and somebody used some common sense. I think somebody probably higher up said, ""You can't do that."" A Senator that said, ""Is everything being honest in Georgia? Are they having honest elections?"" Let's indict him for asking that question. No. They tried to go after a couple of people that you wouldn't even believe if you heard their name. Their whole campaign plan is to attack me because they've done nothing else. That's all they have. This is all coming out of Washington. I don't know if you know. I call him Lover Wade. Lover Wade. Lover Wade spent days in the White House Counsel's Office. You know that, right? Do you know that, North Carolina? Spent days in the White House and days in the DOJ. This is all a Biden thing. The Fani is not a local-state story. This is done in coordination with the White House. The DA in New York is done in coordination. They took their top person in the DOJ and put him in the Manhattan district attorney's office to prosecute a gentleman named Donald Trump. Isn't that nice? They had a man, Pomerantz, who was Hillary Clinton's lawyer, represented the Democrat Party. He left the law firm, big law firm, smart law firm, very Democrat. It's okay. He left the law firm to serve free of charge in the DA's office of Manhattan to prosecute Donald Trump. He's a big-name lawyer, Pomerantz, and he left. Think of this. Think of this. He left the law firm, represented Hillary Clinton and the DNC and Democrats, and he left the law firm to go in and prosecute--""I want no salary, no salary, free of charge, Donald Trump."" And then they came in and they said, ""These charges are bullshit. You can't do that."" And he quit in a huff, and he wrote a book about it before the case was even determined. He wrote a book, a totally hon--dishonest thing. Even Alvin Bragg, the DA, said, ""this is the worst thing. This is terrible."" You gotta see the statements he made. They want to prosecute Pomerantz now. But this is all coming from the White House. Colangelo is the lawyer's name, and he comes from the White House. He was one of the top people in the White House. And they put him into the local Manhattan DA's office in order to prosecute Donald Trump. This is crooked Joe Biden. And Letitia James is totally controlled by Washington. Letitia Peekaboo James, did anybody ever hear of her? She's controlled. Peekaboo. She's controlled. Did you ever see the pictures of her campaigning? ""I will get Donald Trump."" This is before she knows anything about me. She's gon-- she's applying to—she, she is working to become the Attorney General of New York. ""I will get Donald Trump. I will get him. I will get that son of a bitch. I will get him. I'm gonna get 'im."" I think that's a fair prosecutor. New York State has gotta clean up its act, and by the way, Fulton County has to clean up its act. [cheers and applause] Pundits and inside sources say that the attacks on me will be violent. They say that it's violent, uh, the attacks a--Biden said it. He said--you know what their whole plan is? It was just released the other day. Not--it was leaked by one of the many people that probably thought it was wrong. Their whole plan is to go after Trump in every way possible, especially criminally and legally. How would you like to have my life? You like that life? ""Darling?"" I go home to our wonderful first lady. She'd never heard the word, indictment? Neither did I until--I got indicted so many times in the last few months. I got indicted more than the late great Al Capone. Did anyone ever hear of him? [laughter] Alphonse Capone. He was the meanest of 'em all. He was a gangster. If he had dinner with you and he didn't like you, you would be found dead the next morning. Your wife would not talk either because she was petrified. No, now, this was Al Capone. I got indicted more. My parents are looking down on me right now. They're saying, ""Oh, my son, he's such a good boy. He didn't do this shit! Man."" My father would say, ""He doesn't do this."" He got--think of it--I got indicted more than Alphonse Capone, the meanest. Scarface. Did anybody see the movie Scarface? He was not a nice man. Even Jim Jordan would be afraid of Scarface. Everybody was afraid of Scarface. But Scarface had a different kind of a thing. They didn't go after him like they go after me. I can tell you that. We can't let this happen. This has never happened in our country before. This happens in third world countries. This happens in banana republics. We can't let it happen here. It's gonna start with Fani, and hopefully they're gonna end the case. They're gonna end the case, not get rid of her, because this thing--this affair was going on long before the case started. So the case is totally compromised. But we don't need to get rid of her, and then put somebody else in there. It's unfair to all those people that got indicted. The list goes on and on. And, they're good people, too. They're American patriots. They were protesting a rigged election. And, it should start right here. They should throw out that fake deal from Fulton County. [cheers and applause] What they should do, they should spend their time going over the votes in Fulton County. That's what they should do. [cheers and applause] But the attacks will come through various places and through the Justice Department, FBI, even if they have no evidence whatsoever, because they don't care what happens after the election. They only care what happens before because they want to try and damage me. But here's what's happened. I'm able to explain the situation. And, if I was guilty of something, you'd know it. And the polls were all saying, ""He's not guilty. It's a witch hunt."" That it is. I've gone through this witch hunt with Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine. I've gone through this witch hunt for so long. 51 intelligence agents talking about the laptop from hell. They said it was from Russia, but they knew it wasn't from Russia. You know that. And, many other things, the Pfizer fake signatures. This is—we're dealing--we have a very corrupt country. I fired Comey. I fired a lot of bad people, but I didn't know it ran so deep. It runs deep. We're gonna get rid of the rest of them. And I know--I know who most of them are, too.[cheers and applause] They raided my house in Florida, Mar-a-Lago. They raided. With no raid--they had no reason to do so. They violated my Fourth Amendment Constitutional rights--they can't raid your house. They're not allowed to do it. They raided it. But a thing like this has never ever happened before. Joe Biden is out of control. But really, the people out of control are the people that surround him. I saw Merrick Garland. I really thought, you know, I was thinking about Merrick Garland because I came in, and I put somebody else in there instead of him. And I was thinking about him. He's liberal, but I thought he'd be a high-quality person. But the other day, he said he doesn't want to have any voter ID. He doesn't have voter ID. [booing] He said it with a straight face because he thinks voter ID is discriminatory. He said this. You need voter ID. You need identification for almost everything you do. But no. You know, in the Democrat National Convention, the last one, you had cards, identification cards that were bigger than a person's chest, a normal person, not a very big person, but a normal person like this. It had pictures from different angles. It had everything. It had everything. Probably didn't have your Social Security number, but that was about it. And, they had identification. It was voter identification. In that case, it was party identification. You had identification cards all over people. But when it comes to vote, the most important thing we do is vote. When it comes to vote, no voter ID. I--I don't think we're gonna stand for that. But Merrick Garland said that, and he said it with a straight face. ""We don't want voter ID because that's discriminatory."" No, they don't want voter ID because if you have voter ID, it's much harder to cheat. Very simple. [cheers and applause] Biden is a weak, angry, flailing president. He's flailing and failing when you think of it. He's a flailing president, and he's a failing president hoping that something sticks because they have nothing to campaign on. They have absolutely nothing. His administration has been a complete and total failure, whether it's Afghanistan where we lost 13 soldiers, 38 wounded horrifically with the arms, the legs, $85 billion worth of equipment left behind, and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of harm, and-- We still have probably could be 1,000 American hostages over there--nobody knows. But he should be attacking inflation. Or, when you think of it, inflation wouldn't have happened. The attack on Israel wouldn't have happened. The attack on U- Ukraine with Russia, Russia/Ukraine would have never happened. Everything Joe Biden touches turns to shit, everything. [prolonged cheers and applause] I tried--I tried finding a different word, but there are some words that cannot be duplicated. But it's true, everything he touches. All of this persecution is only happening because I am running for president and leading big in all of the polls, every poll. In the big new Focal poll, we're leading Biden by eight points here in Georgia, and we're leading Biden all over the country. We're leading him at numbers that the Democrats have never seen before. [cheers and applause] Nationwide, in all the swing states, we have the largest leads ever against crooked Joe Biden that we've ever had, and we're just getting started. Look, and it's only gonna get worse for him because he can't go against this radical left crazy movement. The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024. [cheers and applause] And, if we do, we're not gonna have a country left. Every time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, communists, and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor because I am being indicted for you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. [cheers and applause] Never forget our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. I won't. [cheers and applause] They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. And in the end, they are not after me--they're after you. I'm just standing in their way. I always will. [cheers and applause] We're delighted to be joined today by an outstanding American patriot who just announced that he is running for Congress in Georgia's Third Congressional District. And I have to tell you, he's worked for me since 2016. He's unbelievable. Uh, and he's always wanted to be a congressman. He wanted to grow up like some of his heroes in this room because we've got a lot of great congresspeople in this room. He's a proud Georgian, Fayette County native, and he's been a loyal friend to the Republican Party, to me, and to everybody. He's one of the most capable people you'll ever see. And I'd like to invite—where are you, Brian Jack? Where are you, Brian? Oh, there he is, Brian Jack. He's tough. He's smart. He's conservative. He's a fightah. He's a fighter, and he's a MAGA man. Say hello, Brian. Come on. BRIAN JACK: Well, thank you very--thank you very much, Mr. President. I am both humbled and honored to earn your endorsement. And, as one of your longest-serving aides, I know better than most, that these call-up speeches are best kept short and sweet. After all, we're here tonight to celebrate the now official Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump. [cheers and applause] CROWD: USA! USA! USA! JACK: So I'll keep it short. My name is Brian Jack. I'm from Fayette County, and I'm running to represent Georgia's Third Congressional District because I believe in the America First agenda that everyone in this room has propelled to enable President Trump to make our country great again. [cheers and applause] And, Mr. President, earlier today, we went through some of your record-setting accomplishments. Because the cameras are now on, I thought it best we go through them just one more time. If y'all could enlighten me, which president delivered the most secure border in American history? CROWD: Trump! JACK: Which president gave us the best economy in American history? CROWD: Trump! JACK: In 2020, which president earned the most votes in American history? CROWD: Trump! JACK: Just earlier this year, who now holds the record for the most votes in Iowa Caucus, New Hampshire primary, and Super Tuesday history?? CROWD: Trump! JACK: Ladies and gentlemen, as Georgia voters, I challenge each and every one of us. Let's get out in November, and let's set another record. Let's reelect the greatest president and political athlete of all time, Donald J. Trump. [cheers and applause] TRUMP: He's great. So, he's, he's a great gentleman. He's gonna go down as a great, great congressman and whatever he does after that. But he's wanted this for a long time, and he really sacrificed it because he wanted to stay with the campaign. He was with me right from the beginning, and he's as good as you get. So I hope you're gonna go and vote for him. He's gonna be there for a long time. He loves your state, and he loves our country. So Brian Jack, thank you very much. Appreciate it. [cheers and applause] I want to do another thing because it's a Saturday, and it's boring. There's nothing good on television. We'd rather do this anyway, wouldn't we? So— CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP: Thank you very much. So, a person who's got tremendous courage, and you know, some people go after her because they're concerned about her. She's very popular, actually. They know that, but a lot of people don't. But she's a woman that showed herself the other night when the president was so disrespectful to so many millions and millions and millions of people. She was willing to shout out. Now, sometimes you would say that's not nice, but in this case, it was very well-needed because we have to shake this country up. This country has to come back and it's never gonna come back unless we have people like Marjorie Taylor Greene. [cheers and applause] Please come up. Come. Come on up, Marjorie. Come on. [cheers and applause] CROWD: MTG! MTG! MTG! MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: Thank you, Mr. President. All right, Georgia. We know what we're gonna do in 2024. We're going to reelect our favorite president, the greatest president in United States history, Donald J. Trump. Right, Georgia? Let's get it done. Thank you. TRUMP: You're great. Keep it going. Got a lot of courage, that one. And, I spoke with Jim Jordan. I said, ""You know, Jim, I'd like to invite this gentleman up because, uh, you don't hear as much about him, but he is a hero and he's one of yours."" And, what he's doing in Congress now for exposing horrible, horrible untruths and people that were--really statements that were said about all of us. And, I just think he's doing such an incredible job. I said, ""What do you think, Jim?"" He said, ""You gotta bring him up."" Barry Loudermilk. Barry, come up. [cheers and applause] Come here, Barry. What a job he's doing. Thanks, Barry. Please. [cheers and applause] BARRY LOUDERMILK: Mr. President. I trust the American people. When Kevin McCarthy asked me to chair a special committee to investigate what really happened on January 6th, I said, ""Kevin, I'll do it under one circumstance, that I just go to the truth, whatever it is. We'll find the truth, and we'll expose it to the American people and let the American people decide what really happened."" [cheers and applause] Let me tell you, it's not easy. My dad, a World War II veteran, combat veteran and medic, told me, he said, ""You know, doing what is right isn't easy, and sometimes it's not popular. But it's always the right thing to do. People will always try to stop you from doing what's right."" I've been shot at. I've been run over. I have been called traitor to this country, and I've been lied about. But we're not gonna stop until you have the truth. God bless you, and God bless Donald Trump. [cheers and applause] TRUMP: Thank you, Barry. Great guy. Also with us are real patriots, just uh heroes. I could bring every one of them up, but they wouldn't want to do it because they want to get back to some other things. But you have great people in this state. Mike Collins, Representative, friend of ours, true patriot. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Mike. Great job. Andrew Clyde. Andrew Clyde. [cheers and applause] Where's Andrew? Great job, Andrew. He doesn't stop. A man who's, you know, people don't know he was a great wrestler, one of the best ever in the country. A lot of people don't know that. I gotta know it about, I guess, seven years ago, he's sitting in my office. I started to notice the ears, a little action going on in the ears. I said, ""Jim, did you ever wrestle?"" Then I checked his record. This guy was a champion in college for three years. He was undefeated in high school. I heard he was undefeated. Never defeated. Think of it. I know a lot about sports. To go as a freshman and to beat seniors is almost impossible. He was undefeated for four years. He was like 100 and something. Oh, then he went to a great college where he wrestled and was the NCAA champion and everything else. And, people don't know that about him, but they have to know that about Jim Jordan. He's incredible. And his sons are here, and they're also champions. So please stand up, the Jordan family. [cheers and applause] Great. And in Congress, he's just like he was in wrestling. There's a lot of similarities. I'll tell you. You have a great father, fellas, and you guys are doing a great job. Also, champion top, champion wrestlers, I don't know, there are a hell of a lot bigger than you too, Jim. Huh? I don't know. But I asked your boy. I said, ""So he's an All-American."" I said, ""Are you as good as your father?"" He said, ""Nope, not as good as my father."" That's pretty good. You're an All-American, and you say the father--see, I wouldn't have said that. I would say I was better, then I'd have a problem with—[laughter] But it's a great family. And to Polly and everybody, thank you very much. Great job, what you've done. Benjamin and Isaac, Benjamin and Isaac, thank you for being here, fellas. [cheers and applause] A friend of mine, somebody who's really going places he already has, but he's really gone, his father was a fantastic man, so respected. And he's right now the lieutenant governor of your state, and he is with us all the way, Bert Jones. Bert, thank you. [cheers and applause] And his great father. Will you please stand up. I love his father. This is a tough cookie. That's a great family. Thank you. What a great family. You didn't see crowds like this with all the years. This is incredible. Isn't that right? Never happened before. You know, they don't want to talk about it [gestures toward cameras] the fake news. There's never been a movement like this ever, where you come down— Look, Biden's here today. He probably has 100 people. Legit people, I'd say 30. But they work hard and they probably have--that's where he made the statement about apologizing for using the word illegal--but he had a very small crowd. But every, every place we go, we never have empty seats. We have lots of people standing outside, sometimes in the rain and the cold, but there's never been anything like it. And this is about making America great again, so it's very important. [cheers and applause] A friend of mine and somebody that should have been senator, and he was a really great senator, but he should have been senator, bad things happened, David Purdue. David, thank you. Good man. Another friend of mine. He headed up the hearings in Congress when he was going after Mueller. Remember that? You hear his voice. ""Is it true that you this or that you that?"" He's like central casting, a friend—uh, just a great guy. What he did at Congress was amazing. Jim and everybody else will testify to that. And uh, he's loved by the people in Georgia, and I assume he's gonna be doing something because he's still a young man, Doug Collins. Thank you, Doug. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Doug. Great job. You gotta watch those hearings. You gotta watch the way he grilled Mueller. You remember that? ""Is it true that you did this? Is it true that you got that?"" And the guy just said, ""I don't know. Please, let me away, let me go home."" Remember that, Doug? You'll never forget that. I have that on the highlight reels, by the way. Georgia Agricultural Commissioner, the Agriculture Commissioner, Tyler, Tyler Harper. Good job you're doing, Tyler. [cheers and applause] Labor Commissioner, Bruce Thompson. Bruce, thank you. Good job. An incredible Senator. I have to tell you from day one, he was on the front lines, and he is a popular guy. People love him because he fights for justice. He got what was happening to the state very early on, and Bert can say it--very early on. Brandon Beach, what a great job you've done, Brandon. What a job. Thank you.[cheers and applause] And so many other politicians and representatives and people that love Georgia, so many that if I ever announced them, would never get off, but I just want to thank you all for being here. We have some great, great people, great great people here, all of the great representatives that have worked so hard. From the very first day that we take back the White House from crooked Joe Biden, I believe we're going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country. I believe that. Every problem Joe Biden has created can be fixed. Every problem can be solved, and every injustice can be set right. We will bring this country back together through success. The word is success. They said it's revenge. They said, ""I'm out for revenge. I'm not out for revenge. My revenge will be success."" [cheers and applause] Before I even arrive at the Oval Office shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled, and we will restore peace through strength.[cheers and applause] I will pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. Now, what that means is very simple. We get all these bad deals, we changed a lot of 'em, most of 'em, but still plenty of them out there, a lot of unfair deals. If China or any other country makes us pay a tariff or tax, let's say 100 to 200%, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff of 100 to 200% right back. [cheers and applause] It's called you screw us and we screw you, and everybody's happy. [cheers and applause] And as tariffs on foreign countries go up, taxes on American workers and families will come down. You know, we gave you the largest tax reduction in the history of our country and we're going still further, and yet we took in more revenue than ever before. And as I said, for many years, I will always protect Medicare and Social Security, which others are not able to do, like Joe Biden. You're not gonna have it. It's gonna be gone. It's Joe Biden who's destroying them, and he is doing it with a migrant invasion. This migrant invasion is much more dangerous than you think in so many other ways. It's gonna have huge impact on rights that you're entitled to, and that includes Social Security and Medicare. We will restore law and order to our country. I am going to indemnify all police officers and law enforcement officials throughout the United States to protect them from being destroyed by the radical left for taking strong actions on crime. They can solve the problem. We are going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety, and beauty better than they have ever been before. We will take over the horribly-run capital of the United States of America, Washington, D.C. Clean it up, renovate it, rebuild our capital city so that it is no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world. People from Georgia go down to Washington now and they get shot. Horrible things are happening. You see graffiti all over the place. Beautiful columns built 200 years ago and 100 years ago, gorgeous columns. You say, how did they ever build 'em? How did they move 'em? They didn't have the equipment to move 'em. They moved 'em through force of will. They got them there through force of will. You look at these massive structures and you say, how did they ever do that? They didn't have caterpillar tractors. They didn't have anything. They had their hands and their muscle, and they got it done. And now I see graffiti on it. It's not gonna happen. We're gonna take care of our capital. We're gonna take care of our capital. [cheers and applause] On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school, any school, at all pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the lives of our children. [cheers and applause] And I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate. [cheers and applause] And I will keep men out of women's sports. [cheers and applause] And I will fully protect and uphold our great and very important under siege Second Amendment. We will protect. [cheers and applause] We will protect innocent life, and we will restore free speech, and I will secure our elections. We will secure our elections. If we don't, we are a country in trouble. Our goal will be one day voting with paper ballots and voter ID. Very simple. But until then, Republicans must go out and we have to swamp 'em. We have to go out and we have to get so many votes. We want this to be landslide. That way, it's too big to rig. We want to make it too big to rig. [cheers and applause] If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States and added them up, they would not have done near the destruction to our country as Joe Biden and the Biden administration have done. So if you want to save America, then go vote. The Georgia primary is this Tuesday, March 12th and Georgia could be the state that puts us--look, if we win Georgia, we're gonna win the election. Let me put it that way. Okay? [cheers and applause] We have to win Georgia. [cheers and applause] So get everyone you know, and let's send crooked Joe Biden packing. Let's send 'im out. So in conclusion, together, we are taking on some of the most menacing forces and vicious opponents our people have ever seen. We've never seen anything like it before. But no matter how hateful and corrupt the communists and criminals that we're fighting against are, you must never forget this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you. This is your home. This is your heritage. And our American liberty is your God-given right. From Atlanta to Augusta, from Savannah to Columbus, beautiful Columbus, we just left Columbus and it's quite a place, and from Athens to right here in Rome, [cheers and applause] we inherit the legacy of red blooded American patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. [Music playing.] But now, we are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that is the highest inflation in 50 years, where banks are collapsing and interest rates are skyrocketing. Likewise, we are a nation where energy costs have reached the highest levels in our history. We are no longer energy-independent or energy-dominant as we were j","ust a few short years ago. We are a nation that is begging Venezuela and others for oil. ""Please, please, please help us,"" Joe Biden says. Yet we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation anywhere in the world. We are a nation that just recently heard that Saudi Arabia and Russia will be reducing their oil production, while at the same time substantially increasing the price. And we met that threat by announcing that we will no longer be drilling for oil in large areas of Alaska and elsewhere on our precious land. We are a nation that is consumed by the radical left's Green New Deal. Yet everyone knows that the Green New Scam is fake and will lead to our destruction. We are a nation whose leaders are demanding all-electric cars, despite the fact that they don't go far, cost too much, and whose batteries are produced in China, where materials are only available in China, when an unlimited amount of gasoline is available inexpensively in the United States but is not available in China. And now, we are a nation that wants to make our revered and very powerful army tanks the best anywhere in the world, all electric, so that despite the fact that they also are not able to go far, fewer pollutants will be released into the air as we blast our way through enemy territory in an environmentally friendly way. [laughter] And they also want to make our fighter jets with a green stamp of energy savings, the losing 15% efficiency, but allowing us to keep our enemies atmosphere clean of emissions as we viciously and unceremoniously attack them at levels that they have never seen before. Who are these people that would do this to us? Who are these people who would destroy our country? Who are these people who want our country to be destroyed? We are a nation that ended oil exploration and production in the US just as the price of oil reached an all time high. What other country would do such a foolish thing? What other country would be so self-destructive? Can we be energy independent, even dominant again? Yes, oh yes, and quickly, says President Trump. Yes, oh yes, we can. We are a nation that surrendered in Afghanistan leaving dead soldiers, American citizens, and $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment in the world behind, and also abandoning Bagram, one of the biggest military bases anywhere in the world and only one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. And we are a nation that allowed Russia and Ukraine to fight killing hundreds of thousands of people and it will only get worse. It would never have happened with me as your president. And for four straight years, it didn't happen. Likewise, the horrifying attack on Israel would never have happened. They wouldn't even have thought of doing such a thing if President Trump was in the Oval Office. Iran was broke under the Trump administration. They didn't have the money to fund Hamas, Hezbollah, and all of the other instruments of terror that they funded previously. But those sanctions were lifted by a corrupt Biden administration. And now, Iran is a rich country again with $221 billion and another $6 billion that they got for hostages from us, and 10 billion dollars for electricity to Iraq, all compliments of an incompetent Biden administration. They gave them so many compliments and they gave them so much money. And China with Taiwan is next. We are a nation that allows radical left terrorists to violently attack our cities, leaving behind massive destruction and death. And nothing happens to the criminals that do these terrible things. There is no punishment. But when people who love our country protest on January 6th in Washington, they become hostages, unfairly imprisoned for long periods of time. We are a third world nation that has weaponized its law enforcement against opposing political party like never ever before has happened in our country. We've got a Federal Bureau of Investigation that won't allow bad election-changing facts to be presented to the public and which offers $1 million to a writer of fiction about Donald Trump to lie and say it was fact, where Hunter Biden's laptop from hell was Russian disinformation. And the FBI knew it wasn't, but 51 intelligence agents said it was. And a Department of Justice that refuses to investigate egregious acts of voting irregularities and fraud. And we have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst president in the history of our country who is cognitively impaired and in no condition to lead, and is now in charge of dealing with Russia and possible nuclear war, which would be World War III and far more devastating than any of the previous world wars because of the weaponry that no one even wants to think about. We are a nation that no longer has a free and fair press. Fake news is all you get. And they indeed, oh yes, they are indeed the enemy of the people. They refuse to discuss the Biden crime family, but enjoy covering the false indictments of Donald J. Trump who has done nothing wrong except win an election that was not supposed to be able to be won. We are a nation where free speech is no longer allowed and where crime is rampant and out of control like never ever before. We are a nation that is allowing Iran to build a massive nuclear weapon and China to use the trillions and trillions of dollars it has taken from us to build a military to rival our own. And less than three years ago, we had Iran, China, Russia, and North Korea in check. They respected us. They were afraid of us. They weren't going to do a thing against us, and everyone knows it. And now Russia and China are holding summits to carve up the world. And perhaps most importantly, we are a nation that is no longer admired, respected, or listened to on the world stage. We are a nation that is in many ways become a joke. And we are a nation that is hostile to liberty, freedom, faith, and even hostile to God. We are a nation whose economy is collapsing into a cesspool of ruin, whose supply chain is broken, whose stores are not stocked, whose deliveries are not coming, and whose educational system is ranked at the bottom of every single list. We are a nation that just sold a once great company, United States Steel, to Japan. We are a nation whose stock market's continued success is totally contingent on MAGA winning the next election. That's why it's going up. We are a nation where large packs of sadistic criminals and thieves are allowed to go into stores and openly rob them, beat up and kill their workers and customers and leave with armloads of goods but with no retribution; where the authority of our great police has been taken; where their families and pensions have been threatened, and their lives would be destroyed for the mere mention of the words ""law enforcement."" We are a nation where fentanyl and other forms of illegal drugs are easier to get than groceries to feed our beautiful families. We have become a drug-infested nation, crime-ridden nation. We have become a nation like nobody thought possible In many cases. We have become, quite honestly, a horrible and unfair nation. We will institute the powerful death penalty for drug dealers where each dealer is responsible for the death during their lives of 500 people or more. Mothers will never again be forced to watch their children overdosing and hopelessly dying in their arms, screaming, ""What can I do? What can I do? What can I do?"" We are a nation who's once revered, airports are a dirty, crowded mess. You sit and wait for hours and then are notified that the plane won't leave and they have no idea when they will, where ticket prices have tripled. They don't have the pilots to fly the planes, they don't have qualified air traffic controllers, and they just don't know what the hell they're doing. We are a nation that screens its citizens viciously at the ports, every single port. But if you are an illegal alien, you are allowed to flow through our southern border by the millions. So sad. And look what has just happened to one particular great, great family with a magnificent daughter who is no longer with us. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, its willpower, and its strength. We are a nation that has lost its way, but we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Three years ago, we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again. [cheers and applause] It was hardworking patriots like you who built this country, and it is hardworking patriots like you who are going to save our country. We will fight for America like no one has ever fought before. 2024 is our final battle. With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state. We will expel the war mongers from our government. We will drive out the globalists, we will cast out the communists, Marxists and fascists, and we will throw off the sick political class. That's what they are. They hate our country. We will rout the fake news media, we'll drain the swamp, and we will liberate our country from these tyrants and villains once and for all. [cheers and applause] Like those patriots before us. We will not bend, we will not break, we will not yield. We will never give in, we will never give up, and we will never, ever back down. [cheers and applause] With your support, we will go on to victory, the likes of which no one has ever seen before. We will evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House, and we will take back our country on November 5th, 2024. It will go down as the most important date in the history of our country. [cheers and applause] The great silent majority is rising like never before. And under our leadership, the forgotten man and woman will be forgotten no longer. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America powerful again, [cheers and applause] We will make America wealthy again. [cheers and applause] We will make America strong again, we will make America proud again [cheers and applause] we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much. Thank you Georgia. God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you."

Biden, Jr.","March 09, 2024","Remarks at a Campaign Event in Atlanta, Georgia","Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Remarks at a Campaign Event in Atlanta, Georgia Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370756",17641,"The President. Hello, Atlanta! I'm Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter] And, Desera, thank you for your introduction. And when you're President and I say—they say, ""Joe Biden is out in the waiting room,"" don't say ""Joe who?"" Okay? [Laughter] Mayor Andre Dickenson—Dickens—I just add another syllable to your name. [Laughter] Thank you for the passport into the city, Mr. Mayor. And Reverend Senator Warnock, thank you for your leadership. And thank you for the honor—giving me the honor to speak at your congregation at Ebenezer Baptist Church. Look, Senator Ossoff—you're the best, Jon. You're doing a hell of a job. And he's always, always there, and he votes his conscience, and he's not afraid to stand up for what he believes. To the many Members of the House of Representatives here and all other elected officials, thank you for your service. And to former Atlanta mayor and former member of my team in the White House, Keisha Lance Bottoms, thank you. Keisha—I said to her a moment ago—I said, ""We miss you."" And her husband said: ""So did I. I got her."" [Laughter] And, Governor Wes Moore, thank you for coming down from Maryland, man. He's the best, man. He can play. [Laughter] And all of you here today, you know, you're the reason why we're going to win. By the way, that's not hyperbole. You're the reason we're going to win. Donald Trump has a different constituency. Here's a guy who's kicking off his general election campaign on the road up with Marjorie Taylor Greene. Audience members. Boo! The President. It can tell you a lot about a person who he keeps company with. [Laughter] And yesterday he was hosting at his club Viktor Orban—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——who says he doesn't think democracy works. Called him a ""fantastic leader."" Seriously. [Laughter] He's been sucking up to win him—[laughter]—anyway—[inaudible]—dictators and authoritarian thugs all around the world. He said the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un wrote him a—quote, ""wrote him a beautiful letter."" [Laughter] He bragged about calling Xi Jinping a ""king."" He called Putin, and he said, ""Do whatever the hell you want to our allies."" Audience members. Boo! The President. I'm not making these—I'm not making these quotes up. When he says he wants to be a dictator, I believe him. But I don't want to get carried away here. [Laughter] Before I begin, I want to say thank you—— Audience member. What are you going to do, Genocide Joe? Tens of thousands of Palestinians—[inaudible]. The President. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Wait, wait, wait. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Look, thank you. Look, I don't resent—I don't resent—I don't resent his passion. There's a lot of Palestinians who are being unfairly victimized. But, folks, look—— Audience member. Free, free Palestine! Free, free Palestine! The President. ——before I begin, I want to say thank you to all those outstanding Black, Latinos, AAPI organizations supporting Kamala and me. In 2020 and 2022, especially here in Georgia, but all across the country, you called your neighbors, you texted your friends, you knocked on doors, and you never stop. And you're with us all the way. And we're here to say a simple thank you, thank you, thank you. And you're here tonight because you really want to do it again, because you are going to win this primary for us on Tuesday. And because we're going to win in November. So I mean this: Thank you, thank you, thank you. I really mean it. Three years ago, you helped the Democratic ticket and won Georgia a Presidential election for the first time in 30 years. On Thursday, when I gave my State of the Union Address, I talked about how far we've come since the 2020 election. I also talked about how much is at stake. Folks, it's not hyperbole to suggest our freedoms are literally on the ballot this November. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are trying to take our freedoms away. And by the way, not all Republicans. This ain't your father's Republican Party. These guys are different. But guess what? We're not going to let them take them away. Thursday night marked 59 years since hundreds of foot soldiers for justice in Selma, Alabama, marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge named after the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan to claim their fundamental right to vote. They were beaten, they are bloodied, they were left for dead, but they were unbowed. Our late friend, son of Georgia, John Lewis, was there. And what happened? Five months later, we passed—the Voting Rights Act was signed into law. But nearly six decades after that, the same forces are back—led by Donald Trump—taking us back in time, suppressing the vote, subverting elections. That's why we have to stand up again. We know what to do. And my message to Georgia voters and to voters all across this country is: Send me a Congress that will pass the Freedom To Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The same forces that want to deny the right to vote try to deny other core values of American diversity as well: banning books, erasing history. Instead of celebrating the contribution of immigrants to our country, to our economy, and our communities, Donald Trump calls them ""vermin,"" ""poison"" in the blooding of—poisoning the blood of America. No one should ever doubt where my heart is. Unlike Donald Trump, on my first day in office as President, I introduced a comprehensive plan to fix our immigration system, secure our border, provide a pathway for citizenship for ""Dreamers"" and their families, farmworkers, essential workers who helped us through the pandemic and are part of the fabric of our community. Because unlike Donald Trump, I know who we are as Americans. It's why I promised to have an administration that looks like America. The most diverse Cabinet and administration in American history led by a [historic; White House correction] Vice President. A court that represents all the people. Sixty-five percent of the judges I've appointed are women. Sixty-five percent are people of color. I've appointed more Black women to the circuit courts than every other President in American history combined and the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. Look, in my State of the Union Address, I talked about the social worker in Alabama. She scheduled an IVF treatment for a second child. But the Supreme Court of Alabama shut down IVF treatments across the State, unleashed by the U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Audience members. Boo! The President. What her family has gone through should never have happened. And, folks—folks, you know why this happened. Well, I tell you why: Donald Trump. He came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. In fact, he brags about it. Well, he got his wish. And States are passing bans that criminalize doctors, forcing rape and incest victims to leave their States to get help. And now MAGA Republicans and Donald Trump want to pass a national ban on the right to choose. Well, hear me loud and clear: not on my watch. In its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote, and I quote, ""Women are not without electoral or political power."" As I said in the State of the Union, ""They ain't seen nothing yet."" But they're about to see—they're about to see it, just like we saw it on the ballot in 2022 and 2023. And they'll find out again in 2024. I'm deadly earnest about this. Look, I want to thank Vice President Harris for leading the way on this issue and so many others. And, Georgia, I have a message for you: Send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, and I promise you I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again. Folks, I inherited an economy that was on the brink. But since I took office, we've created 15 million new jobs in just 3 years. That's a record in American history. Eight hundred new manufacturing jobs. I said, ""Where's it written that we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world?"" Unemployment hit a 50-year low—so far. And under Donald Trump, Black and Latino unemployment skyrocketed. Under my administration, we have record low Black and Latino unemployment. Donald Trump, Asian American unemployment nearly doubled. Now—now—the employment rate of Asian Americans is the highest it's been since 2008. Look, we've cut Black child poverty in half, cut Latino poverty by a record as well. We're seeing the fastest rate of new Latino businesses all over this decade. And the next 30 years, it's going to even be bigger. Look, folks, more people have health insurance than ever before. The racial wealth gap is a smallest it's been in 20 years. Wages are back up; inflation is coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9 to 3 percent. And we've already accomplished a lot. So now let's talk about the future we can build together. It's about the future. For example, Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere else in the world. It's wrong. But I'm ending it. With the law I proposed that we signed, no—not one Republican voted for it, I might add—we finally beat Big Pharma. For example, instead of paying $400 a month for insulin that saves seniors lives, they now only pay $35. Do you know how much it costs to make it? It costs $10. It costs $10 to make it. But I didn't stop there. We capped insulin at 35 bucks a month, and I want to do it for every single American. I finally beat Big Pharma and gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for all prescription drugs and—like the VA does. But guess what? It just doesn't save seniors money, it's saving the taxpayers $160 billion, that one thing. Seriously. Cutting the Federal deficit—these guys talk about the debt—I don't want to get into that. I'll get carried—[laughter]. Now it's time to go further and negotiate lower drug prices for every drug. Look, that will save taxpayers, if we do that, another $200 billion because Medicare doesn't have to pay the bill. Beginning in January of next year, it's already the law we passed. We capped prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at total $2,000 a year, no matter how much they cost. Because you—as some of you know, unfortunately, you've experienced it. These cancer drugs can cost $10-, $12-, $15,000 a year. Now let's cap prescription drug costs to $2,000 a year for every American—all Americans. And, folks, the Affordable Care Act is still a very big deal. It used to be called ""Obamacare."" Over 100 Americans—100 million Americans can no longer be denied health insurance because of a preexisting condition because of that law. And not only that, we've lowered the cost of insurance by $800 a year for so many families—and on top of it. Donald Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Audience members. Boo! The President. That would mean ripping health insurance away from 3 million Black Americans, 4 million Latinos, and a million Asian Americans. I've got news for Donald Trump: not on my watch. [Laughter] And if Trump and the Republicans try to cut Social Security again, I will stop them. Look, I'm also working to bring down the cost of housing. That's why I want to provide—I want to provide an annual tax credit for the next 2 years of $400 a month, over the next 2 years, as rates come down, to put toward mortgages. If they're—buying your first home or you need to trade up a little for more space. That's what's going to happen. And the interest rates will be down. We're cracking down on big landlords who break antitrust laws by price fixing and driving up rents. Now Congress needs to pass my plan to build and renovate 2 million affordable houses and apartments and bring those rents down. Look, we're also removing all poisonous lead pipes in the—millions of them in America so every child can turn on a water fountain at school or at home without risking getting brain damage, because that's what's happening. Look, and I'm making college more affordable. It was hard for me and my brothers and sisters to get through college because it was tough. And the tuitions weren't even anywhere near what they are today. By fixing the student loan program, like the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, I've reduced the burden of student debt for nearly 4 million Americans, including teachers, nurses, firefighters, and other public servants. Donald Trump swears that if he gets elected, he's going to stop it. Well, let me tell you something: He won't stop me. So let's continue to increase Pell grants for working class and middle class families, increase our record investment in HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions. We already contributed over $7 billion to HBCUs. And you know why? Because they're just as bright, just as capable as—though they don't have the endowments. And so they can't—they can't—they don't have the laboratories to train for the new high-tech jobs. But now they will. And now they do. Look, we're building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. Donald Trump did just the opposite. He enacted a $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the top one-half of 1 percent and the biggest corporations and exploded the Federal deficit. He added more to the national debt in the 4 years he was there than any Presidential term in history—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——so—by the way. Give me a break about reducing the debt. Come on. Folks, how many of you think the Tax Code is fair? Raise your hand. Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, I sure don't. And I'm going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair. Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in Federal tax. Nobody. Not one penny. But big corporations and the very wealthy will finally begin to pay their fair share. In 2020, the 55 largest corporation—of the five—Fortune 500, 55 of those companies made $40 billion in profits, and they didn't pay a single penny in tax. Zero. Audience members. Boo! The President. Not anymore. Thanks to the law I wrote and signed, big companies have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. But 15 percent is still less than working people pay in Federal taxes. It's time to raise the corporate minimum tax to at least 21 percent so every billion-dollar corporation begins to finally begin to pay their fair share. Look, folks, there are 1,000 billionaires in America—1,000. Look, I'm a—I'm a capitalist. If you make a billion dollars, fine, if you do it fairly. But guess what? Pay your fair share of Federal taxes. Do you know how much they pay? You know what the rate is they pay in Federal taxes? Eight-point-two percent. Raise your hand if you'd trade for that? You'd all take 8.2 percent, wouldn't you? It's far less than the vast majority of Americans pay. No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, a nurse. That's why I proposed a minimum tax of 25 percent for billionaires—25—just 25 percent. You know how much money that would raise? Five hundred billion dollars over the next 10 years. Imagine what that could do for America and our—for our future—from lowering the deficit to childcare, home care, paid leave so many other countries have—and still lower the deficit. Look, folks, let me close with this. You're all standing. I'm keeping you too long. I know—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. I know the American story. It's a—thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. Folks, look, I know the American story. It's a contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of this Nation, between those who want to pull America backwards and those who want to move America into the future. My lifetime has taught me to embrace the future of freedom and democracy. And Trump and I have a very different value set, if it isn't obvious already. Mine is based on core values that have defined America. And the rest of the world looks at us that way: decency, honesty, fairness, equality. But we all know Donald Trump sees a different America, an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution. That's not me. That's not you. We see a future where we define democracy and defend it, not diminish it. We see a future where we defend the basic freedoms, not take them away. We see a future—we see a future where we reward work, not just wealth, where the wealthy pay their fair share. And we see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence. And, folks, I mean this. As I've traveled the world—I've been in most countries around the world. I know the vast majority of the world leaders because I've been around a day or two. [Laughter] I know I don't look it. [Laughter] But we see a future—I see a future—that must remain the beacon of the world. Above all, we see a country for all Americans, a future for all Americans, a Presidency for all Americans. So join me. Get out the vote. Vote! Vote! Vote! Audience members. Vote! Vote! Vote! The President. Vote! Folks, from the bottom of my heart, I believe in America. I believe in you, the American people. We just have to remember who we are, for God's sake. We are the United States of America. There is simply nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together. So let's do that. Get out to vote. And God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. [At this point, the President picked up a pin thrown onto the stage.] ""Regulate guns, not women.""","","",""

Biden, Jr., Remarks at a Campaign Event in Wallingford, Pennsylvania Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370760",19698,"The President. I think I should go home now. [Laughter] Hello, Delco! I'm Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter] And thanks to the elected officials here today, including someone—I keep telling her I think we're related. We come from the same—our families come from the same county in Ireland. Representative Scanlon, where is she? [Laughter] There you are. You're doing a hell of a job representing this district. If you're tired, you probably watched my address last night. [Laughter] I got my usual warm reception from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. [Laughter] In my address, I spoke about how far we've come since we took office. And I talked about how much is at stake. Folks, our freedoms really are on the ballot this November. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are trying to take away our freedoms. That's not an exaggeration. Well, guess what? We will not let him. We will not let him. Last night, at the U.S. Capitol, the same building where our freedoms came under assault on July the 6th—excuse me, January the 6th, we talked about another [a mother in; White House correction] Alabama. Fourteen months ago, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to another Alabaman—thanks to the miracle of IVF. She scheduled treatments to have a second child. But the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the State, unleashed by the U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. She was told her dream would have to wait. What her family has gone through should never have happened. And, folks, do you know why it happened? I'll tell you why. One reason: Donald Trump. He came to office determined to overturn Roe v. Wade. In fact, he's bragged about it repeatedly that he's the reason it got overturned. He got his wish. And States are passing bans, criminalizing doctors, forcing rape and incest victims to leave their State to get care. And now, MAGA Republicans and Donald Trump want to pass a national ban on the right to choose, period. Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, take it seriously, folks. Because it's—that's what they're doing—heading for. Hear me loud and clear: This will not happen on my watch. The decision—the decision to over—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. The decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote, ""Women are not without electoral power or political power."" Clearly, these bragging—[laughter]—anyway. [Laughter] Those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. No clue. They found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot in 2022 and 2023, and they'll find out again in 2024. I mean this from the bottom my heart when I say I thank Vice President Harris for leading on this issue and so many others. You know—and, Pennsylvania, I have a message for you: Send me the Congress that I—can support this right, and I promise you, if we take back Congress, we will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. Look, I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in our Nation's history. And we have. I inherited an economy that was—was on the brink. Excuse me. Now our economy is the envy of the world. Fifteen million new jobs in just 3 years—that's a record in American history. Unemployment hit a 50-year low. Eight hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs and counting. As I said when I started, where is it written that we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world again? Wages are up, and inflation is coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3 percent. We made so much progress. So now let's talk about the future we can build, because we have more to do. Look, the future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share, God love them. For example, Americans pay more—as the pharmacist can tell us, the doc can tell us—for prescription drugs than anywhere else in the world. It's wrong. And I've been fighting the pharmaceutical industry since I was in the Senate for over 30 years. But guess what? We're ending it. And the law I proposed and signed, no one—not one Republican voted for it, but we finally beat Big Pharma. Instead of paying $400 a month, for example, on insulin for seniors, they only have to pay 35 bucks. And by the way, it only costs $10 to make. They're still paying thirty—they're still getting a big profit. But look, I'm not stopping there. Let's cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it, not just seniors. I finally beat Big Pharma. And now we're giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, just like the VA does for our military. This doesn't just save seniors money; it's saving taxpayers billions of dollars, cutting the deficit. Now it's time to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for even more drugs. You know, it's going to save the taxpayers another $200 billion. It already saved $160 billion off your taxes because the Medicare doesn't have to pay that bill. Folks, starting next year—the bill I got passed, we're capping the total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $14-, $15,000 a year. And my goal next year: Let's do that for all of America—all of America. Let's cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for everyone. And, folks, the Affordable Care Act is still a very big deal. Over 100 million Americans can no longer be denied health insurance because of preexisting conditions. But Donald Trump has announced he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and his Republican colleagues tried 49 other times in the last—since Obamacare was passed. But it's not going to happen on my watch. Look, I'm also working to bring down the cost of housing. I'm proposing an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month over the next 2 years to put toward their mortgage if they are buying for the first home or if in fact they're moving into a larger place because they're afraid they're going to lose the mortgage rate they have. But guess what? I can't guarantee it, but I'll bet you—I'll bet you—those rates come down more because I bet you that that little outfit that sets interest rates is going to come down. [Laughter] It's going to come down. And, folks, we're cracking down on big landlords who break antitrust laws by price-fixing and driving up rents. Now Congress needs to pass my plan to build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and apartments and bring those rents down. And by the way, a lot of my Republican friends that's costing a lot of money and raising the deficit. Guess what? We cut the deficit. It cut the deficit $1 trillion. The last guy ballooned the deficit. We passed a budget deal that will cut another trillion dollars over the next decade. They kept trying to get out of it, but they finally agreed. And now it's my goal to cut the Federal deficit by $3 billion more—$3 trillion more by making big corporations and the very wealthy—and I'm a capitalist, by the way. You can go make a million bucks; you make a billion, good for you. But pay your taxes. We have a thousand billionaires in America—a thousand. And guess how much they're—what their tax rate is? Eight-point-three percent. Anybody want to trade your tax rate with them? I'm—think about that. Eight-point-three percent—a billionaire. Audience member. I pay more than that. The President. Donald Trump—you sure in hell do. [Laughter] Look, Donald Trump enacted a $2 trillion tax cut when he was President, overwhelmingly benefiting the very wealthy, and exploded the Federal deficit—exploded it. We cut the deficit. And we [he; White House correction] added more to the national debt than any President in his term in all of history—and under Donald Trump. These guys talk about—oh. [Laughter] Too many corporations raise their prices and pad their profits, charging you more and more for less and less. That's why we're cracking down on corporations engaged in price gouging and deceptive pricing. Looks like companies that—that you wouldn't notice—they thought you wouldn't notice. But you know, if you're—they give you the same sized bag of potato chips with about 20-percent fewer potato chips in it. [Laughter] No, by the way, that's not a joke. Some of you may have seen, there was a TV thing on how Snickers bars—same exact price with a—don't hold me to the exact number—but, like, 20-percent less bar. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Congress needs to sign Bobby Casey's bill to stop shrinkflation—stop it. These are—in the family I grew up in, these are kitchen table issues. I'm also getting junk fees for those hidden fees added to the end of your bills without your knowledge. My administration just announced we're cutting credit card late fees from $32 to $8. And by the way, I'm not being arbitrary. The law says they can charge for a late fee what it costs them to collect it. It does not cost anywhere near $32, but they make, over time—over that period, billions of dollars. Literally, it stunned me. You've got 450,000 people paying those late fees. And they charge—that's what we're—they end up paying over $2 billion. The banks and credit card companies don't like it. Why? I'm saving American families $20 billion a year with those junk fees by eliminating them—$20 billion. And by the way, I grew up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware. Those are the two places I grew up. And you know what? That made a difference in my household, if you had to pay an extra 50 bucks a month, 100 bucks a month, for things. That wasn't fair. It matters, and so does this. Folks, does anybody think the Tax Code is fair? Audience members. No! The President. No, I mean it. I'm serious. I don't. And I'm going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair. Under my plan, nobody making less than $400,000 a year, which I had never made—[laughter]—until I became President—[laughter]—will pay one penny in additional tax—nobody—not one penny. But big corporations—[applause]. Big corporations will finally have to begin to pay their fair share. No, really, this is just fairness. It's about fairness and decency. This is not a—we're not making this stuff up. In 2020, 50—you may remember, this was a big fight I had with the Republicans. In 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America made $40 billion in profit and paid zero in Federal taxes. Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, I was determined to change that. And guess what? Not anymore. Thanks to the law I wrote and signed, big companies now have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. It's only 15 percent. It's still less than working people pay in Federal taxes. This time, we're going to raise the minimum tax to corporations to at least 21 percent. And so every billion-dollar corporation finally begins to pay their fair share. Look, I want to end tax breaks for Big Pharma, Big Oil, corporate jets, massive executive pay that gets deducted. Look, as I said, there are a thousand billionaires in America, and their Federal tax rate is 8.2 percent. I said 3 before. That's far less than the vast majority of you pay. No billionaire should pay a lower tax than a teacher or a sanitation worker or a nurse. No, I mean—[applause]. That's why I proposed not the highest tax, the minimum tax of 25 percent for billionaires—just 25. And guess what? Do you know how much money that would raise over the next 10 years? Five hundred billion dollars. And imagine what that could do for America and for our future. It could cut the deficit, it could provide for childcare, it could provide—I mean, there's so much that we need to do—and not raise the deficit. Well, let's invest in—and let's continue to invest in the future by confronting the climate crisis, not denying it. I don't know—even—since I've been President, I've gone with the—with all the folks from my administration. I have flown over those wildfires out West and in the Northwest, in the Southwest. I've—literally in a helicopter, all of them. And guess what? It's burned down more timber and more housing than comprises the entire State of Maryland. We're taking the most significant action on climate ever in the history of the world. They said I couldn't get it passed. We got $369 billion passed for climate change and still cut the deficit. And America is safe—America is safer today than when I took office. The year before I took office, murder rates went up to 30 percent nationwide, the biggest increase in American history under the last guy. And now, through the American Rescue Plan—which every Republican voted against, I might add—I made the largest investment in public safety ever. Last year, murder rates saw the sharpest decrease in history. Violent crime led—fell to one of the lowest levels more than—in more than 50 years. I'm ramping up Federal enforcement to violence—for the Violence Against Women Act, which I proudly wrote, so we can finally end the scourge of violence against women. These guys fought taking away guns from domestic abusers. I mean, I don't know where they're—we beat the NRA when I proposed and signed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years. Now we have to beat NRA again. I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. I did it once. And pass universal background checks. Repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers. Look, imagine if tobacco had the same limitations—companies—that gun manufacturers. The only major corporation in America—industry in America that you cannot sue is gun manufacturers. Think about that. Imagine if that had been the case with tobacco, how many more people would be dying of cancer. Look, there's a lot more to say. But I'm keeping you standing too long. I know—[laughter]—I know—I know—[applause]. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Look, I was watching on television last night about 2 in the morning, after we got back to the house—[laughter]—the house—the White House. [Laughter] Still think of—hard to think of it as home. [Laughter] I had the TV on. And there was a Fox News commentator saying: ""You know, Biden is changing from trickle-down economics to build from the middle out and the bottom up. It's going to ruin America."" Ruin America? We have the strongest economy in the world right now. And like I said—well, like I said—and I mean this sincerely, and I've believed it my whole career and finally got it done: If we focus on the middle class, first of all—first of all—they're the heart and soul and sinew of the country. If you focus on them and give them an even chance, the poor have a way up and the wealthy still do very, very well—still do very well. As I said, I'm a capitalist. But capitalism, when it turns to engaged in noncompetition, it ends up being just stealing. Let me close with this. I know you're thinking that I couldn't have been around very long. [Laughter] When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever before. I know the American story. I've seen it again and again, in contests between competing forces for the battle for the soul of this Nation. Some of you may remember when I ran in 2020, I got criticized by the press for saying I was running for three reasons: one, to restore the soul of America; two, to build the middle class so we can begin to grow again and everybody have an even chance; and, three, to unite the country. They're still my goals. They're still my goals. Audience member. That's why you're my President, Joe! The President. Well, thank you. Because the soul of the country is who we are. Look, you know, did you ever think—those of you who are over 40—[laughter]—did you ever think we'd be in a situation where we talk to each other like we talk these days? Why you see things that we see that, no matter how tense things were—and they're really tough in other parts of our history—when you ride down the street, and there's a Trump banner with a ""F- you"" on it—[laughter]—and a little—and a 6-year-old kid putting up his middle finger. [Laughter] Did you ever see—no, I'm serious. Did you every think you'd hear people talk the way they do? Look, it demeans—it demeans—who we are. That's not who—that's not America. Those between—those—look, those of us who want to pull America back at the past and those who want to move into the future. My lifetime has taught me to embrace the future—I mean it sincerely—freedom, democracy, a future based on the core values that have defined America: honesty, decency, fairness, equality, just treating people just fairly. No, I really mean it. We don't always live up, but that—there—that's the American creed. Donald Trump sees the story differently. He sees a story of resentment, revenge, retribution. I've been working like hell to unite Europe, NATO, and make sure Ukraine doesn't get crushed by this dictator in Russia. But you know, the fact is that you have a President who literally has invited Putin to do what it wants—do what the hell it wants if it could come into Ukraine. He thinks Putin is a strong—basically, he's a decent guy. You know who he's meeting with today in—down in Mar-a-Lago? Audience member. Orban. The President. Orban of Hungary, who has stated flatly he doesn't think democracy works; he's looking for dictatorship. The only member of NATO—that's who he's meeting with. I see a future where we defend democracy, not diminish it. I see a future where we defend our freedoms, not take them away. I see a future where the middle class has a fair shot and the wealthy pay their fair share. And I see a future where the planet moves from the climate crisis and our country away from the gun violence that we have so much of. I see a future where America remains the beacon of the world. I've been doing foreign policy since I was a kid in the Senate. I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. And I've gone now—I spent over almost 200 hours with the leaders of Europe, the heads of state. I know them all. I've known them well. And guess what? You know what every one of them says to me, virtually—except Orban—[laughter]—I'm serious—as we leave these meetings? Audience members. Four more years? [Laughter] The President. Well, indirectly. They grab my arm, and they pull me aside. I'm serious. They pull me aside and say, ""You've got to—he can't win again""—[laughter]—""because my democracy""—meaning their country—""my democracy is at stake."" ""My democracy is at stake."" Folks, above all, I see a country for all Americans, a future for all of Americans, a Presidency for all Americans. Because I believe in America. I believe in you, the American people. We just have to remember who in the hell we are. We are the United States of America. And there's nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. Thank you, thank you, thank you for taking the time to be here. Thank you. [At this point, the First Lady joined the President on stage.] By the way—by the way, you know, she talked about how she fell in love with me. The First Lady. Oh, no. No. The President. I had to ask this woman five times to marry me—[laughter]—five. And finally, the fifth time, I was down in South Africa trying to see Nelson Mandela when I was a Senator. I came back to her apartment in Wilmington, Delaware, when I got off the plane. I knocked on the door and said: ""Jill, you've got my Irish up. I'm asking you one more time."" [Laughter] ""Only one more time. Not when, but will you marry me?"" And she goes like this: ""Okay."" [Laughter] I tell you what, she did it. I married a Philly girl.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370532",2901,"Good morning. Just over a year ago, I launched my campaign for president. When I began, I said the campaign was grounded in my love for our country. Just last week, my mother, a first-generation immigrant, got to vote for her daughter for president. Only in America. I am filled with the gratitude for the outpouring of support we've received from all across our great country. But the time has now come to suspend my campaign. I said I wanted Americans to have their voices heard. I have done that. I have no regrets. And although I will no longer be a candidate, I will not stop using my voice for the things I believe in. Our national debt will eventually crush our economy. A smaller federal government is not only necessary for our freedom, it is necessary for our survival. The road to socialism is the road to ruin for America. Our Congress is dysfunctional and only getting worse. It is filled with followers, not leaders. Term limits for Washington politicians are needed now more than ever. Our world is on fire because of America's retreat. Standing by our allies in Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan is a moral imperative. But it's also more than that. If we retreat further, there will be more war, not less. As important, while we stand strong for the cause of freedom, we must bind together as Americans. We must turn away from the darkness of hatred and division. I will continue to promote all those values, as is the right of every American. I sought the honor of being your president. But in our great country, being a private citizen is privilege enough in itself. And that's a privilege I very much look forward to enjoying. In all likelihood, Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee when our party convention meets in July. I congratulate him and wish him well. I wish anyone well who would be America's president. Our country is too precious to let our differences divide us. I have always been a conservative Republican and always supported the Republican nominee. But on this question, as she did on so many others, Margaret Thatcher provided some good advice when she said, quote, ""Never just follow the crowd. Always make up your own mind."" It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that. At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people. This is now his time for choosing. I end my campaign with the same words I began it, from the Book of Joshua. I direct them to all Americans, but especially to so many of the women and girls out there who put their faith in our campaign: ""Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid. Do not be discouraged. For God will be with you wherever you go."" In this campaign I've seen our country's greatness. From the bottom of my heart, thank you, America. God bless you.","","",""

Here's what they are saying… New Hampshire Union Leader: Where there's smoke, there's fire: Nikki Haley is our choice for the 2024 First in the Nation Primary ""It would be challenging to dream up a more solid resume for a candidate to guide our country through the troubled world which we face. Nikki Haley has the deft touch and nuance necessary of a leader on the world stage."" Detroit News: Our endorsement for the Michigan Republican primary ""Meet Nikki Haley. The former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador could bring American politics back from the extremes.

Houston Chronicle: We endorse Nikki Haley for president of the United States in the GOP Primary ""For nearly an hour, Haley parried our questions, never fumbling for words or veering into vengeful incoherence like Trump. We didn't have to wonder what bit part American interests play in her quixotic bid for the most powerful position in the world. America, it seems — rather than ego, fame, greed or an oval-shaped shelter from criminal prosecution — is her chief concern."" Post and Courier: The Post and Courier: One GOP candidate can defeat Trump. Clear the field for Haley. ""Many presidential candidates have had more impressive foreign policy credentials than Ms. Haley. But the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations leaves the rest of this year's GOP field in the dust. And she combines experience with a hawkishness that our nation needs: one that will stand up to Hamas — and to Russia and China and all the other nations and players that are coalescing into an axis of totalitarianism and anti-Americanism. Unfortunately, we can't count on Mr. Trump for any of that."" Seattle Times: The Seattle Times editorial board recommends: In the GOP primary, Haley is only credible candidate ""Though this editorial board disagrees with Haley on most issues, she is an authentic public servant and a woman of substance. Better yet, she is not afraid of the former president. Washington Republicans who want to support a candidate of integrity would do well to support Haley in the state's primary.""","","",""

The mother of a veteran, Cosgrove said she appreciated that Haley is ""much more serious on foreign policy and where we get involved."" Both women said they were independent voters who were put off the GOP by the twice-impeached Trump, who also faces four criminal indictments, and has been held liable in several civil actions. ""I'm one of those women who had enough,"" Dewsnap, a financial adviser, said. Haley has ""very moderate stances and ""she's fair and honest."" WBTS: Nikki Haley makes appearance in Needham ahead of Super Tuesday She also detailed her thoughts on Massachusetts migrant housing situation and the Bay State's Right to Shelter law, saying, ""The amount of money Massachusetts is spending to take care of illegal immigrants is the same amount of money they could be doing to take care of their own homeless, mental health, to take care of the needs of the people of Massachusetts.

Since 2016, Trump's brand of anger and division has led Republicans to resounding electoral defeats year after year: In 2017, Trump threw his support behind Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race, only to see Moore lose in ruby-red Alabama to Democrat Doug Jones.  In 2018, Democrats netted 41 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, giving Nancy Pelosi the speaker's gavel for the second time in two decades.  In 2020, Donald Trump lost his reelection bid, and Republicans lost the Senate after Trump's drama cost the GOP two Senate seats in Georgia.  In 2022, Republicans predicted a historic red wave given Biden's historically bad poll numbers. Instead, Republicans took back the House with the thinnest of margins and lost key Senate races around the country. In 2023, Democrats kept Kentucky governorship and voters in Ohio codified the right to abortion in the state constitution.  In 2024, Republicans' razor-thin House majority got even slimmer when the GOP lost the special election in New York's Third Congressional District.  In 2024, powerful House Republicans are dropping like flies because they know Republicans won't keep the House with Trump on the ticket.","","",""

This isn't an anti-Trump movement; this is a pro-America movement. This is something where they're saying they're tired of the chaos.

That's not a small number, Jake. If you look at the early states, Trump didn't get 40 percent of the vote. In Michigan, after campaigning for eight years, he didn't perform as well as I did campaigning for just two days and securing 30 percent of the vote. This comes down to people worrying about the fiscal cliff we're heading toward. They're concerned about the younger generation, which is facing a $34 trillion debt and knows they'll have to bear that responsibility. They're anxious about the fact that the younger generation endured COVID, facing challenges and uncertainties. They're worried about securing employment, making ends meet, and doubting their ability to afford a home. With wars occurring worldwide, they want assurance that someone will dedicate eight years day and night to focusing on solutions, not on negativity or personal baggage. When you look at Joe Biden and Donald Trump, they're entirely immersed in their own worlds, preoccupied with how these issues affect them. It's not about either man; it's about the American people who have been ignored for far too long. They want things done right. I'm in Texas, and people here are vocal about the border situation, considering it unacceptable. This is the United States of America, and this should not be happening.""","","",""

""I was elected the first female minority governor in history,"" Haley says in the new ad previewed exclusively by National Review. ""Women, when they do something, they have thought about it, they know exactly what they're doing, how they're going to do it, and they get it done."" ""Strong girls make strong women. Strong women become strong leaders,"" the former South Carolina governor says as clips of her on the campaign trail meeting with young girls roll. ""When given an opportunity, women work hard and prove they deserve to be in the room every time."" Then a male voice explains Haley is ""trying to become the first woman of color nominated for president by a major party."" ""The only way we're going to win the majority of Americans is if we move forward with a new generational conservative leader that leaves the negativity and grievances of the past and moves forward,"" Haley says. Haley's campaign has frequently shared moments between Haley and young girls at her campaign events who have at times given her homemade friendship bracelets that say things like ""President Nikki"" and ""warrior."" ""This is what it's all about: the next generation. Nikki is in this fight to make sure the American Dream exists for every young girl, but she's also in this fight to prove that they can be anything they want to be,"" Haley spokesperson AnnMarie Graham-Barnes told National Review. ""Strong girls become strong women, and strong women become strong leaders."" Haley notched her first primary win in Washington, D.C., on Sunday after having survived eight consecutive losses to the former president in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, the Virgin Islands, Michigan, Missouri, and Idaho — and despite her major outside benefactor, Americans for Prosperity, pulling its financial support. Nonetheless, Haley's campaign pulled in more than $12 million in February. Ahead of her 20-point defeat in her home state last month, the Haley campaign sought to temper expectations, saying it had its sights set on a number of upcoming open or semi-open primaries on Super Tuesday. In an open primary, voters do not have to formally register with a political party ahead of Election Day in order to vote in that party's primary. In a semi-open primary, voters who are not affiliated with a political party can choose which party's primary they would like to participate in. Of the 874 delegates up for grabs on Tuesday, nearly two-thirds are in states with open or semi-open primaries, including Texas, Maine, and Virginia. Haley's campaign is eyeing several states that have a large contingent of college-educated voters, suburban voters, and independents, who tend to support Haley over Trump. Those states include Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia. Still, polls find Trump leading Haley by double digits in many of those states.","","",""

If you want something done, ask a woman."" Nikki Haley got a lot done this weekend. On Friday, Haley picked up the endorsement of two U.S. Senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Susan Collins of Maine. Voters in both Alaska and Maine will participate in their states' contests on Super Tuesday. Here's what they're saying:  USA Today: ""When all the fellas are falling in line, she showed why she's got a steel spine,"" Haley said of Collins during a rally at an Elks Club in Portland on Sunday, two days before Super Tuesday. ""Thank you for showing the fellas that you've got more balls than them,"" Haley said, to cheers from the crowd. The Hill: Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced Friday their endorsements for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the GOP presidential primary against former President Trump. NBC News: Pressed on why not, she said simply, ""Why not? … It's not just a situation where Nikki is the lesser of the evils. She is a qualified, competent, capable leader at a time when the country needs them. I refuse to accept that [Trump and Biden are] my only two choices."" Saturday and Sunday confirmed it yet again, Nikki Haley is the one candidate who can beat Joe Biden and get our nation back on track. New polls from the New York Times/Sienna and Fox News show her handedly beating Biden, while Donald Trump barely ekes out a statistical tie. Here's what they're saying:  Fox News: Haley fares better than Trump against Biden, receiving 50% to Biden's 42% for an 8-point lead. That's outside the margin of error. Politico: Notably, in two of the polls — the New York Times/Siena and Fox News surveys — former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley runs stronger than Trump in a head-to-head matchup with Biden. And finally, Nikki Haley notched a historic win in Washington, D.C. on Sunday night when she became the first woman to ever win a Republican presidential primary. She earned 19 delegates after winning nearly two-thirds of the vote. Here's what they're saying:  Axios: Nikki Haley makes history with D.C. Republican primary win CBS News: The win also makes Haley the first woman to win a Republican primary in U.S. history. As voters head to the polls on Super Tuesday, Haley continues to run full steam ahead, working diligently to earn every last vote.

Trump is actively rejecting people from the Republican Party...a losing strategy in November and a recipe for extinction in the long run.

On bringing the Republican Party back…  ""If the people want to see me go forward, they'll show it. They'll show it in their votes, they'll show it in their donations, they'll show it in the fact that they want us to continue to go forward. This is about really trying to get everyone to realize that this primary isn't between Donald Trump and Nikki Haley. Yes, on the ballot that's what you see. This primary is what is the direction of the Republican Party? Are we going to go where you had Donald Trump, he grew government, he didn't reduce the size of government, he put us $8 trillion in debt in just four years, more than any other president, and you're seeing a Republican Party follow him into that wasteful spending, not talking about fiscal discipline. This is about Donald Trump who believes that you should be more of an isolationist, that America doesn't need friends. That's his focus. My focus is we need to start respecting taxpayer dollars. We need to reduce the size of government. We need to put those resources more in the hands of the people. We need to start focusing on getting our kids reading again. We need to secure our borders and be a country of law and order. And we believe in peace through strength which means our focus is to prevent war. That's two very different Republican Party."" On having a government that works for the people again…  ""This is not a Never Trump movement. This is the fact that I see America going into a bad direction. One that's going off a fiscal cliff. One where our kids don't think they're ever going to be able to afford a home. One where we've got only 31 percent of eighth graders in our country reading. One where we have a ridiculously open border. And one where we're about to fall into war if we don't go forward. I think that's dangerous. I think that's not what Americans want. And that's what I'm trying to say is we need to stop this direction and go in a new direction where we can be safe and healthy, economic freedom, freedom of all types, so that we can have Americans that feel like they have a government working for them again."" On a president having total immunity…  ""I don't think there should ever be a president that has total immunity to do whatever they want to do. I think that we need to have someone that our kids can look up to, that they can be proud of. And I think we need to have a country of law and order, a country of freedom, and a country that goes back to respecting the value of a taxpayer dollar. And we don't know if the GOP frontrunner will follow the Constitution. Because I'm saying that's not the Republican Party. That is Donald Trump. If that is in question, that is for the voters to decide. What I am saying is I think we deserve better. Americans deserve better. We can't say that our only options are Joe Biden and Donald Trump. We can't. Two guys in their eighties, two guys that continue to put this division between America, two guys who haven't talked about a vision for the future, all they do is talk about each other in the past.

Trump's effusive praise includes encouraging Putin to invade our NATO allies, praising Chinese President Xi Jinping during COVID, absolving North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un of Otto Warmbier's death, and complimenting the Iran-backed terrorist group, Hezbollah, right after the October 7 attack on Israel. Trump's embrace of dictators: Dec. 20, 2015: ""In all fairness to Putin, you're saying he killed people, I haven't seen that. I don't know that he has. Have you been able to prove that? Do you know the names of the reporters that he killed?"" April 27, 2017: ""He [Xi Jinping] certainly doesn't want to see turmoil and death. He doesn't want to see it. He is a good man. He is a very good man and I got to know him very well."" April 30, 2017: ""At a very young age, he [Kim Jong-Un] was able to assume power. A lot of people, I'm sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. And he was able to do it. So obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie."" Sept. 21 2017: ""Thank you very much. It's a great honor and privilege – because he's become a friend of mine – to introduce President Erdogan of Turkey. He's running a very difficult part of the world. He's involved very, very strongly and, frankly, he's getting very high marks."" Sept. 29, 2018: ""[Kim] wrote me beautiful letters and they're great letters. We fell in love."" Feb. 28, 2019: ""I don't believe that he [Kim] would have allowed that to happen… And some really bad things happened to Otto — some really, really bad things. But he tells me that he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word."" April 2, 2019: ""President Xi, who is a strong man, I call him King, he said, 'But I am not King, I am president.' I said, 'No, you're president for life and therefore, you're King.' He said, 'Huh. Huh.' He liked that."" April 11, 2019: ""Kim Jong-Un has been, really, somebody that I've gotten to know very well and respect, and hopefully – and I really believe that, over a period of time, a lot of tremendous things will happen."" June 29, 2019: ""Well, thank you very much. It's my honor to be with a friend of mine, somebody I've become very close to, in many respects, and he's doing a very good job: the President of Turkey."" June 30, 2019: And I like President Xi a lot. I consider him a friend, and – but I like him a lot. I've gotten to know him very well. He's a strong gentleman, right? Anybody that – he's a strong guy, tough guy."" Oct. 1, 2019: ""Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China!"" Feb. 7, 2020: ""I just spoke to President Xi last night, and, you know, we're working on the — the problem, the virus. It's a — it's a very tough situation. But I think he's going to handle it. I think he's handled it really well. We're helping wherever we can."" Feb. 27, 2020: ""I spoke with President Xi. We had a great talk. He's working very hard, I have to say. He's working very, very hard. And if you can count on the reports coming out of China, that spread has gone down quite a bit. The infection seems to have gone down over the last two days. As opposed to getting larger, it's actually gotten smaller."" June 24, 2020: ""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!"" Nov. 11, 2023: ""President Xi is like central casting. There's nobody in Hollywood who could play the role of President Xi. The look, the strength, the voice… And Kim Jong-Un he's a tough smart guy."" April 11, 2023: ""These are top of line people at the top of their game. President Xi is a brilliant man… We had a great relationship. We get along so well. There was a great chemistry we had. Great. We talked about everything. A great chemistry."" May 28, 2023: ""Congratulations to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on his big and well-deserved victory in Turkey. I know him well, he is a friend, and have learned firsthand how much he loves his country and the great people of Turkey, which he has lifted to a new level of prominence and respect!"" Oct. 11, 2023: ""You know Hezbollah is very smart—they're all very smart."" Nov. 18, 2023: ""He walked up with a man who looks like a piece of granite, he's strong like granite, he's strong, I know him very well, President Xi of China. And he's standing there, you know he's a fierce—he's a fierce person. Now the press doesn't like it when I say good things about him, but, you know, what can I say: he runs 1.4 billion people with an iron hand."" Feb. 11, 2024: ""'Well sir, if we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us?' I said, 'You didn't pay? You're delinquent?' He said, 'Yes, let's say that happened.' No, I would not protect you. In fact I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay.""","","",""

Donald Trump barely squeaks by against a very unpopular Biden. ""Republicans cannot win with Donald Trump. He is barely squeaking by against a deeply unpopular president, while Nikki Haley wins by double digits. Donald Trump a few years ago would have called that losing,"" said Haley spokesperson AnnMarie Graham-Barnes. ""Nikki Haley brings people back into the GOP fold and easily clinches states Republicans haven't won in 20 years.

Key points from NYT:  Nikki Haley, Mr. Trump's Republican rival, who has made the case that he will lose in November, leads Mr. Biden by double the margin of the former president: a hypothetical 45 percent to 35 percent.   The share of voters who strongly disapprove of Mr. Biden's handling of his job has reached 47 percent, higher than in Times/Siena polls at any point in his presidency.   Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden are unpopular. Mr. Trump had a weak 44 percent favorable rating; Mr. Biden fared even worse, at 38 percent. Among the 19 percent of voters who said they disapproved of both likely nominees — an unusually large cohort in 2024 that pollsters and political strategists sometimes call ""double haters"" — Mr. Biden actually led Mr. Trump, 45 percent to 33 percent.  This follows yesterday's Roanoke College poll showing Haley up by 9 points in Virginia, a light blue state that's eluded Republicans since 2004.

More than $8 million of that was contributed by small dollar donors. Haley has seen contributions from all 50 states, and 95 percent of donations are less than $200. 2 U.S. senators: Haley picked up two big endorsements on Friday from U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Susan Collins (R-ME). The support of these two trailblazing legislators comes as their home states of Alaska and Maine head to the polls on Tuesday. 9 points: A new poll from Roanoke College shows, once again, that Nikki Haley wipes the floor with Joe Biden. The survey shows Haley up by 9 points in the light blue state that Republicans have not won since 2004. In contrast, Trump, once again, loses Virginia to Biden by 4 points. 2,000+: While Trump is occupied with legal drama, Haley is anywhere and everywhere. Yesterday, she held huge rallies in Washington, D.C. and Charlotte, drawing thousands of people to the two events. She continues her barnstorm today with stops in Raleigh and the Boston area. The most important number is 70: that’s the percent of Americans who say they don’t want a Trump-Biden rematch. Nikki Haley is in this fight because the future of the country is on the line. After eight years of chaos and personal vendettas, Americans are calling for a return to normalcy and a focus on the issues that matter: fiscal discipline and peace through strength.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374950",65661,"TRUMP: Ohh. Hello Greensboro. Hello, Greensboro. I'm thrilled to be back in beautiful North Carolina, with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots, that's what you are American patriots. We need a lot of patriots in this country based on the way we're doing. We need some patriots. Over the past few weeks, we've been on our rocket to the Republican nomination. It's been our rocket [cheers and applause]. I didn't win Iowa. You won Iowa. We all won Iowa together, in a record. We won it in a record. Double the previous record. That's not bad. New Hampshire, in a record, double the previous record, we actually got more votes than anybody in the history of the New Hampshire primary. That's pretty good. [cheers and applause]. We just won Nevada, and we got 98% of the votes. [cheers and applause]. Sorry about the 2%. We had an off day, we were missing 2%. The Virgin Islands. We won unanimously. Thank you, Virgin Islands. Beautiful place. Go to the Virgin Islands sometime. And one week ago, we won South Carolina, [cheers and applause], beating a certain governor by unprecedented numbers and getting double the number of votes of any previous candidate, in the history of South Carolina. How 'bout that? And as you know, today we have two contests. We have Missouri and we have the remainder of Michigan. And I will tell you in advance what just happened, because we just found out as I was coming up. Looks like we're winning 100% of both. 100%. [cheers and applause].100% can't we do better than that? And that adds on to last Tuesday's Michigan primary win, which was won with almost 77% of the vote, I think. 77%, something like that. Next up is Super Tuesday. [cheers and applause].That's on Tuesday, March 5th. That's in three days from now. And it's time for the great state of North Carolina. Don't forget, don't forget. My granddaughter is named Carolina, OK? [cheers and applause]. It's very important. We need each and every one of you to get the patriots from your family, your friends, everybody. Get them out, and turn them out to vote in record numbers because we have to show– what's happening on November 5th. That's when we have to get the worst president in the history of our country, the hell out of office. [cheers and applause]. The worst, the most corrupt. With your help, we will win big on Super Tuesday and this November, North Carolina is going to tell Crooked Joe Biden, Joe, you're fired. get out of here. Get out. Boom, get out. You're fired Joe. You've done a horrible job. You have done the worst job of any president in history. Get the hell out, Joe [cheers and applause]. And among my first actions upon taking office, will be to do a thing that sort of sounds like common sense, wouldn't you say? Not conservative, not progressive, not liberal. They don't like using liberal anymore, you know that? So let's call 'em liberal. The thing that I think probably works for the most of the people in this room, seal the border and stop the invasion of our country [cheers and applause]. Two days ago I was with Governor Greg Abbott at the Texas border– he's doing a good job– to witness the total devastation that Crooked Joe Biden has unleashed. Our border is an open and gushing wound. It's pouring drugs, gangs, terrorists and millions and millions of illegal aliens into our country. Yet Crooked Joe is fighting the state of Texas to stop them from defending our border. They're actually cutting the wire fences so that thousands and thousands of migrants can pour in. But as fast as they cut 'em, Texas steals them up [cheers and applause]. Pretty good. We love Texas, don't we like Texas now? [cheers and applause]. Wow. Now we have to do the same thing in Arizona, where the governor's doing nothing. And Gavin 'Newscum' [Newsom] the new scum [cheers and applause]. The Governor of California– sort of governor because they don't do much, I'll tell you. It's a shame what's happening to that beautiful place. But they– they're pouring into California. They're pouring into Arizona, as you know. But Texas has done a great job. And they have to stop because the people of Arizona don't want it. The people of California don't want it. They don't want it. When I'm president instead of trying to send Texas a restraining order, I will send them reinforcements [cheers and applause]. Three years ago, we had the safest and most secure border in U.S. history. We ended catch and release. You know, we had catch and release, right? We'd release them into our country now. Now we actually still have catch and release, but we release them in Mexico, OK. Is that better? That's what we had. But they gave it up. We built 571 miles of border wall. We got Mexico to send us 28,000 free-of-charge soldiers to secure our border. I said you gotta, you gotta give us our soldiers. They said no way. I said way, you gotta give us our soldiers. And they did while we were building the wall. We had the best border, think of it. Three years ago, we had the safest border in the history of our country. Today we have the worst border in the history of the world. There's never been a border like this. We had remain in Mexico. You think that was easy to get from Mexico? Mr. President, we'd like to have, you know, millions of people remain in Mexico. That's not that easy. We had it. Safe third agreements, asylum bans, title 42, and we had a thing called rapid removal. You know what that means, right? We had rapid removal. If you broke in, we caught you, we detained you and we deported you immediately. Just like clockwork. That's what happened. We had the best border in history [cheers and applause]. But let there be no doubt, this is Joe Biden's invasion. I'm not even sure it's him. I, I don't know. I'm not even sure he knows what the Hell's happening. I think it's the people that surround him. They surround that gorgeous, you know, the resolute desk. You know, you pick one of seven desks when you become president. Someday there'll be people in here, that young man right over there, I think he's got– maybe in particular the beautiful young woman right there. She'll be president. We'll have a woman president before then. You know what? If they cheat on the election, it might be Kamala [Harris] [cheers and applause]. I don't think that's too good. I don't think that's too good. Wouldn't that be something? Wouldn't that be something? Wow, what a thought. We better work harder and harder with it. We got enough problems with this guy. The very first bill that Crooked Joe sent to Congress was a bill to turn illegal aliens into voting citizens. Now he's pushing another mass amnesty plan while calling it border security. He calls it border security. Did you see the– look, he hasn't been to the border in many years, but he hasn't been during his presidency. And then I quietly announced I was going to the border, doing a show, Sean Hannity, good man, Sean Hannity [cheers and applause]. I have to tell you we like Sean Hannity. And we did the show. And we had a side-by-side. He went to an area where there's no problem because of Texas and us, but he went to an– and I went to an area where there was a big problem, very big problem. But he went, and he hasn't been there until he heard that I was going. And then he went, and he wasn't looking too sharp. He wasn't. They couldn't find– where do I stand? He goes, where do I stand? Your markers over there, Sir. Oh, where? I don't see it. Where is it? I don't see it. This is the worst– this guy should not be president. But we know that. These women from North Carolina, this is number 116. I don't know where the hell their husbands are. Where are they today? Oh, they're here. Will their husbands please stand up? These guys deserve a medal [cheers and applause]. Hi, fella. Nice looking husbands. That– the most– they follow me all over the place. I could go to China, and they might follow me. They might. They might not. I don't know. You're looking beautiful. Thank you. Isn't it nice to be in North Carolina where you don't have to travel? So how far, how far away is this from where you live? Two hours? That's not bad. That beats going to California, right? Ah, Thank you very– no they're unbelievable patriots, and they do– oh look, we have front row Joe's right here talking about travel. They may have your record beat. I'm not sure. Well, we appreciate we love front-row Joes and they're at a lot of rallies. I wanna tell you that. And we're having a good time, but we're really having a good time in a bad time, because our country has never been worse, and we're going to straighten it out. We're going to make it great again, and we're going to do it fast. But thank you very much for being here. I appreciate it. Great patriots [cheers and applause]. The bill, Joe Biden, once passed, would give him unlimited power to grant asylum to millions and millions of illegals. In other words, it's an automatic path to citizenship for all of the Biden newcomers, you know, they call them newcomers now, have you heard? Matt Gaetz, have you heard the new name? They call illegal aliens newcomers. No, you don't like that. Matt doesn't like it. Lauren [Boebert], no. No, no, they're new– o, this happened yesterday. They're saying the newcomers. Ohh boy. Oh boy. We're going to win by the biggest margins I think in history. We have to– gotta watch, watch the cheating, watch the cheating [cheers and applause]. But we have a man who's gonna watch the cheating. And he's gonna be introduced. And I heard him speaking a little while ago, and he happens to come from a place called North Carolina. You know who I'm talking about. He's gonna be the head of the Republican Party. He's gonna be great. And when the– when I watched Pennsylvania go, whoa, we're winning 73% of the vote in, we're winning by 800,000 votes yourself. All of a sudden, bomb, another one bomb, Georgia bomb, North Carolina was like a [signals flat line with hand]– it was a beautiful thing. What happened at that last election is a disgrace, and we're not gonna let it happen again. We're not gonna let it happen again [cheers and applause]. You ever noticed that they go after the people that want to find out where the cheating was, and by the way, 82% of the country understands that it was a rigged election, okay? You can't have a country with that. A poll came out, 82%, but they go after the people– they don't go after the people that rigged the election, they go after the people that looking, they're looking for the people that rigged the election. And that's the people they go after. They got away with something. They're never gonna get away with it again. Look what they've done to the country. Look at the damage. I always say you could take the 10 worst presidents in history, add them up and they will not have done the damage that this guy's done. What he's done to our country is horrible. And there's more spirit now than we've ever had in one or two, you know, we did much better the second time. I hate to say it. We got millions and millions of more people the second time. The spirit was unbelievable. 1st and 2nd. 2016 was an amazing time. 2020 we did much better, getting millions of more votes. I was told that we got the same thing. We couldn't lose, got millions of more votes, you know that. But we're gonna get uhh– this time spirit wise– I was asking my people backstage, who were there for both of them, I said, which was the best? They said this is blowing both of 'em away. So we gotta swamp 'em, all right? We're gonna swamp 'em [cheers and applause]. This is the opposite of the swamp that we took. This is a positive swamping. The Biden border bill would turbocharge the invasion, the continued invasion, of our country, and therefore his plan would totally demolish Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, healthcare and all public education. It's a disaster what he– he's taking this country down. But we won't let him destroy Social Security. I will not let him crash Medicare. It's gonna crash. I will not let him turn our public schools into migrant camps, which they're doing. You ever see the parks of our cities? They're migrant camps and I'll not let them turn the USA into a crime-filled, disease ridden, dumping ground, which is what they're doing. They're dumping [cheers and applause]. Everybody is being dumped into the United States of America. Every day Joe Biden is giving aid and comfort to the foreign enemies of the United States. He's actually giving aid. And they don't respect us anymore as a country. Three years ago, we were more respected than ever before, and now they have no respect for us whatsoever. And [Vladimir] Putin yesterday is talking about nuclear– did you hear that right? Nuclear. He wouldn't be talking about nuclear if I were here. He wouldn't be talking about it. Biden's conduct on our border is, by any definition, a conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America. You know, he talks about democracy. He is a danger to democracy. He is. Number one, he goes after his political opponent, which nobody's ever done in this country. They do it in 3rd world countries. Very well, they do it. But they're not gonna succeed with us. They're not gonna succeed [cheers and applause]. It's making us stronger. It's making us stronger. Biden and his accomplices want to collapse the American system, nullify the will of the actual American voters that established a new base of power that gives them control for generations. I don't know. Do you think he really thinks in terms of generations? I don't think so. I don't know. He's got a lot of bad fascists around him, though. That's what they like. They have a perfect– they have a perfect president. He'll do whatever they tell him to do. But Crooked Joe will not succeed with these plans, and he will not get away with these crimes. He'll be tried at the ballot box this November and he will be judged and convicted by the American people [cheers and applause]. All right. Under Biden, we now have a brand-new category of crime. It's called migrant crime. We have migrant crime. We have criminals that are going around having boxing matches with our police officers. Nobody's ever seen it before. Nobody. We have tough people coming in and you know that, and they're coming in from jails and prisons. They're emptying out all over the world. Last night they had four people coming in from the Congo. Where do you live in the Congo? What avenue do you live? Ohh, we come from a prison in the Congo. The Congo. We come from– they're coming from Africa. They're coming from Asia. They're coming from all over South America. They're coming from the Middle East. They're coming from China. 29,000 people in the last three months from China. They all happen to be of the age from 18 to 25. What the hell is going on with that? Now what's– you know, that's called military fighting age, right? That's called prime fighting age. Dana White of the USC says I like fighters from 18 to 25. That's what's coming in from China, 18 to 25. Last week, a beautiful 22 year old nursing student in Georgia, Laken Riley, I spoke to her parents, the most magnificent people, devastated and I mean, honestly, I hope they don't hear me say, they can never be the same. They can never be the same. She was barbarically attacked while she was out on her morning run. She ran to keep herself in great shape. She was a nursing student, the number one, best. She's just– brutally, you read about it, it's a, big story now. She was brutally assaulted, horrifically beaten, kidnapped and savagely murdered. Almost beyond recognition. Can you imagine this? The monster charged in her death is an illegal alien migrant, who was led into the country and released into our communities by Crooked Joe Biden. We had him locked out. It was very hard to get into our country three years ago. Now, it's real easy. It's real easy. We mourn her terrible loss and we send our love to Laken's family. And they are incredible people. I can tell you that. In Texas a few weeks ago, another illegal alien animal was charged with sadistically murdering a 16-year-old Texas High School cheerleader. Beautiful, beautiful young woman. Stabbing her to death in her home, dumping her body in the bathtub to be discovered two hours later by her mother. And last Sunday in Louisiana, a savage Biden migrant criminal was charged for raping a 14 year old girl by holding a knife to her throat before going on to repeatedly stab a local man in the face, all over his face and his back, while robbing him as he was getting out of his car. This Biden migrant was arrested while standing in the middle of the street, drenched in blood. And it was the blood of his victim. Not one more innocent American life should be lost to migrant crime. Gotta stop it [cheers and applause]. It's a new category. Migrant crime. We call it Biden migrant crime, but it's frankly, it's too long. So we call it migrant crime. I come– I came up with that name 'cuz I come up with a lot of good names, don't I? [cheers and applause]. But you know, it's migrant crime. It's a whole new category of crime, and it's probably gonna be more vicious than anything we've seen. These are vicious people. They're from jails. Many of them are from jails. Many of them are from mental institutions. We uhh– this is what they're dumping into the United States. And I know the people, the leaders of most of these countries. I know them and they're very street wise. They're very wise. They can't believe Biden's the president. They can't even believe it. And they're taking advantage of our country. They wanna clean out their jails. You– jails all over the world, you take a look at their prison population, jt's way down because they've taken people out of those jails, and they've dumped them into our country. They've taken people out of their mental institutions and insane asylums, you know what that is? That's– somebody said, what's the difference? I said insane asylum is like mental institution on steroids. That Silence of the Lambs, did you ever hear of a fine gentleman named Hannibal Lecter? Hannibal Lecter. Does anybody know the name? Please raise your hand. Yes, well, that's what they have in insane asylums. And they're dumping them into a community near you. Hehe, lots of luck. This is not good. This is not good. That's why your central question in this election is whether the foreign armies Joe Biden has smuggled across our border will be allowed to stay, or whether they will be told to get the hell outta here and go back home. We'll take 'em back home [cheers and applause]. Take 'em back home. In Venezuela, did you just see [Nicolás] Maduro? Venez – uh it's unbelievable– Venezuela comes out and said uh, we're dumping all our criminals into the United States, but the second part, we're never taking 'em back. Don't ever bring 'em back. They talk– They're not going to tell me that [cheers and applause]. They're not going to tell me that. We brought, we brought MS-13 back by the thousands. By the thousands. They said, we're not taking them back. You know what Biden said? Oh, they're not taking them back. Oh, oh. The guy can't find his way off a stage. Stairs all over a stage. You've heard this. One, two, three, four [points around the stage]. And then you could jump off the front if you have to. And he'll find the only place on a stage where there's no stair. If Joe Biden's illegal alien migrants do not go back to their countries, we will never get our country back. But we're gonna take 'em back. Because they're not gonna go back. We're gonna take 'em back [cheers and applause]. Fast. It's gonna happen quickly. Local police, you know the local police know every one of 'em. Somebody said, how're you going to do that? It's not the Washington thing, i's local police. First of all, we're giving our policemen immunity from prosecution, because when they stop crime they get prosecuted [cheers and applause]. They take away their house, their pension, their family. They lose their wife or husband. On day one of my administration, I will terminate every open border policy of the Biden administration and we will begin the largest, domestic deportation operation in American history because we have no choice, we have no choice [cheers and applause]. And so under Joe Biden and his thugs are so, desperate to stop us because they know that we are the only ones who can stop them, we will stop them. They are bad people. They use weaponization of Justice Department, let's go after my political opponent cause I can't speak. I have– I can't communicate. I can't debate. I can't stand at a location that they tell me. I keep falling down when I walk up a flight of stairs. That's why they're weaponizing law enforcement for high-level election interference, where Joe Biden goes after his political opponent. He should drop all charges against me. You know, every one of these 91 counts, they, they're not 91 counts. They're not legit. They're Biden counts. He worked with Fani [Willis], even though spelled fanny. F-A-N-I, Fawwwni. How 'bout that one? How 'bout that one? With her lover. Nathan Wade, her lover [booing]. Let's go get Trump. Because if they go after Trump, he– they can pay him more money. And then she can take beautiful trips on the sea, beautiful trips to foreign islands. Her and her lover. They have such a good time. The guy got paid almost $1,000,000 and he never did it before. But he did the other thing before, that he did with Fani. He did plenty of that. That's what he's good at, I guess. And this was before, long before they– so they cooked up these charges early. They said let's get a high-level individual so we could charge the state more money. That's what happened. Ohh. And then when they get caught, she's ohh well, I paid him back. Ohh, how? In cash, I gave him cash. Really? Say you gave him cash? By the way, if she gave him cash, that's even worse. Because where the hell did she get the cash, right? I paid him back. Because if she didn't pay him back, she committed a big crime because she got money that she gave through the state. So she said she paid him back. She didn't do– That charge should be dropped. They should all be dropped and they worked closely with the Department of Justice, you know, he went there, for two eight hour visits and then numerous other visits. But he was there, in there, all day long, in the White House, White House counsel. This was the scheme of the White House. The Manhattan DA, he took his number one guy, number one guy, and put him into the Manhattan DA's office. Does Matt Gaetz know that? He put his number one guy into the Manhattan DA's office. That's not the Manhattan DA, that's all being run by the Department of Justice for election interference. Knock out your political opponent. It ain't working. The one thing they didn't know is the people of our country, hear about it from me. Most people don't talk about it. When this happens to most people, these kind of things, if they're politicians, they walk up to a microphone and they say, ladies and gentlemen, I will fight for my name and reputation, but right now I'm going back to my family and you never hear– With me we don't do that. We tell you, we tell you what it's all about [cheers and applause]. And our poll numbers have skyrocketed. I never heard about being indicted before. Being indicted, me? I went to the Wharton School of Finance, I was really good. I did all these things then they ind– and it was all like in this little short period of time. I got indicted over a tiny little period of time in my life, tiny little bit. Four times. That's more than Al Capone. That's more than Alphonse, you know who Alphonse Capone is? He was the meanest guy. He was a very volatile mobster in Chicago, affectionately known as Scarface. He was a very nice man. He was not– if he didn't like you at dinner, if he thought you were smiling in a mocking way, you were dead. He got indicted less than I did. He killed lots of people. He killed them just for sport. Now, but the people understand it, cause I can talk about– I have a voice, I can talk about it. Uh, we had the thing in Washington, deranged, Jack Smith, he's a process– he's a deranged human being. He has a huge record of failure, because he goes so far out, and people end up not being convicted, he goes too far. He's a man– he's a– just a terrible human being. But he's a deranged person who wants to hurt people. And we, we're hurting him. I'll tell you, we're hurting him. He stinks. That's not the kind of people– You know, being a prosecutor is a very important thing, being a fair and good prosecutor is a very important thing. But some of these animals, I mean, they are bad. But what they've done is, it's all coming out of Crooked Joe Biden 'cuz, look, he can't campaign. He can't campaign, he can't speak, he can't walk, he looks like hell. And I will say this, before my indictments, I talk much differently about him. They know front row Joes know, right? A big change in course. I used to, you know, I had respect for the office of the President. And if you listen to MSDNC and CNN, they're all getting no ratings now, which is great. But if you listen to them, and if you go back a year, they were all saying, well, no, you can never indict Trump on this. They indicted me. You could never indict him on January 6th. They indicted me. You could never indict him on the document, hoax. I come under the Presidential Records Act. I'm allowed to do all of that. I'm allowed to do whatever I want. New York Times did a story. Please, please, please. Mr. President, please, could we have our boxes? And if the president says no, he doesn't have to give 'em. But think of this. Think of this. Joe Biden was totally exonerated last week. He's got 10 times the documents, and they're classified, and he's not under the presidential– and they exonerated him. Of course they said he was grossly incompetent, but we don't have to get into that. But that'll come up, you watch. But we'll, we'll be in very good shape So– a man who totally violated every law in the book on classified documents, who had many of the documents stored in Chinatown. And by the way, did you see those boxes? Those boxes were seriously used. They were used. Those boxes, they had a lot of stuff taken out. They weren't just boxes, Matt. Those boxes had stuff coming in and out. Where's Hunter [Biden]? Where is he? Where's Hunter? No, they had stuff coming in and out and they were stored in Chinatown. They also had 'em under his beautiful Corvette. The Corvette was dumping grease all over 'em. They were in the garage here– it's one of those doors that cost very little money that you can take a scissor and cut. Whereas mine were at the Great Mar-a-Lago. I had Secret Service all over the place. I had a locked door. You know, they asked me, could I put another lock? I– we showed them, I said here's where they're stored, take a look. They looked. They said, could you put an extra? We had a good lock there. We had Secret Service, they said. Could you put an extra lock in? And I said, sure put an extra lock. They wrote me a letter. Thank you very much. Put an extra lock– and then they raided Mara Lago after that. These are bad– these are bad people. These are bad people. And you're not allowed to do that according to the 4th Amendment, you can't do that. All of this is only happening because I'm running for president and we're leading in the polls. Otherwise, we wouldn't be having any of this [cheers and applause]. We wouldn't be having any of this. In the latest Morning Consult poll, we're at 81% in the Republican primary, although I, I must say, we shouldn't be talking–. I haven't heard about this woman [Nikki Haley] for the last five days since, since we beat her actually in her home state so badly, in a record, we beat her in a record. Are you from there? Yes. Since we beat her there, and then in Michigan, in the largest vote, primary vote in history. We beat her by 42 points, and I haven't heard about her, so I won't even use– people say don't even talk about it– [inaudible], but I have to. When I have some– I have to talk, front row Joes. Because she's bad news. I know her very well. She's very average. In the new Emerson Hill poll of the general election, we're crushing Joe Biden in every swing state, including a big lead here in the great state of North Carolina. [cheers and applause]. We're killing it. And in Harvard Harris, we're leading Crooked Joe in a six-point,– that's considered a landslide. And you know when I'm leading by 6 points, it's really much more. I hate to say why. People don't wanna get involved. Who are you voting for? None of your business. Anybody that says none of your business is voting for Trump [cheers and applause]. I hate to say, I shouldn't say that, but when they say it's none of your business, that means they're voting for Tru -- The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024 [cheers and applause]. Every time the radical left Democrats, Marxist communists, and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor. I'm being indicted for you. I am. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. I stand before you today, not only as your past and hopefully future President, but as a proud political dissident, and as a public enemy of a rogue regime. This is a rogue and dangerous machine. This is a anti-democratic machine. These people are thugs and they're bullies, and what they've done to people, you heard the hostages singing. That was the hostages– they're the J-6 hostages I call them, 'cuz they're hostages. They're policemen. They're firemen. They're accountants. They're lawyers, in some cases, they're put in jail for extended periods of time, for very long periods of time. They're hostages. You heard them singing. You heard the spirit that"," they had. That spirit is unbelievable. That song became the number one song, and you, you can check me on– you know, they always check my facts, the– ohh look at all that fake news [booing]. It's a lot of– that's a lot of fake news back there. Wow. Uh-oh, the red lights are starting to go off. Anytime I start talking, they take the red light off. You know, it's hard when CNN, of course, nobody's watching CNN or MSNBC, but it's hard, when I'm starting, getting ready to talk about CNN, the light [inaudible] is– they're very good at it now. They get it off just in time as I'm about to say that they're ratings challenged, they get it off, but there's not too many people watching anymore. You know, the truth is they've lost such credibility that they don't have the same power that they used to have. Never forget our enemies want to take away my freedom, because I will never let them take away your freedom [cheers and applause]. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. And I won't. And in the end, they're not after me, they're after you. I just happen to be standing in the way. Oh, it's so pleasant [cheers and applause]. You know, I had a nice life before this, right? Right? Front row joes. I had the nicest life, great company. I did a great job, built this beautiful company, some of the best places in the world. Lots of good things. Everybody I hope is on Truth, because Truth is hot Truth Soc– [cheers and applause]. It's hot. That's– I call that the real voice of America. It's called the real voice of America. It is. Truth is doing great. I hope you go on it. You ask the press, every one of them are on it, I said to 'em, who's not on truth. Nobody raised their hand. They hate to do it that way though, they hate– but they're all on truth. So I hope you are. We are delighted to be joined today by an incredible gentleman who I saw about four years ago. And he went to a town hall meeting. He was not a politician, which I think is his advantage. But he was a great natural speaker, a man who is a very outstanding person, you know, he uh– he drove a truck. I think it was a forklift. And he went over taxes. Was it a forklift? I love forklifts. They're power– those suckers. They could lift it. What the hell? I watch all these guys, Mark, working out. They're working out. They can never top a forklift right? I'd rather drive a forklift and lift this way. But he drove it, and he drove it well. But I guess he was complaining about taxes in his town. And he got up and he made his speech. And they didn't care too much about what he said. They just said, this is the greatest speaker we've ever heard. Would you like to run for Lieutenant governor or something? And he ran¬– look at him he's laughing– he ran, and he's been an unbelievable Lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson [cheers and applause]. I heard him, and by the way, his wife is much, much more lovely than he is. I can tell you that is, she's my friend. Thank you, darling, for being here. But you know, I heard him coming in on the plane, I was listening and I said to the people on the plane watch this, this is Martin Luther King on steroids. Okay. Now, I told that, I told that– I told that to Mark, I said I think you're better than Martin Luther King [Jr.]. I think you are Martin Luther King times 2. And he looked at me, and I wasn't sure. Was he angry? Because that's a terrible thing to say? Or was he complimented? I have never figured it out, but I'm telling you, he's one– right? When I said that to you, you looked like, I don't know if I like that comment. You should like it, because you are outstanding and you're going to be the next governor, so that's going to be very cool [cheers and applause]. Now you know the fake news will go today, and they'll take that little statement that I make. That little cute statement and they'll say, he said, that this gentleman is better than Martin Luther King, that's a terrible thing. Is he a racist, a ba-ba-ba [waves hands around]– I'll end up being–. I don't care, it doesn't matter. Because the people, the people get it. Mark, the people get it. Thank you, Mark. And that was a great speech you made too. And I appreciate it very much. Another man who's done unbelievably, and he's really respected in Washington. People didn't know him too well in the state, and then I endorsed him, and they got to know him very well. But he was in a little corner of your state, and he was a Congressman, and he was a great Congressman. People loved him. Matt Gaetz wanted him. Jim Jordan wanted him. A lot of great people wanted him. A lot of great people. And I didn't know as much about him as I should have, and I met him and I liked him, and he's been an unbelievable senator. We endorsed him and he won, pretty easily too. And just like they liked him in the area where they knew– it's always nice when they love you in a Congressional District. Typically, it's not good when they don't like you, and then you're taking somebody for higher office. But they loved him, and now the entire state loves him. US Senator Ted Budd. Thank you, Ted [cheers and applause]. Thank you, Ted. Great. Doing a great job. Thank you very much, Ted. And then you have Dan Bishop. And I watched his speech, [cheers and applause], and I said, boy, that's good. And I endorsed him a number of years ago for Congress, and now I guess he's running for Attorney General. And I said whenever you're ready. And uh, he is fantastic. He's– from day one he's been fantastic. And I loved your speech. You're gonna clean up the streets, you're gonna clean up. Can we bring him to New York? I wish you were our Attorney General. We have a real bad one in New York. We have one that's highly progressive, and she's killing business and killing everything. They're all fleeing. So I think we're gonna maybe move you– stay here for about a year, we're gonna move you into New York. But Dan Bishop is great and I'm sure that he's gonna win that. And he has my total support, my total endorsement, everything else. Thank you, Dan [cheers and applause]. And a woman who's, who's been a longtime professional and respected by everybody and loved by everybody. Virginia Foxx. Virginia, thank you. Loved by everybody. And Lauren, you're gonna do fantastically in your district. Lauren Boebert [cheers and applause]. Thank you. Lauren's from afar, but she's here and she's with a friend of hers and a friend of mine, a, a man, by the way I introduced him the other day in South Carolina and he got a big hand. I said, what's that all about? He happens to be from Florida. But he was there. He's, he's been so loyal. He's been such a great friend. He follows me not because he likes it, but because he wants to make sure we get elected. And he's been incredible. But he– I introduced a lot of people and some people did well, some people didn't get such a good hand. This guy got a tremendous hand 'cuz he really is a great patriot. Matt Gaetz and his wife, Ginger [Gaetz] [cheers and applause]. Matt Gaetz. True, true. I– only true Matt. The speaker of your North Carolina House, Tim Moore [cheers and applause]. Good– did a good job today. Thank you, Tim. That was a good job you did today. I watched you. And the next Congressman from the 6th district, you know, I met him because he's a friend of my sons. And he had a tragic event with his brother. I shouldn't even say it, but he did. With fentanyl, it got him. It got him. His brother passed away recently. And I liked the kid right away, and my son felt [inaudible] – my son knew him for a long time. And he's a good hunter, and all of that. And my son likes hunting. And I like hunting, too, but a different kind of hunting. We like hunting for votes. We want to hunt for votes because we gotta win this election. But Addison McDowell is great [cheers and applause]. Stand up. Addison, please. Good. Good luck. Good luck. Your brother's watching you. He's watching you, and he's proud of you. He said, wow, that guy has gone places, so I think you're gonna be very successful and good luck. And your brother is indeed watching you right now. Your North Carolina GOP chair. So I had a choice of a lot of people and I said, this is the guy because he stopped the steal, he stopped the steal. He stopped– you know I say protect the vote. They make ballots, they drop ballots, they do so many things to cheat, 'cuz who can get elected with high taxes, open borders. Take away your rifles. Take away your guns. No protection for yourself, no entertainment. With bad education policies. Everything is woke. They can't. The only way they get elected is to cheat, and they cheat like hell and they're genius at it. But this man stopped it in North Carolina and he happens to be your chair, but now he's gonna be the GOP chair. He's going on to big things. Michael Whatley. Big things. And I said, Michael, I don't need any votes. We got all the votes we need. Just make sure that they don't drop boxes of ballots all over the place. Make sure he's gonna make sure I I have great confidence in him. We don't need any votes. We got plenty of votes. And also fantastic guy, Sheriff Sam Page [cheers and applause]. Where is this [inaudible] ? Oh, he's a, he's a popular guy. Well, you're a popular guy. Look at that. Whoa. Thank you. And I met a lot of sheriffs backstage. It's, you know, we've got almost, almost 100% of law enforcement, as you know, endorsement. Sheriff, thank you very much. But we have 'Sheriffs for Trump'. We don't want to mess around with these guys. They're great. Thank you. Sheriffs for Trump, thank you. Thank you very much, Sam. Thanks. Stand up please [cheers and applause]. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Great people. They're great people, our law enforcement is great. And as I told you, when we do deportation, they know the real bad ones, they know all the locals– they know by their first name, their second name and their middle name, wouldn't you say? They know the good ones and the bad ones, and they're gonna be working with the federal government on getting them the hell out of here because we can't– no country can sustain what– the abuse that we've been given by this horrible, horrible worst President in history. On Tuesday get out and vote for Mark Robinson for Governor, Dan Bishop for Attorney General and Virginia Foxx, Tim Moore and Addison McDowell for Congress [cheers and applause]. They have my complete and total endorsement. Get out there and vote. Thank you everybody [cheers and applause]. Thank you. From the very first day that we take back the White House from Crooked Joe Biden, I believe we're going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country. We're gonna do it fast. We're gonna do it fast. You know, one of the opponents, long gone, one of our Republican opponents said, well, I can serve for eight years and it's gonna take eight years. I said let him get that expression out a little bit longer and then I'll hit him with it. I said, listen, if it takes eight years, you don't want to vote for that person because this should take a year. We're going to get everything done in three months, six months, and a year, and we're going to start drilling, we're gonna start, drill, drill, drill, drill, baby, drill [cheers and applause]. Day one. You know, he kept our drilling policies because gas was so going– going so high in gasoline, that he went back and let– you know, he should do the same thing on the border, by the way, but he kept our drilling policies and started taking it away– the prices shot up, he said, we better go back to Trump's drilling, but you have no idea. We're gonna drill, we're gonna get prices down so low– because it all started with this stupid energy policy. The cost of energy went up so high, the cost of oil and gas. In our first term, we appointed over 300 federal judges and three great Supreme Court justices. I kept my promise to the workers of North Carolina and we ended the disaster known as NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made, and we replaced it with a brand new USMCA, Mexico and Canada. The best trade deal ever made, a giant win for farmers and manufacturers. A tremendous win for North Carolina, as you people tell me all the time. I took on Communist China like no administration in history, bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into our treasury when no other President had gotten even 10 cents from China, and our farmers were a big beneficiary of, which you have a lot of farmers here. But in Iowa, I won by a record number, because our farmers realized what we did for them. We got them $50 billion from China. Nobody ever thought it was possible. For our great veterans, we passed VA accountability and VA choice [cheers and applause]. That was a big deal. On accountability, as you know, you, you had 9000 people in the Veterans Administration that were sadists and thieves and bad guys, bullies, and you couldn't fire him because of civil service. I had it passed through Congress. We fired 9,000, we're replacing it with great people with heart that love our veterans. And then and then choice– It would take six months to get to see a doctor you couldn't see– they have great doctors there, believe me, they have great doctors. But you couldn't get to see 'em. Anybody that can't see a doctor within 24 hours immediately goes outside, gets a local doctor. We pay the bill, we negotiate, but we pay the bill. And we saved many lives. We got a– we got a 92% approval rating on the VA, that's the highest it's ever been by 45 points [cheers and applause]. That's the good news. The bad news? I hear that Biden is dismantling it. He's dismantling choice, and dismantling choice would be a very bad– and he's putting some of the bad people back. OK, I heard that also. We fully rebuilt the US military and created space force. And I was the 1st President in decades started no new wars. Instead, I brought our troops back home. As you know, we knocked out ISIS, we took ISIS, we knocked 'em out [cheers and applause]. We got 'em out. We got 'em out. [Addressing crowd member who fainted and medical personnel]. And take your time, fellas. Take your time. We have a great person up here. You just take your time. Have plenty of time. Thank you very much. Thank you. That's great. These people do such a great job. Thank you. You you're doing OK. He looks good, he looks good to me. I'll tell you his hands up. Thank you. Thank you. Don't forget they wait for four days outside. And then they get in here and they say, Gee, Trump's really no good, this is not worth it and they, they don't feel so good. But he's great. Thank you, fellas. You take your time. You are more important right now than all of us. He's got a Trump, he's, he's pointing to his hat. You better believe it. Yep, America. You know these people, the doctors, the medics, first responders, they're incredible people, incredible people. They do such a job [cheers and applause]. You all saw the guy yesterday on the crane coming in and save the truck. Did you see that? The truck went over the bridge? And they dropped the boom and the crane, and they saved the driver of the truck who was hanging perilously over the bridge, it was a tough, tough thing. Right? It was an unbelievable job they do. Unbelievable. Because everybody in this room is so important, you know that, right? There's a lot of people in here, by the way. That's a big crowd you couldn't get– they have 2000 people outside. We have 2000 people outside, there's a lot of people. They couldn't get 'em in. That's great. Thank you. Take good care of him. That's great. That's great. Thank you. You're not gonna miss much, don't worry about it. Thank you, man. You take care of yourself, alright? That's great. Give him a hand, everybody. [cheers and applause]. Incredible. They wait a long time. That's great. And that's really nice. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody. [Medical staff take crowd member out of room]. [Speech resumes, directed back towards audience]. Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we, we win the Presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled, and we will restore peace through strength. I will immediately end Joe Biden's war on American energy, and we will quickly end his inflation nightmare. What he's done to prices doesn't matter. By the way, you know the stock market's gone up. There are big professionals, some of the people I know the biggest smartest guys on Wall Street. You know why it's going up? Because they think I'm going to win the election, and if we don't win the election, you're going to see what happens. You'll end up in 1929. To lift up North Carolina workers, I will revoke Chinas most favored nation trade status and we will impose penalties on China and other abusers. We have trade abusers. [Looks toward something happening in the crowd, walks to side of stage]. Thank you. Thank you. [Crowd and Trump clap as medical responders leave the building with a crowd member]. TRUMP: Did you see, uh, that medic was unbelievable. The way he was working, boom, boom, right? [cheers and applause]. That's unbelievable. That's an incredible job woah. Unbelievable. That's what we have in this country. It's like incredible that– that's a bad one right there. There we go. I, I think he's gonna be alright. But boy, that was– did you see him working? He was working. He knew what he was doing. He was, he was doing a job to get him going. Get that, get that heart going. He wanted to get that heart going. Wow. And his children walked out with him. Can you imagine that? So it's– what a great job. Thank you very much everybody. Ooh, that was a bad one. I will pass– doesn't sound as important now, right? But it is. Everything's important. I will pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, if China or any country makes us pay a 100 or 200% tariff, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff of 100 or 200% right back [cheers and applause]. In other words, if you screw us, we will then screw you [cheers and applause]. It's very easy. Very simple. It's a very simple plan. Very simple plan. China charges us 100% and 200% and others do, India's very, very, a very big abuser. Brazil, they charge us. We don't charge them. We were charging them a lot. We took in billions of dollars. We took hundreds of billions from China. We never took in any thing. And as the tariffs on foreign countries go up, taxes on American workers and families will come down dramatically, because we will be taking in a lot of money. You know, we have this tremendous deficit. We're not gonna have much of a deficit. We'll do the reciprocal trade act. That's gonna get rid of a big chunk of our deficit. And you won't have to pay a damn thing [cheers and applause]. You won't have to pay a thing. Don't let the fake news tell you that it costs you, no. It doesn't cost you. We will restore law and order in our country. And I will direct a completely overhauled DOJ to investigate every radical out of control prosecutor in America for their illegal, racist and reverse enforcement of the law [cheers and applause]. There is no law. This week, Joe Biden once again declared his intention to strip our police officers of their qualified immunity by passing a radical anti-police bill through Congress. By contrast, I am going to indemnify all police officers and law enforcement officials throughout the United States, to protect them from being destroyed by the radical left for taking strong action on crime [cheers and applause]. We are going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety and beauty better than they have ever been before. Our citie are going in a direction that nobody ever thought possible. We're gonna rebuild our cities. We're gonna work with Democrat mayors. They're all run by Democrats. But we're gonna work with them, and we're gonna rebuild our cities. We'll take over our horribly run capital, the capital of our nation, Washington DC, and clean up, renovate and rebuild our capital cities so that it no longer is a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world. We're gonna get rid of the slums. We're gonna clean out the slums. We're gonna get rid of tent cities all over the beautiful parks. And we're going to make it so if somebody from North Carolina goes to Washington to see the great monuments, they're gonna go and they're not gonna be, they're not going to be killed or beat up or accosted. It's a horrible place right now what they've done, and as we clean up our capital, we'll clean up and clean out our deep state. We started with [James] Comey, we got Comey out, we got a lot of people out. But that is a deep swamp. We started, we got Comey out, didn't we? We got him and a lot of others out. But it is deeper than, deeper than anybody thought possible, right, man, isn't it? On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children [cheers and applause]. And we will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate [cheers and applause]. I will keep men out of women's sport [cheers and applause]. And we will fully uphold our great and very important but under siege, Second Amendment, and I did it for four years [cheers and applause]. We will protect innocent life and we will restore free speech and I will secure our elections. Our goal will be one-day voting with paper ballots and voter ID [cheers and applause]. And all Republican governors should go to that right now. But until then, Republicans must win. We want a landslide. We have to win. We have to win so that it's too big, to rig, too big, to rig. Too big to rig. So if you want to save America, you have to go vote and you have to vote. I hate to say it–. I'm not gonna tell you who to vote for– Vote Republican. I won't tell you. Vote Republican. Remember the primaries this Tuesday, so go out and vote. We have to send the signal. We have to send the signal. November 5th is the big day. That's– we're gonna have this guy walking out. He's destroyed our country. He's destroyed our country, our reputation. He's destroyed everything he touches and he is indeed, you know, they like to say Trump is a threat to democracy, Trump. He doesn't even know what it means. His incompetence is a threat to democracy. He's a threat to democracy. He's letting Fascists run our country. He's letting Communists run our country. Get everyone you know to the polls so we can trounce Haley, if she's, if she's– I haven't heard about her in about a week. Has anybody know? She was going around every show Donald Trump, and, Donald Trump, this and that, that wasn't working too well. Now we don't care about that. We– you have to get out the vote because we have to send big numbers up for November 5th. We have to let them know that we're a freight train and we're going and we're not stopping [cheers and applause]. We're gonna focus all of our time, and all of our energy, we will fire Crooked Joe Biden. That's what we have to do [cheers and applause]. Crooked as hell, OK? How about what's going on in Congress now? Isn't that something? No I didn't do this, I didn't do that. Joe didn't know about it. He didn't know about it. He didn't know about anything. I didn't know it. I didn't really know about it. Remember when, uh Hunter, remember we used to go 'where's Hunter?' At least now we know where he is. Where's Hunter? But, uh, the famous phone call, right? My father's sitting right here, I want that stuff set right away. Together, we're taking on some of the most menacing forces and vicious opponents our people have ever seen. But no matter how hateful and corrupt the communist and criminals are, and they are hateful, we are fighting against some of the most vicious people in the world and they're not outside, they're inside. You know what? If you have a smart president, outside's, not a problem. We can handle China. We can handle Russia. We can handle. All of them. They don't wanna mess around with us. Now they do because they're toying with us. But you must never forget this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you [cheers and applause]. This is your home, this is your heritage, and our American liberty is your God-given right. From Asheville, to Raleigh. From Wilmington, to Winston Salem. From Greenville, to Greensboro, this state was forged by some of the toughest men and some of the strongest women ever to walk the face of the Earth. Our American ancestors were backcountry farmers and frontier settlers, woodsman, craftsman, workers, and warriors who poured their love into this land for their families. They climbed the mountains, fought the battles. Conquered the dangers, such danger. Tamed the unknown wilderness, built the factories, and gave everything they had to make America into the greatest nation in the history of the world. [Trump pauses, as somber music begins playing in background]. CROWD: [chanting] USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. TRUMP: But now, we are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that has the highest inflation in 50 years, where banks are collapsing, and interest rates are skyrocketing. Likewise, we are a nation where energy costs have reached the highest levels in our history. We are no longer energy independent or energy dominant as we were just a few short years ago. We are a nation that is begging Venezuela and others for oil. Please, please, please help us, Joe Biden says. Yet we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation, anywhere in the world. We are a nation that just recently heard that Saudi Arabia and Russia will repeat your uhh– will be reducing their oil production, so sad, while at the same time substantially increasing the price. And we met that threat by announcing that we will no longer be drilling for oil in large areas of Alaska or elsewhere on our beautiful land. We are a nation that is consumed by the radical left's Green New Deal. Yet everyone knows that the Green New scam is fake, and will only lead to our destruction. We are a nation whose leaders are demanding all-electric cars, despite the fact that they don't go far, cost too much and whose batteries are produced in China, with materials only available in China, when an unlimited amount of gasoline is available inexpensively in the United States, but not available in China. And now we are a nation that wants to make our revered, and very powerful army tanks the best in the world, all electric. So that despite the fact that they are also not able to go far, fewer pollutants will be released into the air as we blast our way through enemy territory in an environmentally friendly way. And they also want to make our fighter jets with a green stamp of energy savings. They're losing 15% efficiency, but allowing us to keep our enemies' atmosphere clean of emissions as we viciously, and unceremoniously attack them at levels never seen before. Who are these fools? Who are these people that would do this to us? Who are these people who would ruin our country? We are a nation that ended oil exploration and production in the United States, just as the price of oil reached an all-time high. What other country would do such a foolish and self-destructive thing. Can we be energy-independent? Can we be energy-dominant again? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And quickly, says President Trump. Oh yes. Oh yes. And quickly. We are a nation that surrendered in Afghanistan, leaving dead soldiers, American citizens, and $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment in the world behind. And also abandoning Bagram, one of the biggest military bases anywhere in the world and only one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. And we are a nation that allowed Russia and Ukraine to fight, killing hundreds of thousands of people, and it will only get worse. It would never have happened with me as your President and for four straight years, it didn't happen. Likewise, the horrifying attack on Israel would never have happened. They wouldn't even have thought of doing such a thing if President Trump was sitting in the Oval Office. It would not have happened. Iran was broke under the Trump administration. They didn't have the money to fund Hamas and Hezbollah and all of the other instruments of terror that they were funding. They had no money. They were broke. But those sanctions were lifted by a corrupt Biden administration, and now Iran is a rich country with $221 billion in cash, and another $6 billion for hostages, and $10 billion for electricity to Iraq. All complements of an incompetent and corrupt Biden administration. And China with Taiwan is next. We are a nation that allows radical left terrorists to violently attack our cities, leaving behind massive destruction and death. And nothing happens to the criminals that do these terrible things. There is no punishment. But when people who love our country protest on January 6th in Washington, they become hostages unfairly imprisoned for long periods of time. We are a third-world nation now, that has weaponized its law enforcement against opposing political parties like never, ever before. We've got a Federal Bureau of Investigation that won't allow bad election-changing facts to be presented to the public and which offers $1 million to a writer of fiction about Donald Trump, to lie and say that it was fact where Hunter Biden's laptop from Hell, was Russian disinformation. And the FBI knew it wasn't. But 51 intelligence agents said it was. And a Department of Justice that refuses to investigate egregious acts of voting irregularities and fraud. And we have a man who is totally corrupt, and the worst president in the history of our country, who is cognitively impaired and in no condition to"," lead and is now in charge of dealing with Russia and possible nuclear war, which would be World War Three and far more devastating than any of the wars previous, because of the weaponry, that no one wants to even think or talk about. It is weaponry like no one has ever seen before. We are a nation that no longer has a free and fair press. Fake news is all you get, and they are indeed the enemy of the people. They refuse to discuss the Biden crime family, but enjoy covering the false indictments of Donald J Trump, who has done nothing wrong except win an election that he was not supposed to win. We are a nation where free speech is no longer allowed and where crime is rampant and out of control, like never ever before. We are a nation that is allowing Iran to build a massive nuclear weapon, and China to use the trillions of dollars that has taken from us to build a military to rival our own. And less than three years ago, we had Iran, China, Russia and North Korea in check. They respected us. They were afraid of us. They weren't going to do a thing against us, and everyone knows it. Now Russia and China are holding summits to carve up the world. And perhaps most importantly, we are a nation that is no longer admired, respected, or listened to on the world stage. We are a nation that in many ways has become a joke, and we are a nation that is hostile to liberty, freedom, faith, and even to God. We are a nation whose economy is collapsing into a cesspool, through it, whose supply chain is broken, whose stores are not stocked, whose deliveries are not coming, and whose educational system is ranked at the bottom of every single list. We are a nation that just sold a once great company, United States Steel, to Japan. We are a nation whose stock markets continued success is contingent on MAGA winning the next election. If they don't win, you'll have a situation like 1929. You will have a Great Depression. I believe that with all my heart we are a nation where large packs of sadistic criminals and thieves are allowed to go into stores, and openly rob them, beat up, and kill their workers and customers, and leave with armloads of goods but with no retribution. Where the authority of our great police has been taken, where their families and pensions have been threatened and their lives would be destroyed for the mere mention of the words law enforcement. We are a nation where fentanyl and all other forms of illegal drugs are easier to get than groceries to feed our beautiful families. We have become a drug-infested, crime-ridden nation which is incapable of solving even the simplest of problems. We will institute the powerful death penalty for drug dealers where each dealer is responsible for the death, during their lives, of over 500 people or more [cheers and applause]. Mothers will never again be forced to watch their children overdosing and hopelessly dying in their arms, screaming, what can I do? What can I do, my child? What can I do? We are a nation whose once revered airports are a dirty, crowded mess. You sit and wait for hours and then are notified that the plane won't leave, and they have no idea when they will. Where ticket prices have tripled. They don't have the pilots to fly the planes. They don't seek qualified air traffic controllers, and they just don't know what the hell they are doing. We are a nation that screens its citizens viciously at all ports, but if you're an illegal alien, you are allowed to flow through our southern border by the millions and millions. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, willpower and strength. We are a nation that has lost its way, but we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Three years ago we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again [cheers and applause]. It was hardworking patriots like you, who built this country, and it is hardworking patriots like you who are going to save our country. We will fight for America like no one has ever fought before. 2024 is our final battle [cheers and applause]. With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state. We will expel the warmongers from our government that is so poorly run. We will drive out the globalists. We will cast out the communists, Marxists, and fascists, and we will throw out the sick political class that hates our country. We will route the fake news media. We will drain the swamp and we will liberate our country from these tyrants and villains once and for all. Like those patriots before us, we will not bend. We will not break. We will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up and we will never, ever, ever, ever back down [cheers and applause]. With your support, we will go on to victory the likes of which no one has ever seen before. We will evict Crooked Joe Biden from the White House, and we will take back our country on November 5th, 2024 [cheers and applause]. The great silent majority is rising like never before, and under our leadership, the forgotten men and women will be forgotten no longer. You weren't forgotten for four beautiful years. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together we will make America powerful again [cheers and applause]. We will make America wealthy again [cheers and applause]. We will make America strong again [cheers and applause]. We will make America proud again [cheers and applause]. We will make America safe again [cheers and applause]. And we will make America great again [cheers and applause]. Thank you very much. Thank you. North Carolina. Go out and vote. God bless you all. God bless you. God bless you all. Thank you.",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370530",3447,"If there's one thing Utahns can agree on, it's that America needs a new direction. Everywhere you look, we're heading deeper into chaos. Too many students don't know how to read or do basic math. Too many families can't afford groceries, much less a first home. Our southern border is utterly lawless. We have murders in our cities, fentanyl on our streets and children being killed by stray bullets. There's war in Europe and the Middle East. It threatens to spread further — and draw America in. In this time of crisis, there's another thing we can agree on: America can't afford a rematch between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. They're incapable of solving the problems we face, and we all know why. They're dividing the country instead of uniting us. One calls his fellow Americans vermin. The other calls his fellow Americans fascists. They're stoking fights instead of inspiring Americans to unite in the fight for a better future. If we hope to reach that future, we must move beyond the failed candidates and ideas of the past. Biden has turned the country upside down and brought the world to the brink of war. His weakness has cost the lives of American soldiers — first in Afghanistan and now in Syria. Meanwhile, Trump is insulting our military heroes and veterans and has invited Russia to invade our allies. We need a president who restores the strength that leads to peace, not one who encourages war. For that matter, we need a president who unleashes the strongest economy on Earth. Biden is crippling our economy with corporate welfare and out-of-control spending, while Trump added more national debt in four years than any president ever. Now he wants a 10% tax hike on every American. Families don't need even higher taxes and prices. We need real relief, and we need it now. A stunning 70% of Americans don't want neither Trump nor Biden to be president. We know what they'll do. But we also realize who they are. Most Americans know that Trump and Biden are too old. They stumble over words and forget world leaders. That's not who you want in the Oval Office when Russia launches a nuclear weapon at our satellites or China shuts down our electricity grid. The presidency is the most demanding job in human history. You don't give it to someone who's at risk of dementia. You give it to someone who's disciplined — who can work day and night for eight years straight. You give it to someone who's fighting for America, not themselves. I'm running for president to save America. Both Trump and Biden want me to drop out, but I will stay the course until Utah voters have the chance to make their choice in the primary election on March 5th. I ask that you put your trust in me. I will keep up the fight until Americans speak. I've always been a fighter, as governor of South Carolina and as America's Ambassador to the United Nations. And I'm married to a fighter who reminds me every day about the urgent need to defend America. My husband, Michael, is a major in the South Carolina Army National Guard. He's currently deployed in the Horn of Africa. It's the same region where Iran's terrorist proxies are launching missiles at American troops. He and his brothers-and-sisters-in-arms are serving and sacrificing for the sake of our country. We honor them by choosing a new direction for America. Utah can make that choice on March 5. And I will keep fighting to restore an America that's strong, proud and united in purpose.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370500",3569,"By: Michael ShepherdOnline Here U.S. Sen. Susan Collins voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in Tuesday's Republican presidential primary, becoming only the third member of Congress to back the longshot challenger to former President Donald Trump. Collins, a longtime Trump skeptic who was one of seven Republicans to vote to convict him on a Democratic impeachment charge related to the Capitol riots of Jan. 6, 2021, backed Haley in a Friday statement in response to questions from the Bangor Daily News. She called Haley ""extremely well-qualified"" to be the first female president. ""She has the energy, intellect, and temperament that we need to lead our country in these very tumultuous times,"" Collins said. The senator's support contrasts sharply with the rest of her party, which has coalesced behind Trump as he has won each of the first four nominating contests. Haley has vowed to stay in the race at least through Tuesday, keeping a busy campaign schedule to argue that the divisive former president cannot beat President Joe Biden in the November election. She will visit Portland for a Sunday night rally, coming two days before the Super Tuesday primaries in Maine and 14 other states that will decide whether she has any path forward. Trump was supported by 77 percent of likely Maine Republican primary voters to just 19 percent for Haley in a poll released earlier this month by the University of New Hampshire. Collins has a complex relationship with Maine's Republican base. She has never faced a primary since winning her seat in 1996 and routinely keeps ties with state lawmakers. Conservatives circled around her during a massive 2020 challenge from national Democrats, but she was censured by several county party committees after voting to convict Trump. The senator said she would not back Trump after he became the presumptive Republican nominee in 2016, but she avoided saying how she was voting when she shared the ballot with him four years later. Early in the 2024 primary process, Collins ruled out voting for Trump but declined to endorse any of his many competitors, saying they were her friends. She held that position even as Trump maintained huge leads in national polls and the field began to winnow. Haley, who served as Trump's United Nations ambassador and is now the only well-known Republican taking on the former president, and she ruled out running a third-party bid under the No Labels banner in a Friday discussion with reporters. ""If I were to do No Labels, that would require a Democrat vice president,"" Haley said, according to Axios. Most of the candidates who have dropped out have backed Trump, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. Besides Collins, Haley's only congressional endorsements have come from Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Collins ally who only announced her support on Friday. All of it probably comes too late to make a major difference in the nominating race, with Trump averaging 79 percent support in national polls, according to RealClearPolitics. That is despite Trump facing four pending criminal cases, including on federal charges alleging he sought to overturn his 2020 defeat ahead of the Capitol riots and mishandled classified documents. Biden has a similarly large lead in Maine's Democratic primary ahead of Tuesday. He was behind Trump in a Maine poll released earlier this week and has generally trailed the former president in recent national surveys amid voter concern about his age of 81.","","",""

In her interview with CNN's Dana Bash, Haley stressed that her campaign isn't about being against something—it's about being for conservative policies, for a strong Republican Party, and for a hopeful and free America. Watch her interview here: On being a true conservative…  ""I defeated a dozen of the fellas because I focused on each and every one of them getting out. The last one was always going to be Donald Trump. The goal was always to get this one-on-one with Trump. What you're hearing me say now is a contrast. That's what people want. They want to know the differences.  ""I am not anti-Trump. I am for America, and the direction America can go. If you look at the Republican Party, I believe in fiscal discipline. I believe in smaller government. I believe we need to stop the wasteful spending. Donald Trump didn't shrink government, he grew government. He put us $8 trillion in debt in just four years, more than any other president. He is not talking about fiscal discipline or debt. ""I believe national security is about peace through strength. Donald Trump is talking about holding hands with Putin as he invades our allies. He's talking about isolationism. I don't believe in that.  ""I believe that we should have a country where the American Dream is possible and that we don't have this tent of anger and division. Joe Biden and Donald Trump have both led into that."" On moving the Republican Party and the country forward… ""Primaries are about options. We had a couple of thousand people in Virginia yesterday. And you have people saying, 'thank you for giving me someone to vote for.' They want someone who's going to give a hopeful America. They want someone who's going to get results. They don't want someone with the drama and the vendettas and the negativity. They want someone that's just going to get America normal again. They're worried about their kids"" …. ""He [Trump] doesn't focus on fiscal discipline. We're going down a fiscal cliff. We're now paying more money in interest than we are a defense budget. Russia, China, and Iran pay attention to that. As much as he rails against government, he didn't shrink it. He didn't clean it up. He didn't do anything.  ""We've got wars around the world. Literally, the world's on fire. And you're talking about stepping away from our allies and siding with a tyrant? You're talking about becoming more isolationist? You're going to make Americans think that they have to choose between Ukraine and Israel over the southern border, when the reality is we need to do all of those things and we can?  ""It's the whole idea that you're getting away from what it takes to move America forward and you're taking them backwards. And that's not what the American people want. You can go to any of our rallies. The majority of these people are not anti-Trump. They're worried about what country they're giving to their kids. They're worried about how their kids are going to feel. They see the anxiety, stress, and depression their kids have because the kids don't feel anything hopeful because of what they hear and see.

In a new digital ad, titled ""Sinking Ship,"" Haley lays out the facts for the GOP. There's a choice between chaos and division, or a new generation of conservative leadership and a return to normalcy. Watch the video here.  ""The Republican Party has never been about one man or one woman, it's always been about America, and how we can work together to make sure our best days are ahead of us,"" said Haley national spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. ""Nikki's in this fight because she knows the ship is taking on water, but she's not going to let it go down without a fight."" Since 2016, Trump's brand of anger and division has led Republicans to resounding electoral defeats year after year: In 2017, Trump threw his support behind Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race, only to see Moore lose in ruby-red Alabama to Democrat Doug Jones.  In 2018, Democrats netted 41 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, giving Nancy Pelosi the speaker's gavel for the second time in two decades.  In 2020, Donald Trump lost his re-election bid, and Republicans lost the Senate after Trump's antics cost the GOP two Senate seats in Georgia.  In 2022, Republicans predicted a historic red wave given Biden's historically bad poll numbers. Instead, Republicans took back the House with the thinnest of margins and lost key Senate races around the country. In 2023, Democrats kept Kentucky governorship and voters in Ohio codified the right to abortion in the state constitution.  In 2024, Republicans' razor-thin House majority got even slimmer when the GOP lost the special election in New York's Third Congressional District.

When July 4, 2026, arrives, what kind of country will we have? Will we celebrate what America has achieved and where we're headed? Or will we mourn what America has become and what we've lost? If Joe Biden is president, America's 250th anniversary will surely be grim. He'll worsen the problems he has created. Families are already struggling to buy groceries and pay their mortgages. The southern border is flooded by immigrants, drug runners and terrorists. Cities are filled with crime. There's war in Europe and the Middle East and the threat of war in the Pacific. If Biden is president on our 250th anniversary, there's no telling how bad the crisis will be. Americans know we must defeat Biden. Only a little more than a third of the country approves of the job he's doing. Those Americans see that he's running the country into the ground. But I'm running for president to save America. Donald Trump can't, because he'll lose to Biden in November. Trump is dividing our country when we need to unite. He calls his opponents ""vermin."" He threatens people who don't support him. He has driven away suburban voters, contributing to Republican losses in 2018, 2020 and 2022. A stunning 40% of Republican primary voters don't support him, even though he's basically an incumbent. That's not how you win in November. The polls are clear: I beat Biden by double digits. On a good day, Trump is even with Biden, and he doesn't have many good days. Trump will sink Republican candidates nationwide, from the U.S. Senate to school boards, like he's done in every election since 2016. He'll give us four more years of Biden — and God forbid, Vice President Kamala Harris. There was a time for Trump. I proudly served America in his administration. I voted for him twice and supported many of his policies. But Trump's time has passed. Even if he could win, he's not able to tackle the crises that will destroy our country. The next president needs to put our fiscal house in order. We're $34 trillion in debt, and if we keep doing nothing, we will devastate our economy and bankrupt our people. But Trump added $8 trillion to the national debt. He wants to add more. So does Biden, who has put us on track to add $2 trillion to the debt every year. I'm not afraid to say the hard truths and make the hard choices. We must stop pork barrel spending, end corporate welfare and bailouts, and veto Congress' budget blowouts. Trump and Biden have never done that and never will. I did as governor of South Carolina. I will again as president. Most of all, the next president needs to keep America safe. Biden can't. His debacle in Afghanistan led to war in Ukraine and the Middle East. But Trump is dangerous, too. He praises dictators who want to destroy us, such as Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-Un. He says we have to abandon our allies to secure our border. Trump is wrong — America can do both. We can secure our border and stop war from spreading. In fact, we don't have a choice. If we let Russia win in Ukraine, it will encourage Putin to invade our NATO allies, China to encroach on Taiwan and Iran to continue attacking Israel. Trump is demanding that Republican senators abandon Ukraine, and many are following his demand. What will they do when he demands they abandon Israel? We cannot let this future come to pass. We must make America strong and safe. It's the only way to prevent war. We must defeat Biden in November. And that means the Republican Party must move beyond Trump. On Super Tuesday, we must chart a new direction — one of unity and progress, not more division and decline. I am ready to chart that course. I am ready to leave the failed ideas and leaders of the past behind and move our nation into the future. That starts on Super Tuesday and continues on Election Day in November. And when we mark the 250th anniversary of America's founding, two years from now, we deserve to live in a country that is strong and proud and united in purpose.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370235",3696,"OREM, Utah — At a press gaggle in Utah yesterday, Nikki Haley talked about how the Republican Party should be about conservative principles, not one person, and declared her support for a Republican Party that still believes in fiscal discipline, limited government, and the idea of peace through strength. She condemned Trump's efforts to turn the Republican National Committee into his legal slush fund instead of focusing on helping all Republicans get elected. Haley on the direction of the Republican Party...   ""So the reason this is so important is it's a primary. And in a primary, you're deciding which direction the Republican Party is going to go. Which direction is the country going to go? So what you're looking at with this change, and we're also seeing it as McConnell goes to the other side, is we now have a Republican Party that is shifting. ""The Republican Party now doesn't say anything about fiscal discipline. The Republican Party started under Donald Trump where they spent $8 trillion in debt in just four years more than any other president. But it set the tone because what happened? Republicans went and opened up earmarks and pet projects for the first time in 10 years. In the 2024 appropriations budget, you can't ignore Republicans spent $7.4 billion on earmarks and Democrats spent $2.8 billion. At no point is Donald Trump talking about shrinking government. It expanded under his watch. At no point is he talking about shrinking our agencies. They expanded under his watch. At no point is he talking about wasteful spending. They've continued to do more. ""And we're also seeing a shift in the Republican Party on national security. We used to be peace through strength. We used to believe in our alliances. We used to understand that America could never be so arrogant to think we don't need friends. And now you're watching a Republican Party that's going more towards isolationism, thinking that we'll just stay in our own bubble. But the Republican Party I believe in, believes you're better together with an alliance. The Republican Party I believe in believes that when you go out and you become in your bubble that you put yourselves more at war, not less."" Haley on the RNC supporting only Donald Trump and not down ballot races...   ""And then we have to talk about the Republican Party itself, the RNC. So if Donald Trump's going to take over the RNC, then what does that mean? Now, Lara Trump said the RNC is now just about Donald Trump. So I assume that means that the Republican Party is shifting, that before it was supposed to support races up and down the ticket, now it's just about supporting Donald Trump. ""And what's going to happen when that happens? Does it become his legal slush fund? Are you going to ask the question about what happens with that resolution that says you can't spend it on legal fees? He's very upset about that resolution. But what I would tell you is all Americans and Republicans especially, deserve a vote on the record on that resolution. We deserve to know how the RNC is going to spend their money and if it's going to go towards legal fees. He's very upset about that resolution. But what I would tell you is all Americans, and Republicans especially, deserve a vote on the record on that resolution. We deserve to know how the RNC is going to spend their money and if it's going to go towards legal fees. ""So the Republican Party that I am seeing happen is one that isn't focused on fiscal discipline, is one that isn't focused on national security, and is one that's becoming more about one is one that isn't focused on national security, and is one that's becoming more about one man instead of about a party.""","","",""

When asked about the potential economic impact that would have on businesses that rely on immigrants, Haley pointed to legal immigration as a way to address this, saying, ""We need to do it based on merit, based on what we need so that our economy can grow, so that we can fill those jobs that we don't have right now."" Haley has yet to win a state in the GOP primary, trailing front-runner Trump in both delegate count and polls.

Every day Joe Biden and Congress refuse to fix the border crisis, is another day America's national security is at risk. Haley called on Congress to get in a room and do its job instead of blindly listening to Trump who demanded Republicans sit on their hands so he can use the border crisis as a political cudgel in the election. Once again, Trump is putting himself ahead of America's national security.   ""Let's talk about the border. Denver has had more illegal immigrants come here than any city in America. Per capita. It is unbelievable what is happening. I can't believe this is the United States of America. When I was governor of South Carolina, we passed the toughest illegal immigration law in the country. President Obama sued us over it, and we won. ""But it can never be acceptable that we had nine million illegal immigrants come across that border. We had more fentanyl come last year than would kill every single American. Number one cause of death for adults 18 to 45? Fentanyl. And don't think for a second China doesn't know what they're doing when they send it over. So I want to take what we did in South Carolina and I want to go national with it. I want to do a national E-Verify where every business has to prove that the people they hire are in this country legally. ""Let's defund sanctuary cities once and for all. We're going to put 25,000 border patrol and ICE agents on the ground and let them do their job. We're going to go back to the Remain in Mexico policy so that nobody can step foot on U.S. soil. And instead of catch and release, we're going to go to catch and deport. That is how we will stop the battle for the border. ""So look at what happened last week. Congress had a border bill. Now that border bill had a good part about it. It strengthened asylum laws. We need to strengthen asylum laws. Three million illegal immigrants came in under Trump's watch because the asylum laws weren't strong enough. But where it was weak, it didn't have the Remain in Mexico policy. We need that. And it had a 5,000-person threshold. We can't even have a one-person threshold. We can't have anybody coming across the border over here. But what went wrong is Congress should have gotten in the room, strengthened the bill, and not left until they got it done. But what happened? Donald Trump comes in, says don't pass anything until after the general election, and Congress went home on vacation for two weeks. We can't wait. We can't wait one more day to pass a strong immigration bill. We've gotta get it done. Congress needs to do their job, and Trump needs to stay out of it, period.""","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370217",7515,"By: Suzanne Bates and Samuel BensonOnline here Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley told the Deseret News and KSL editorial boards Wednesday if voters want an option besides President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump on the ballot, they're running out of time. ""The reason I'm running is because I think that Americans deserve a choice. If you come to any of my rallies, you'll hear Americans desperate for a choice. But you know, this is the chance to make that choice,"" she said. They will not get the chance to vote for her as a third party ticket. On Wednesday, Haley offered her most explicit rejection yet of a potential No Labels run: ""No. I'm a Republican. You go on a No Labels ticket, what does that mean? A Democrat vice president. That's not who I am. I'm a conservative. I've always been a hardcore Republican. I think that this is about the party and this is about the country, and the only way to do it is to do it the right way."" Super Tuesday falls on March 5, when Utah and voters in 15 other states and territories head to the polls. Utah voters will choose their presidential candidate through a caucus. After meeting with the Deseret News and KSL editorial boards, Haley was scheduled to meet with supporters at a private event, then speak at a rally at Utah Valley University. Haley framed the primary elections as a battle over what the Republican Party will look like in the future — and said on its current trajectory, it is becoming a vehicle for Trump, rather than a party united around principles. As she continues to lose states to Trump, but manages to capture 30%-40% of Republican votes in each state, Haley said that's evidence Trump can't unite the Republican Party behind him — and she said that will make him unelectable in November. He hasn't been able to reach independent voters or women, who abandoned him in 2020, she said. She repeated her charge that the ticket in November shouldn't be between ""two 80-year-old candidates,"" because that will result in Vice President Kamala Harris eventually assuming the presidency. Trump is 77 and Biden is 81.Haley: Donald Trump 'can't win' the general election — a 'sinking ship' for the GOP The Republican Party has faced a series of electoral setbacks or outright losses in the years since Trump was elected in 2016. The party's candidates underperformed in 2018, 2020 and 2022. Haley placed the blame for those losses squarely on Trump's shoulders. ""Republicans and Americans need to look at the fact that maybe if we keep losing, maybe Donald Trump is the reason we keep losing,"" she said. Haley wasn't just talking about elections when she made that comment, she was also referring to recent losses in congressional debates over spending, the border and foreign aid. ""I have said this, and I truly believe it, there will be a female president of the United States — it will either be me, or it will be Kamala Harris. And if Donald Trump is the nominee, we can all welcome the president, Kamala Harris, The battle in the Republican Party is about more than the presidency, she said. ""This is about which way do we want the Republican Party to go?"" Haley said. Trump is hurting Republican candidates' chances at the ballot box, and he has turned the party into a ""ship with a hole"" in it, she said. ""And we can either see the hole for what it is, and take the life raft, or we'll go down with the sinking ship,"" Haley said.Haley: 'I don't judge' Trump voters Haley pitches herself as the candidate who can avoid ""chaos"" and return stability to American politics. But Trump commands dominant leads in polls and has won each Republican primary and caucus to date by double digits. When asked what drives Republican voters to support Haley, she noted she voted for Trump twice and was ""proud to serve America in his administration."" ""But the reality is, he will not win a general election. That's a fact,"" Haley said. ""You can't have 30% to 40% of the vote in every one of these early states that you lose."" She theorized that Republican voters are backing Trump because ""they feel like he fought for them, and now they feel like they're fighting back for him."" ""Republicans saw that Donald Trump didn't get an ounce of peace or a moments' credit,"" she said. She added that she doesn't judge voters who choose Trump. ""You're not supposed to judge the people you want to serve,"" she said. ""You're supposed to communicate what needs to happen.""Trump, RNC shouldn't use campaign funds to pay legal fees, Haley says Haley noted that Trump's campaign and affiliated super PACs spent over $60 million on his legal defense. She referenced a draft resolution at the Republican National Committee, first reported by The Dispatch, that would restrict the RNC's ability to foot Trump's legal fees. ""Now, it's very important that every state look at how their state's committee members vote on this,"" she said. ""And I've said this vote needs to be on the record. Everybody needs to see exactly how they vote."" When asked if she thinks Trump will go to prison, she demurred. ""I don't know what's going to happen,"" she said. ""I don't pay enough attention to the lawsuit, to the court cases. I think some have been overly politicized. I think in some, he's going to have to defend himself.""Voters 'should care' about morality, character of candidates Attendees at Haley's events in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina often say they support Haley because they want to see a person with good moral character in the White House. When asked if the Republican electorate at large weighs character when considering who to vote for, Haley said they should. ""That's why I'm running,"" she said. ""I mean, I think that we're better than this. And I think that, you know, America has an amazing ability to self-correct. Sometimes we have to hit rock bottom to know where up is. We're there. Now, we just have to see if everybody's willing to go up.""On debt, foreign aid Haley accused Trump of not focusing on spending and debt, while saying those are critical issues for the future of the U.S. ""Donald Trump continues to not talk about the debt, or the spending. We are now borrowing money to make our interest payments. China owns some of that debt. We're now paying more in interest than we are in our defense budget. That's a problem,"" she said. She also said Trump is ""literally siding with (Vladimir) Putin, saying that (he'll) encourage Putin to invade our allies. That means Donald Trump would consider siding with a man or half a million people have been wounded or killed because of the invasion of Ukraine. He's going to side with a dictator who kills his political opponents. He's going to side with a tyrant that takes American journalists and holds them hostage. Putin has made no bones about the fact that he wants to destroy America. And Donald Trump's gonna sign with Putin over our allies that stood with us after 911. And then more than that, look at the direction of the party.""How long will Haley stay in the race? Last week, while campaigning in South Carolina, Haley vowed to stay in the race through Super Tuesday. After losing the South Carolina primary, she reiterated that plan, though she admitted she is not thinking beyond this Tuesday, when 16 states and territories will vote. ""As long as 70% of Americans say they don't want a Trump-Biden rematch, I'm going to keep fighting,"" she said. ""This is bigger than one person. This is about the direction of our country. This is about the direction of our party.""","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370238",4411,"CHARLESTON, S.C. — Donald Trump has a problem, whether he wants to admit it or not: 40 percent of the Republican primary electorate wants nothing to do with him, and he is doing absolutely nothing to bring them into his increasingly shrinking tent. In fact, Trump seems to be doing everything he can to repel them. Here's what people are saying… Wall Street Journal: Donald Trump's Divided Republican Party Yet Ms. Haley won nearly 40% of the vote, which as she said in remarks Saturday evening ""is not some tiny group."" That's especially true running against a quasi-incumbent who was endorsed by nearly every GOP official in the state. None of them want to risk getting a primary challenge if they fail to bend the knee to Mr. Trump. Yet as in New Hampshire, the size of her vote shows that millions in the party don't want Mr. Trump back in the White House. Politico: Hidden in Trump's big South Carolina win: A not-so-small problem for him in November With about three-quarters of the expected vote in, some 40 percent of voters rejected Trump. That number itself isn't a problem in a primary. But it includes some serious reasons for concern in a general election. Trump lost moderate and liberal voters to Haley by a wide margin, according to exit polls. And, according to AP VoteCast, a bit over 1 in 5 GOP primary voters said they would not vote for Trump in November if he was the party's nominee. The Hill: Farah Griffin: Haley's South Carolina results should be a 'five-alarm fire' for the GOP ""Somebody who's running as virtually an incumbent — Donald Trump — getting 60 percent, and 40 percent being against him? That's not a mandate,"" she said. ""Especially with the entire Republican party apparatus behind him, with most elected Republicans behind him."" George Will: Despite anticipation of a Trump nomination, Super Tuesday demands to be heard In the state that has the nation's most rapidly growing population, the two places where the electorate most resembles the nation's are Charleston and Columbia. There, Haley received 62 percent and 58 percent, respectively. It is likely that a significant number of Trumpkins value the prospective satisfaction of defeating Joe Biden more than the immediate fun of being tribal together. They might yet recognize that Trump vs. Biden would be a close call, whereas Haley vs. Biden would be a landslide for the former, with down-ballot consequences that might produce Republican control of Congress. Henry Olson: There's a number of people even in the Republican Party who do not want Donald Trump. And many of them will vote for him against Joe Biden reluctantly, and many will not. And that is something that the Trump campaign should consider, but knowing the personality of the candidate, probably won't consider. Nate Silver: She's demonstrating that the non-Trump coalition within the GOP is a little more robust than commonly assumed. ABC News: Final thought: If Biden was winning only 60 percent, people would be freaking out. The Spectator's Ben Domenach: Nikki Haley winning and Trump losing Beaufort, Richland, and Charleston is a bright red klaxon for the GOP. New York Time's Katherine Miller: In New Hampshire and in polling of South Carolina and some other states, Ms. Haley is performing about commensurate with how Pat Buchanan did in 1992 against George H.W. Bush — which as my colleague Jamelle Bouie noted last month, many people treated like an embarrassing crisis for Mr. Bush at the time. That also previewed future problems in the general election. Fox News' Marc Thiessen: So if you think about this, this is a unique election in the sense that we have basically two incumbents. You have Joe Biden who's running for a second term and Donald Trump is running for a second term. Right. And so how did Joe Biden do in South Carolina? 96.2% percent of the vote. Donald Trump got 60% and four in 10 voters in the Republican Party said no. Even though they know that the race is pretty much over, that he's going to be the nominee, they still voted against him. That is a problem because when he says this is the most united Republican Party he's ever seen, it is not the most united Republican Party and 59% of those Haley voters say they're not voting for him. CNN's Alice Stewart: When four in 10 people in South Carolina are looking for a choice, that sends a stark message, and that's why she is continuing to stay in this race.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370219",4868,"By: Craig MaugerOnline here Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said Sunday night that Michigan had once been a ""beacon"" for Republicans before the gains fell apart after Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016. In an interview with The Detroit News, Haley said Trump, whom she's now challenging for the Republican presidential nomination, had left the Michigan GOP ""completely divided."" Republicans will continue to lose under Trump, because he talks ""about these things that split our party instead of bringing our party together,"" Haley said. Her comment about dividing the GOP was in response to a question about false claims from Trump and other Republicans that widespread fraud somehow caused him to lose the 2020 presidential election in Michigan to Democrat Joe Biden, who won by 3 percentage points or about 154,000 votes. ""As long as they keep saying that, Republicans will keep losing. Period,"" Haley said. With Michigan's presidential primary two days away, Haley used repeated losses by Republicans in the era of Trump's dominance over the party as her closing argument with voters. It came one day after Trump defeated Haley 60%-40% in the primary election in her home state of South Carolina. Haley rallied about 400 of her supporters in a ballroom inside the Detroit Marriott Troy on Sunday night, two days before Michigan's presidential primary election on Tuesday. Trump is the heavy favorite. But Haley has focused on there being a segment of the Republican Party that won't vote for Trump in November. He can't win a general election, Haley contended in an interview Sunday. Trump lost Michigan's 2020 presidential election to Biden by 154,000 votes or 3 percentage, 48%-51%. ""He wants to have the Republican Party be his own playpen,"" Haley told The News of Trump. ""You can't have a playpen where you use campaign contributions to pay your personal court cases. You can't have a playpen where you go and you criticize your opponents' supporters."" ""That's not the way you win a presidential election,"" she said. ""It's not the way we win elections up and down the ticket."" The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Amid Trump's criminal and civil legal troubles, the former president's Save America political action committee spent at least $54 million in 2023 for legal expenditures, amounting to 84% of the PAC's spending, The Associated Press reported Feb. 2. 'It all fell apart' Haley said she visited Michigan after state GOP lawmakers and then-Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, approved a right-to-work policy in 2012 that barred businesses and unions from reaching agreements that required workers to pay union dues or fees as a condition of their employment. ""You just saw all of these wins that were happening in Michigan,"" Haley said. ""It all fell apart since Donald Trump became president,"" she added. Republicans have suffered a string of election losses in Michigan since Trump won the 2016 presidential contest. Michigan Democrats have won two gubernatorial races, Biden was victorious in the 2020 presidential election in the state, and Democrats took full control of the Michigan Legislature for the first time in four decades in 2022, when Republicans lost a congressional seat in conservative west Michigan for the first time since Watergate in 1974. Democrats repealed the right-to-work law last year, among other major legislative victories that reversed policies passed under Snyder and legislative Republicans. Victor DiRita of East Lansing was in the crowd for Haley's event Sunday night and said he plans to cast a ballot for her Tuesday. ""She's very moderate,"" DiRita said. ""She's got good ideas. I think she's got the right priorities."" Former Rochester Hills Clerk Tina Barton was also in attendance. She labeled Haley a consistent conservative. Barton said she was tired of the ""chaos"" that's marked recent presidential administrations. ""I think it's time for a new age of leadership,"" Barton said. Haley, 52, was South Carolina's governor before serving as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations. Her crowd on Sunday night was much smaller than the one Trump drew to his rally in a Waterford Township airport hangar on Feb. 17. However, Haley said a majority of Americans simply dislike Trump. ""Do we really want to have a country in disarray and a world on fire and have our two candidates be in their 80s?"" Haley asked of Biden and Trump. Trump is 77. Biden is 81. In her 30-minute Sunday speech, Haley said she disagreed with Trump's ""isolationist"" approach to foreign affairs. ""America can never be so arrogant to think that we don't need friends,"" she said. Her biggest applause line came toward the end of her address when she talked about her time as the governor of South Carolina from 2011 to 2017. ""The tone at the top matters,"" Haley concluded as people in the crowd cheered.","","",""

The endorsement came as Haley addressed more than 1,500 people at a rally in Bloomington on Monday night. ""Senator Boschwitz embodies the American dream. He fled the Nazi regime, started a successful family business, and served our country as a soldier, a senator, and an ambassador,"" said Haley.

At home, she called for getting America's fiscal house in order to tame inflation. Abroad, Haley backed a strong foreign policy with support for our allies as the best way to keep America safe and prevent war. Finally, she warned that Republicans can't save America if they can't win a general election, and Donald Trump can't win.   Haley on Trump abandoning fiscal responsibility… ""Under his watch we went eight of our $34 trillion in debt in four years under him, more than any other president. He said nothing about fiscal responsibility, he said nothing about cutting spending, he said nothing about reducing the size of government. He's taken that completely off the table, and we see Republicans and Democrats wasting money."" Haley on Trump's flirtation with isolationism… ""We've always believed in peace through strength and for the first time we see him retreating from our ally Ukraine and going into the hands of Putin. And look, America should never be so arrogant to think we don't need friends. After 9-11 we needed a lot of friends and to have this retreat and say that we're just going to sit in our bubble that's a way that's going to get America more into war. Putin's made it very clear: Once he's done with Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics are next. That's a big deal."" Haley on Trump's GOP Titanic… ""Look at what's happening to the party. The RNC now, before the primary is over, he's going in, he's booted out the chair, he's putting in his daughter-in-law, he's putting in his campaign chair as an operative. But more than that, he's pushing to have the RNC be just about him. So it's not going to be about the House and Senate anymore, and it's all turning into his legal slush fund. That is not what we're supposed to see in our Republican Party. This is a ship that has a hole in it. It is going to sink. We are going to lose in November and go towards the socialist path if we don't right the ship and that's really what I'm trying to get out to Republicans and Americans."" Haley on Trump's Michigan losses… ""I'm in Michigan now. In 2012, they were a beacon. They were winning everything. They had just passed right to work. They were doing great things. Now you look, since 2016, when Trump came in, they've lost the governor's mansion, they've lost the State House, they've lost the State Senate. They now have a divided Republican Party, two different factions, that's happening all over the country. We've got a Republican Party split and that comes when you've got a candidate who says that his opponent's supporters are barred permanently from MAGA. And you make it about this label and you don't make it about bringing more people into the party. That is an equation to lose a general election. This is supposed to be a big tent where we want more people to come in. He is pushing people out of our party."" Haley on a third-party run… ""I'm a Republican. I have not talked to any other organization. I have not put a second of thought into an independent run because I'm a Republican. That's what I've always been. I've been a conservative Republican my whole life. I'm not going to switch over and have a Democrat vice president. That's not something I would do.

In an interview with NBC's The Today Show, she criticized Donald Trump for siding with a brutal thug and Joe Biden for failing to explain to the American people why supporting Ukraine matters. Watch the full video here:  Haley on Donald Trump's obsession with Vladimir Putin… ""It wasn't that he refused to condemn, he went further than that. In South Carolina, he gave a speech, and he said he would actually encourage Putin to invade our allies. Think about that – that means he's siding with a dictator who kills his political opponents. He's siding with a tyrant who arrests American journalists and holds them hostage. He's siding with a thug who's made no bones about the fact that he wants to destroy America. ""And here you have Ukraine, the fact that half a million people have died or been wounded because Putin invaded Ukraine, this is the time that America needs to understand that Putin has made it very clear that once he takes Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics are next. If that happens, that puts America at war. We are trying to prevent war. And when Trump went and said that he wanted Putin to invade our allies? That immediately made our allies vulnerable. It emboldened Putin, which is why he's now putting troops around the Baltic countries, and it puts all of our military men and women in those areas at risk."" Haley on Washington's lies to the American people…  ""There should be a vote for aid on Ukraine. We should give them the equipment and ammunition they need to win. But you should also acknowledge where the fault lies. Yes, it lies in the fact that Trump is retreating and getting weak in the knees when it comes to Putin, but it should also fall on the fact that Biden needs to tell the American people why they need to care about Ukraine. There has been a lack of communication from the President … ""Joe Biden needs to explain to people why Ukraine matters. The same way he needs to explain why Israel matters. The same way he needs to explain why America can never be so arrogant to think we don't need friends. Yes, they should have a vote on Ukraine; yes, they should have a vote on Israel; yes they should have a vote on the border. And they should not, in any way, lie to the American people to make them think they have to pick either Ukraine and Israel or the border.

And it's a blessing to know that across our sweet state, everyone wants to bring back the America we know and love. That's the underlying message in what happened today. I want to congratulate Donald Trump on his victory. And I want to thank the people of South Carolina for using the power of your voice. No matter the results, I love the people of our state. I love what we accomplished together. And I love how we united during our worst challenges and tragedies. I've always seen our state as a family. Families are honest with each other. They say the hard truths. That's what I've done this entire campaign. That's what I'll do now. What I saw today was South Carolina's frustration with our country's direction. I've seen that same frustration nationwide. I share it. I feel it to my core. I couldn't be more worried for America. It seems like our country is coming apart. But here's the thing. America will come apart if we make the wrong choices. This has never been about me or my political future. We need to beat Joe Biden in November. I don't believe Donald Trump can beat Joe Biden.

And I have a duty to give them that choice. We can't afford four more years of Biden's failures or Trump's lack of focus. We're at $34 trillion in debt and counting. Not even a third of our 8th graders are proficient in reading. Families can't afford groceries. Nine million illegals have come to our border—with enough fentanyl to kill every single American. And beyond our borders, the world is on fire. War is spreading further every day. If we aren't strong, those wars will draw America further in. And it's not just about policies. We won't get out of our downward spiral if we keep obsessing over the past. Does anyone seriously think Joe Biden or Donald Trump will unite our country to solve our problems? One of them calls his fellow Americans fascists. The other calls his fellow Americans vermin. They aren't fighting for our country's future. They're demanding we fight each other. The younger generation—my children's generation—knows it better than anyone. They deserve better. They deserve leadership. And so I will keep fighting—for them and for you and for all of America! From the start of this campaign, I have made clear that I'm running for president to save America. I'm running to remind us what it means to be American.

We're citizens of the greatest country in human history—and we must lead now more than ever before! I'm grateful to South Carolina. I always have been and always will be. And I'm grateful that today is not the end of our story. We're headed to Michigan tomorrow. And we're headed to the Super Tuesday states throughout all of next week. We'll keep fighting for America—and we won't rest until America wins!","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370304",3881,"CHARLESTON, S.C. — On a conference call with reporters this morning, Nikki Haley for President campaign manager Betsy Ankney announced a seven-figure ad buy across Super Tuesday states, the latest sign that Haley is moving full steam ahead. The ad buy consists of cable TV and digital platforms, and will play in Super Tuesday states as 874 delegates are up for grabs on Tuesday, March 5. Watch a recording of her call here.   Ankney echoed Haley's Tuesday comments, making it clear that the campaign will continue because voters deserve to have a real choice at the ballot box, especially when 70 percent of Americans do not want to see a Trump-Biden rematch. ""We know the odds. But we also know the stakes. And we think a whole lot of Republicans do, too. We're placing our faith in the American people. We're willing to bet that they have a lot more courage than the political class and the media who line up behind Trump even though they know what a disaster he is. And we're going to make our case until that door closes,"" Ankney said. On Nikki Haley's electability… ""And the reality is, despite whatever ALL CAPS RANTS Trump goes on about the polls, he will not defeat Joe Biden in November and he will drag the entire Republican team down with him. We know that Trump has always screamed about the polls. He has always denied reality. I think he just recently tweeted that, 'Nikki Haley is getting absolutely CLOBBERED by Crooked Joe Biden in the Polls. I am beating him by a lot, as much as 20 points.' That is completely absurd. In no world is that accurate. The latest Marquette Law School national survey shows Nikki up 18 points over Biden, 59 to 41, while Trump is within the margin of error."" On Trump's losing record… ""In 2016, Trump won the White House, and Republicans had the House and the Senate. And then, the luster wore off. While people were initially willing to give Trump a pass – it became tiring. Independents and suburban women grew sick of the name calling and the chaos and they revolted at the ballot box…In 2020, Trump lost women by 15 points. He lost Independents by 13 points. ""After losing Republicans the White House, the House, and the Senate, Trump's losing streak continued in 2022. His handpicked candidates for Senate lost in Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, and Pennsylvania. We took back the House by the skin of our teeth, but wildly underperformed expectations. 2022 was the first midterm election since 1934 in which the incumbent president's party did not lose a single state legislative chamber or incumbent senator. ""And we all just saw what happened this month when Republicans lost a special election to replace the illustrious Republican George Santos in New York."" On Trump's 2016 coalition… ""So history and the polls show that Trump cannot win. And thinking that Trump can somehow cobble together the winning coalition that propelled him to victory in 2016 against an enfeebled Joe Biden is just a pipe dream. Let's look at what he's done in just the last month. ""He has called women stupid. He has cozied up to dictators. He has encouraged Putin to invade Europe. He's disparaged members of the military. And he also has spent $58 million in campaign contributions on his personal court cases. He lost Independents in New Hampshire by 22 points. He has done and said nothing that is going to bring back the demographics that our party has lost. They know who he is and they don't like him. And they have rejected him in every single election since 2016."" On how badly Democrats want to run against Trump… ""There's a reason Biden and the Democrats want to run against Trump. They know they can beat him. Again. If Trump is the nominee, the House is gone. If Trump is the nominee, the Senate map automatically shrinks from 8 or 9 targets to 3 – and keep in mind this is the best Senate map Republicans have for the rest of the decade.""","","",""

Trump spent more on legal fees ($831,879.35) than the campaign spent on payroll ($581,334.82) Of the $7.4 million MAGA Inc. raised in January, $5 million came from Timothy Mellon, a banking heir and businessman who has given a total of $15 million to the super PAC and also donated $15 million to the super PAC supporting RFK Jr. Lara Trump doubled down on her promise to spend ""every single penny"" of Republican National Committee funds on Trump's presidential campaign-and unbelievably said paying Trump's legal bills were of ""big interest"" to Republican voters and said the RNC should be paying those bills, perhaps forgetting it is the RNC's job to help all Republicans up and down the ballot. ""Donald Trump only cares about one person—himself,"" said Haley national spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. ""He has turned his presidential campaign into a legal defense slush fund and will not have the resources or focus to go up against Joe Biden and the Democrats. He's convinced seniors to take $5 out of their Social Security checks, persuading them it is going to help elect him but is really going to pay for high-priced show lawyers. No matter what you think about Donald Trump, this is a losing strategy for November.""","","",""

But the latest Marquette Law School Poll national survey has some absolutely eye-popping numbers in a hypothetical match-up between President Biden and Nikki Haley, currently a distant second in the GOP presidential primary. A new Marquette Law School Poll national survey finds former President Donald Trump is the choice of 51 percent of registered voters and President Joe Biden is the choice of 49 percent. Among likely voters, Trump receives 52 percent and Biden 48 percent. These results include voters who initially said they would vote for someone else or would not vote but were then asked their preference if they had to choose one of the two candidates. In the initial question, 13 percent said ""someone else"" or that they would not vote. Trump received initial support from 45 percent, and Biden was the initial choice of 42 percent. The survey was conducted Feb. 5-15, 2024, interviewing 882 registered voters nationwide, with a margin of error of +/-4.5 percentage points. For likely voters, the sample size is 706, with a margin of error of +/-5 percentage points.  . . . Nikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and former governor of South Carolina, holds a larger lead over Biden than does Trump, with 58 percent of registered voters supporting her and 42 percent supporting Biden. Fifty-eight percent to 42 percent? A 16-point lead? Are you kidding me? If the popular-vote margin were even half that, Haley would not only win most or all of the big swing states, she would probably either win or be close in a bunch of states where Republicans haven't been close in many cycles — Virginia, Colorado, New Jersey, New Mexico . . . Numbers like this suggest that the general electorate is exhausted with Biden and begging the Republicans for some normal, non-crazy, non-geriatric, non-Trump option. But hey, so far, it appears most Republicans aren't interested in a candidate who's a generation younger than Biden and who doesn't scare off suburban soccer moms. Nope, the GOP always has to do things the hard way.","","",""

Some of you—perhaps a few of you in the media—came here today to see if I'm dropping out of the race. Well, I'm not. Far from it. And I'm here to tell you why. I'm running for president because we have a country to save. Since the start of my campaign, I've been focused on the real issues our country faces. The ones that determine whether America will thrive… or spiral out. I'm talking about the millions of students who don't know how to read or do basic math. The families who can't afford groceries, much less a first home. The total lawlessness on our southern border. I'm talking about the murders in our cities, the fentanyl on our streets, the children who've been killed in their mom's car by stray bullets. And I'm talking about the American weakness that led to wars in Europe and the Middle East—and the urgent need to restore our strength, before war spreads and draws America further in. These are the challenges I'm here to tackle. But instead of focusing on how to make America stronger tomorrow, some people want to know if I'm going to cave today. We've all heard the calls for me to drop out. We all know where they're coming from. The political elite. The party bosses. Their cheerleaders in the commentator world. The argument is familiar. They say I haven't won a state. That my path to victory is slim. They point to the primary polls and say I'm only delaying the inevitable. Why keep fighting when the battle was apparently over after Iowa? Look, I get it. In politics, the herd mentality is enormously strong. A lot of Republican politicians have surrendered to it. The pressure on them was too much. They didn't want to be left out of the club. Of course, many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump privately dread him. They know what a disaster he's been and will continue to be for our party. They're just too afraid to say it out loud. Well, I'm not afraid to say the hard truths out loud. I feel no need to kiss the ring. And I have no fear of Trump's retribution. I'm not looking for anything from him. My own political future is of zero concern. So, I hear what the political class says. But I hear from the American people too. I've heard from a retired army medic who looked evil in the eye. When he says we're heading toward disaster—that American lives are on the line—he knows what he's talking about. He knows we can't afford more of the same. That's why he told me to ""give 'em hell."" I've heard from a mom who promised to email me every day and does. She just wants a ""return to normalcy."" She wants me to keep running for the sake of her 4-year-old son. She hopes he'll see the ""America she grew up in""—an America that's strong and proud and united in purpose. And I've heard from a high-school student, who just last week came to hear me speak. She asked me to sign a note to her teacher explaining her absence. After growing up amid the chaos and anger of the last few years, she finally has hope that America will make it… if we make the right choice. I'm constantly hearing from Americans like these—hundreds a day, thousands a week, and hundreds of thousands since I declared my candidacy. They see the same polls as me. But more importantly, they have the same belief as me. They believe in America. They believe America can do so much better—that we must do better. And they know when the country's future is on the line, you don't drop out. You keep fighting. In fact, you fight harder than ever. That's why I refuse to quit. South Carolina will vote on Saturday. But on Sunday, I'll still be running for president. I'm not going anywhere. I'm campaigning every day, until the last person votes, because I believe in a better America and a brighter future for our kids. Nothing good in life comes easy. I'm willing to take the cuts, the bruises, and the name calling. Because the only way you get to the blessing is by going through the pain. Dropping out would be the easy route. I've never taken the easy route. I've been the underdog in every race I've ever run. I've always been David taking on Goliath. And like David, I'm not just fighting someone bigger than me. I'm fighting for something bigger than myself. I'm used to people questioning my intentions, so I'll make a few things clear. Some people used to say I was running because I really wanted to be Vice President. I think I've pretty well settled that question. Other people say I'm trying to set up a future presidential run. How does that even work? If I was running for a bogus reason, I would have dropped out a long time ago. The rest of the fellas already did that. They have their own plans. I don't judge them. But I'm still here. I'm fighting for what I know is right. And I don't care what the party leaders and political elites want. I'll keep fighting until the American people close the door. That day is not today. And it won't be Saturday. Not by a long shot. The presidential primaries have barely begun. Just three states have voted. Three. That's it. After this weekend, we'll be at four. That's not a lot. In the 10 days after South Carolina, another 21 states and territories will vote. People have a right to have their voices heard. And they deserve a real choice, not a Soviet-style election where there's only one candidate and he gets 99% of the vote. We don't anoint kings in this country. We have elections. And Donald Trump, of all people, should know we don't rig elections! Americans of every belief and background are tired of our national mess. They don't want more chaos and craziness. They worry about a national collapse. If I weren't in the race, we'd be reading the exact same story every day until November 5. There would be widespread reports of Americans suffering from a bad case of ""Biden-Trump fatigue."" And it would be true. A stunning 70% of the country doesn't want a Biden-Trump rematch. The majority of Americans don't just dislike one candidate. They dislike both. As a country, we've never seen such dissatisfaction with the leading candidates. We've never had so many Americans mired in pessimism and division. We still have a chance to restore their faith. I will fight as long as that chance exists. Now, I know what Donald Trump is saying. He wants an election with no opponent. But that's not what voters are saying. Despite being a de facto incumbent, Donald Trump lost 49% of the vote in Iowa. In New Hampshire, Trump lost 46% of the vote. That's not good. We're talking about almost half our voters. What does it say about an incumbent who is losing nearly half his party? It spells disaster in November. We shouldn't silence these voters, like Trump wants. They have the right to keep speaking out. Trump sees this. That's why he and his allies are now trying a different tack. They're saying I'm helping Joe Biden by staying in. Let's unpack that for a second. First thing's first: Joe Biden is doing more damage to himself than any Republican could ever do. Every time he opens his mouth, he sounds like his mind is closing up shop. The Democrats are getting weaker by holding a coronation for Biden. Republicans will get stronger through a vigorous competition. We have plenty of time to hash this out. If the race ended today, we'd have the longest general election in history. There are still eight and a half months before Election Day. Do we really want to spend every day from now until November watching America's two most disliked politicians duke it out? No sane person wants that. But there's another reason Trump is wrong. At the end of the day, the only candidate who's helping Joe Biden is Donald Trump, because Trump is the only Republican Biden can beat. The Democrats know it. They don't even try to conceal their glee at the prospect of running against Trump. They want to win—so they want the guy they've already beaten time and again. Trump knows it too, but he won't admit it. True to form, he's taking out his anger on others. He's getting meaner and more offensive by the day. He's trying to bully me and anyone who supports me. He says they'll be barred from MAGA—permanently. That's not the way you win elections. Well, I've dealt with bullies my entire life. They don't intimidate me. They only motivate me further. And I've never met a bully I couldn't take on. There are also those who try to paint me as, quote, ""Never Trump."" That's not who I am. Never have been. I supported Trump in 2016 and 2020. I was proud to serve America in his Cabinet. My purpose has never been to stop Trump at all costs. Like most Americans, I have a handful of serious concerns about the former President. But I have countless serious concerns about the current president. Joe Biden has turned our country upside down. It's not normal for millions of migrants to illegally cross our border without being stopped. It's not normal for our schools to be more focused on gender pronouns than reading and math. It's not normal to have skyrocketing prices and soaring crime. And it's not normal to have wars raging in Europe and the Middle East. All of that is on Joe Biden. But he's not the only one who's replaced normalcy with chaos. Donald Trump has done that, too. It's not normal to insult our military heroes and veterans. It's not normal to spend fifty million dollars in campaign donations on personal court cases. It's not normal to threaten the people who back your opponent. And it's not normal to call on Russia to invade NATO countries. Donald Trump has done all that and more in just the last month. Look, I've said it many times -- I think Donald Trump was the right president at the right time. But times change—and so has Trump. He's gotten more unstable and unhinged. He spends more time in courtrooms than on the campaign trail. He refuses to debate. He's completely distracted. And everything is about him. He's so obsessed with his own demons from the past, he can't focus on delivering the future Americans deserve. We have two hugely flawed candidates in Biden and Trump. Americans know it. They've been saying it for years. And we all know why. Trump and Biden are two old men who are only getting older. Nearly 60% of Americans say Trump and Biden are both too old to be president—because they are. We've all seen them fumble their words and get confused about world leaders. That's not who you want in the Oval Office when Russia launches a nuclear weapon at our satellites or China shuts down our electricity grid. We're talking about the most demanding job in human history. You don't give it to someone who's at risk of dementia. You give it to someone who is disciplined—someone who can work day and night for eight years straight. No vendettas. No drama. Just results. Even if Trump and Biden weren't too old—and again, they are—Americans still oppose them because we know what they'll do. They've already done tremendous damage—and they're just getting started. Biden has crippled families with years of inflation. He's put welfare over work and doled out more corporate welfare than any president, ever. Meanwhile, Trump added more to the national debt than any president in history. And it wasn't because of COVID, no matter how many times he tries that excuse. Now he wants a 10% tax hike on every American. Just like Biden, Trump will devastate families and destroy good-paying jobs. We need to shift our economy into overdrive—not reverse. Most importantly, we need a President who protects America. Biden has failed this basic duty. As Commander-in-Chief, he tried to cut the military. He's made us weaker while our enemies get stronger. He withdrew from Afghanistan in a way that encouraged our enemies to do whatever they want. Three years later, Russia has invaded Ukraine. Hamas has murdered Israeli women and children in their beds. China is launching unprecedented cyberattacks on American infrastructure. Iran is killing American soldiers. At the same time, Donald Trump has plenty of his own problems on national security. He's all but said he'll abandon Ukraine. That's a massive gift to Vladimir Putin. Now Trump is inviting Putin to invade NATO countries. Those are the same countries that stood with us after September 11th. Of course we should demand they pay more. But abandoning them will only bring more war. Putin is already planning his next move. He's eyeing our allies in the Baltics. A Russian attack would put America at war. Russia isn't the only country that smells blood in the water. When the dictators in Iran, North Korea, and Communist China see America step back, they rush into the breach. They think America's time has passed—and their time has come. The truth is, Americans already know what Joe Biden and Donald Trump will do. But we're just as concerned with who they are. They're dividers at a time when America desperately, urgently, needs a uniter. All they do is turn us against each other. Trump calls his fellow Americans vermin. Biden calls his fellow Americans fascists. Trump and Biden don't just demand that people pick sides. They demand that their followers hate the other side. Look where that's gotten us. Congress is too divided and broken to do its job. Families won't even talk to each other at the dinner table. We're separating into opposing camps that view each other as un-American, if not downright evil. These are dangerous times. The most important thing we must do is regain our focus and shared sense of purpose. The worst thing we can do is become even more distracted and divided. The reason I'm running—the reason I continue to run—is to remind everyone what it means to be American. I'm the proud daughter of legal immigrants. I grew up as a brown girl in a black-and-white world. I saw our state move beyond hatred and elect the first female minority governor in American history—as a conservative Republican. And in just a few days, my parents are going to cast their vote for their daughter for President of the United States. I've thought this week about what that means to them. But I know what it says about our country. In the America I know and love, we disagree strongly, but we do it without hating each other, and we still have a shared national purpose. In the America I know and love, we respect freedom and the rule of law, we refuse to use the awesome power of big government to punish those we dislike, and we recognize that America has done more good for more people than any country in the world. It's not America First to withdraw from the world. It's not America First to praise dictators who want to kill Americans. It's not America First to bankrupt Social Security by doing nothing to fix it. And in fact, it's America Last to keep losing one election after another to the Socialist Left. That's what we get with Donald Trump. I'm running for president to restore a country that's strong and proud. That is why I will stay in the race after South Carolina votes. And to my beloved fellow South Carolinians, I ask that you stand with me. Stand with your family, friends, and neighbors. See the America I see. And remember that we can still unite and move forward together—not with anger and fear, but with faith and hope, like we've done before. Let's finally leave the past behind—and let's forge a new American future. This vision has guided every generation. It summoned me to serve as governor of this great state, and as ambassador for the greatest country in the world. And that same vision called my husband to serve in the uniform of the United States. He's a major in the South Carolina Army National Guard. As I prepare for what lies ahead, Michael is at the front of my mind. I wish Michael was here today, and I wish our children and I could see him tonight. But we can't. He's serving on the other side of the world, where conflict is the norm. Where terrorists hide among the innocent. Where Iran's terrorist proxies are now attacking American troops. This is Michael's second deployment. It was hard for us to say goodbye the first time, when he deployed to Afghanistan. It was even harder last summer when he deployed to Africa. As every military family knows, when a loved one deploys, it's a year-long prayer. It's a prayer for their safety, more than anything else. But it's also a prayer of gratitude. The kids and I know why Michael went. He stepped up to keep us safe—and not just us. He stepped up to defend our nation's freedom and our way of life. Michael is fighting for the country he loves. So are all his brothers-and-sisters-in-arms, wherever they're stationed in our dangerous world. They have made their stand because America is worth fighting and even dying for. Now I will continue to make my stand because America is worth living for. Thank you. God bless you, God bless South Carolina, and God bless America.","","",""

Imagine if he promised to make life even harder for the middle class and the least fortunate. That candidate would ? and should ?be laughed off the stage and defeated at the ballot box.

The centerpiece of his economic plan is a 10% tariff on every imported good that comes into our country. A tariff is a tax, plain and simple, and a 10% tariff means adding 10% to the price of every covered item. Just like a tax hike on every American, a new tariff on every import would crush the middle class and further impoverish struggling families. Americans still haven't recovered from high inflation rates Is there a worse policy at a worse time? Americans are still trying to dig out from more than three years of high inflation under President Joe Biden. We've been hammered by higher prices on everything. It feels like families can't go out to eat without paying more than $100. They can't go to the grocery store without feeling like they've cleaned out their savings. Going to the movies feels like making a down payment on a house, and actual down payments have soared, too. It's so hard to make ends meet, Americans just hit another record of $1.13 trillion in credit card debt. That's up $50 billion in just three months. Americans need help, and they need it now. But one of Trump's first acts in office would be to double down on the pain. Inflation under President Biden has already cost the typical family at least $11,400 a year, according to an analysis from Republican members of the U.S. Senate Joint Economic Committee, raising prices by an average of 5.7% a year. That's the third highest rate of any president since at least the Eisenhower administration. Trump's 10% tariffs would cost the average household an additional $2,600 in a year, if not more. It took Biden years to do so much damage. Trump would take an ax to family budgets overnight. Americans would have no escape. Huge amounts of our food come from overseas, so prices would soar at the grocery store. The price of clothes, strollers and appliances would skyrocket, too. Birthday presents and Christmas gifts? Even more expensive. You thought pharmaceuticals and cars were expensive under Biden? Just wait until Trump slaps them with a tariff tax. Trump's tariff could even force the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates again as inflation reignited. Our economy would slip backward at the exact moment we should be moving forward. Trump's tariff would hurt lower-income Americans the most And the pain wouldn't be spread out equally because tariffs aren't just any tax. They get more and more painful for those who make less money. A millionaire doesn't care how much he pays for his fridge. A single mom trying to make ends meet while feeding her kids needs that fridge to be as affordable as possible. That single mom needs a job, too. While Trump thinks his 10% tariff would save jobs and kickstart a manufacturing renaissance, in fact, it would destroy a stunning 505,000 American jobs, according to a Tax Foundation analysis. Main Street would suffer, with small businesses laying off workers to try to pay for higher costs. And you know what industry may get hit the hardest? Manufacturing. American factories depend on affordable imports to keep prices low. If they're forced to pay more, they won't just pass on the costs to working families via higher prices. They'll also struggle to compete with the rest of the world. In the name of helping American factories, Trump would strengthen foreign enemies. Americans are desperate for relief. They want smart solutions, not more price hikes and problems created by one-size-fits-all mandates. We need bigger paychecks and better jobs for working families, not bigger bills and a repeat of Biden's failures. That's why we should cut taxes on working families, not raise them, and give the government less control over the economy, not more. Ultimately, we should lift up the middle class instead of pushing them even further down. Americans would never vote for a president who promised to raise their taxes and cripple our economy. We shouldn't start now, whether it's Joe Biden or Donald Trump.","","",""

Haley on Trump's weakness on Russia… ""It's amazing to me how weak in the knees he is when it comes to Putin, because you look at the fact he has yet to say anything about Navalny's death, which Putin murdered him. It's what he does to his political opponents. He's yet to say anything about seizing Russian assets and allowing that money to go to Ukraine, why would you not want to have those assets seized? It's sitting in Congress, he should be calling for that. He doesn't talk about anything. All he does is go on late-night rants talking about his court cases."" Haley on Trump's distractions and legal soap opera… ""We're seeing all of these things happen and Trump's doing late-night rants about his court cases. He's going to be in court for the rest of the year. We can't be distracted. But more of that, that's why I continue to say if Donald Trump is the nominee, he can't win. He won't win a general election. And the focus we need to have is how do we protect Americans? How do we prevent war? How do we get the border secure? How do we get our economy back on track? Not his personal grievances."" Haley on what's at stake… ""Yes, there will be a female president of the United States. It will either be me or it will be Kamala Harris. But look at any of the general election polls. Trump doesn't beat Biden. But more than that, all he does is bring chaos. Look, I voted for him twice. I was proud to serve America in his administration, but this is the fact we can't have two 80-year-old candidates being our only choices. Seventy percent of Americans have said they don't want a Trump Biden rematch. Fifty-nine percent of Americans have said Trump's too old and Biden's too old to be president. Let's put in someone that can spend eight years. Discipline no drama. No vendettas. No chaos. and let's get some real things done for our children, our grandchildren, and future generations.""","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370320",3947,"COLUMBIA, S.C. – This morning Nikki Haley joined Jonathan Karl on ABC's This Week to discuss Trump's failure to call out Putin on Navalny's death, Trump's antipathy toward NATO, and his attempted takeover of the Republican National Committee to pay his legal fees.   On Trump's failure to call out Putin on Navalny's death… ""This goes back to the fact we need to remind the American people that Vladimir Putin is not our friend. Vladimir Putin is not cool. This is not someone we want to associate with. This is not someone that we want to be friends with. This is not someone that we can trust. And so when you hear Donald Trump say in South Carolina a week ago that he would encourage Putin to invade our allies if they weren't pulling their weight, that's bone chilling because all he did in that one moment was empower Putin. And all he did in that moment was he sided with a guy that kills his political opponents, he sided with a thug that arrests American journalists and holds them hostage. And he sided with a guy who wanted to make a point to the Russian people, don't challenge me in the next election or this will happen to you too… It's actually pretty amazing that he, not only after making those comments, that he would encourage Putin to invade NATO, but the fact that he won't acknowledge anything with Navalny either he sides with Putin and thinks it's cool that Putin killed one of his political opponents or he just doesn't think it's that big of a deal. Either one of those is concerning. Either one of those is a problem."" Haley on Trump's antipathy toward NATO… ""I'm worried about a lot of things if Trump is re-elected. That is one of them. You know, first of all, understand that NATO is a 75-year success story. This alliance, keep in mind Russia has never invaded a NATO country because Russia has typically been very intimidated by this alliance. China is even intimidated by this alliance. So keeping NATO strong is important. Adding more friends to the fold is important. This is not the time to leave an alliance. This is not the time to side with a thug and not side with our friends who stood with us after 9/11. We have to make sure that we stand firm because when we stand firm with our friends, our enemies stay on their heels. When we start to show any weakening of those alliances, that's when our enemies move. That's why we're seeing China on the march. That's why we're seeing Iran want to build a nuclear bomb. That's why we're seeing Russia start to move towards Poland and the Baltics. It is not something to play with when you talk about NATO. This is something where we should be doubling down and saying that this alliance will only get stronger. And that's what I'll promise I do as president, is we not only will strengthen NATO, we will strengthen alliances with India, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines. We will add to the fold. This is about America having more friends, not less friends."" Haley on the RNC being Trump's ""piggy bank""... ""It should be a wake up call for Republicans all over this country. I mean you look at the fact that we saw in his campaign reports that he used $50 million of campaign contributions to pay for his personal court cases. Then he tried to get the RNC to name him the presumptive nominee. We don't anoint kings in America. So when he got pushback on that they started to walk it back. Now he's trying to control the RNC by putting his daughter-in-law as the co-chair and putting his campaign manager as the director of operations. Now when you look at that, the part I worry about is the RNC is now going to be the piggy bank for Trump's legal fees. The RNC is almost broke already. Now you go and see he's looking for other avenues to pay his legal fees. The RNC, you can hang up winning the House and the Senate or having any resources for us to win any other races if all they're doing is thinking about how they're going to pay his court fees.""","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370309",5668,"COLUMBIA, S.C.— During a town hall with Fox News' John Roberts, Nikki Haley criticized Donald Trump for siding with Vladimir Putin, failing to ban TikTok, and refusing to lift a finger to save Social Security for future generations. Finally, Haley rejected the toxicity from both parties and called for uniting Americans and bringing out the best in people. Haley on Russia…   ""We have to remember Russia is not our friend. If Putin's mouth is open he is lying, and we need to be aware of that. And I think that's why it was so damaging when Trump said that he would choose Putin and actually encourage Putin to invade NATO allies instead of standing with our allies that stood with us at 9-11. Putin knows exactly what he did with Navalny. You look at that situation, this is what he always does. He murders his political opponents, he arrests American journalists and holds them hostage, and he has made no bones about the fact that he wants to destroy America. And so the best thing we can do with Russia is let them know we're on to them and make sure that they know we'll hold them to account on anything they do, and that includes hurting our allies."" … ""I will absolutely put the hammer on our NATO countries that they do have to carry their weight. But you do that behind closed doors. You do that and let them know that the United States is not going to carry the burden. But you don't do it in the eyes of our enemies. Right now, NATO has been a 75-year success story…. We should make sure we tell our partners it's in their best interest and in the Alliance's best interest to pull their own weight and we should make them do that. But there's a way to do it the right way and there's a way to do it the wrong way, and the way Trump did it by saying he was going to encourage Putin to invade our allies—that's the wrong way and it makes the situation much more dangerous."" Haley on banning TikTok…   President Trump said he would ban TikTok and then when President Xi asked him not to, that fell to the wayside. We should have banned it from the very beginning. It's incredibly dangerous and even if it is helpful in elections. I think that the tone at the top and the leadership of what you show matters. If I were to go and jump on TikTok or Republicans were to jump on TikTok, that's not showing anyone why they shouldn't be on it. What everybody needs to know is China is controlling all of that. And if you want to know how it affects you. Just imagine by having that app on your phone, China can now see your finances. They can now see who your contacts are. They can see what you click on, why you click on it, and how it affects you. They can impact what you see, and they can impact what you hear. That is the dangerous part of TikTok."" Haley on protecting Social Security….   ""Once again, Trump is lying about my record. And I will say this, if you have to lie to win, you don't deserve to win… We also have to acknowledge some hard truths. Social Security will go bankrupt in 10 years. Medicare will go bankrupt in eight. Putting our head in the sand is not going to fix that problem. Donald Trump has said he's not going to touch it. Joe Biden said he's not going to touch it. You know what that does? When they leave office, that's a 24% cut for everybody and their benefits. That is unacceptable. ""The accountant in me says you get in front of an issue. So the first thing we need to do is tell everybody, if you are invested in the system, if you are looking to get something, we're not touching you. America should keep her promises. And we're going to keep that promise to you. But the way we deal with those is we go to those like my kids in their twenties, and we tell them that coming into the system, we're going to have to change the rules for them. We'll have to change the retirement age to reflect life expectancy for them. Instead of cost of living increases, we'll do increases based on inflation. We'll cap the benefits on the mega wealthy, and we'll expand Medicare Advantage plans, which seniors love, that create more competition. Once we do that, not only can we make sure that you have what you're expecting, but we can also make sure our kids have something so that when their time comes, they've got something there for them."" Haley on unifying our country…   ""This is not normal to have this much chaos around us. It is not normal to have this much anger around us. It's not normal to have this much division around us. You should be able to have dinner with your family without an argument. You should be able to go to work and say what you want without feeling like you're going to be hurting your job for it. We need to bring civility back, and you can be tough and strong without being hateful. ""And we did that in South Carolina when we were brought to our knees because nine amazing souls were murdered in a church and every other city was going up in flames. What did we do? We didn't go and have everything burn down. We didn't have riots, we had vigils. We didn't have protests, we had prayer. And we came together as South Carolinians, and we said that we're better than this. The difference with the tone at the top, in that situation where our state could have fallen apart, my job wasn't to judge either side. My job wasn't to decide who was good and who was bad, who was right and who was wrong. My job as a leader was to pull out the best in people and get them to see the way forward. That's what we need in a president, is someone who's not gonna divide people, but pull out the best in people so that they want to be patriotic, they want to love America, and they want to take care of each other again.""","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370272",2803,"By: Tara SuterOnline here GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley pressed former President Trump to call out Russian President Vladimir Putin in the wake of opposition leader Alexei Navalny's death, while arguing that his silence is ""a problem."" ""Anybody that can't call out a dictator, that's a problem,"" Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, said in the interview on CNN's ""The Source"" with anchor Kaitlan Collins. ""You know, he should be calling – not just calling Putin out for what happened to Nalvany, he should be calling Putin out for the fact that he's got Evan Gershkovich as a hostage,"" she continued, referring to The Wall Street Journal reporter who has been detained in Russia for nearly a year. ""He should be calling out Putin for invading Ukraine."" Her comments come after Navalny, 47, was found unresponsive by the Russian Federal Prison Service. He had been serving a 19-year sentence on charges of extremism in one of Russia's highest-security prisons in a remote area known for severe winters. The opposition leader, who grew from a blogger to Putin's chief rival, is just the latest of the Russian president's critics to be found dead — which has sparked international concerns about whether the Kremlin was involved. Haley, like many others, have accused Putin of orchestrating Navalny's death. ""Putin did this,"" she wrote Friday morning on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, in response to the news. ""The same Putin who Donald Trump praises and defends. The same Trump who said: 'In all fairness to Putin, you're saying he killed people. I haven't seen that'."" She echoed those claims Saturday, arguing Trump's praise of Putin has only ""emboldened"" him, including aggressive comments the former president has made about NATO. His harsh criticism of the treaty alliance centers on efforts to get NATO members to commit 2 percent of their GDP to defense spending — or else, he vowed to rescind protection and signaled he would ""encourage"" Russia to attack them. ""That means Donald Trump is siding with a thug who kills his political opponents,"" Haley said. ""He's siding with someone who has made no bones about wanting to destroy America. He's siding with someone who arrests American journalists and holds them hostage."" Navalny's death was confirmed by his family Saturday, who said he was murdered, and they have pushed Russia to return his body. President Biden also blamed Putin for his death Friday. ""Make no mistake: Putin is responsible for Navalny's death. Putin is responsible,"" he said from the White House. ""What has happened to Navalny is yet more proof of Putin's brutality. No one should be fooled."" The president had previously given a warning to Putin in a 2021 meeting in Geneva that there would be ""devastating"" consequences if Navalny were to die.","","",""

The RNC has previously spent more than $2 million on Trump's legal drama in 2021 and 2022.

That chaos will lead to Republican losses from the White House all the way down the ballot.   Haley: RNC shouldn't be Trump's 'piggy bank' By: Olivia AlafrizOnline here Nikki Haley said she is less concerned about Donald Trump's legal troubles than how the former president planned to pay the crushing penalties for his actions. ""My biggest issue is I don't want the RNC to become his legal defense fund. I don't want the RNC to become his piggy bank for his personal court cases. We've already seen him spend $50 million worth of campaign contributions toward his personal court cases,"" Haley told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Friday. ""Now we see him trying to get control of the RNC, so he can continue not to have to pay his own legal fees,"" Haley continued. The judge overseeing Trump's civil fraud trial issued a $354.8 million verdict Friday, finding that Trump had orchestrated massive business fraud by falsely inflating his net worth to obtain favorable rates from banks and insurers. That verdict, along with interest and his other civil judgments, means he is on the hook for over $500 million. Several senior Republican officials have expressed concern that Trump's expected takeover of the RNC will ultimately pave the way for the committee to once again cover his legal bills. This past week, Trump endorsed Michael Whatley, the head of the North Carolina state GOP, to be the RNC's next chair. He also endorsed his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, to serve as co-chair and Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to his campaign, to serve as the RNC's chief operating officer. RNC members must approve the chair and co-chair positions, though with Trump's endorsements, the election will likely be a formality. The RNC previously spent nearly $2 million on two legal firms working on Trump cases in 2021 and 2022, but stopped once Trump jumped into the presidential campaign.","","",""

She has only continued to ratchet up the criticism of him as they head into a primary showdown in her home state on Feb. 24. Mr. Trump has not yet commented publicly on Mr. Navalny's death. On Friday, soon after the news of Ms. Navalny's death broke, Ms. Haley went further than most Republicans in attacking Mr. Trump for his past remarks in praise of Mr. Putin. At her rallies since, she has underscored Mr. Trump's cozy relationship with the Russian leader and sought to sound the alarm over his suggestions that he would encourage Russian aggression against U.S. allies in Europe. On Saturday, she also addressed the news that Russia was developing a nuclear space weapon with the potential to destroy satellites, calling for the prevention of war in space. Russian authorities announced on Friday that Mr. Navalny, who was serving multiple sentences in Russia, had died in a prison inside the Arctic Circle. President Biden has said that U.S. officials did not have a full understanding of the circumstances, but that he believed that ""there is no doubt that the death of Navalny was a consequence of something that Putin and his thugs did."" In the news conference on Saturday, Ms. Haley asked of Mr. Trump: ""Why does he always side with dictators?""","","",""

CHARLESTON, S.C. — Quick question: does Donald Trump believe that Vladimir Putin is responsible for the death of his chief political opponent, Alexei Navalny? Nikki Haley has been outspoken since news broke of Navalny's death in a Russian prison, immediately calling out Putin as the culprit. Trump, on the other hand, has gone more than 24 hours without uttering the names ""Navalny"" or ""Putin."" Haley took to social media earlier today to call out Trump directly for his silence:   This is a years-long pattern for Trump, who, in 2017 defended Putin, even after Fox News' Bill O'Reilly confronted him and asked how he could support a killer. Watch it here:   Trump's silence is particularly notable after his comments last week where he encouraged Putin to invade NATO countries.","","",""

A mobile billboard will travel near Trump's rally today, playing a video highlighting Trump's promise and his many, many, many losses.   Under Trump, Republicans lost nationwide in 2018, 2020, and 2022, but they also lost winnable races in Michigan.  In 2018, Republicans lost Michigan's 8th and 11th Congressional Districts—both lean Republican seats—and the governor's race.   In 2020, Trump lost Michigan, and Republicans lost the Senate race by 1.7 points.   In 2022, the Trump-endorsed Republican lost Michigan's 3rd Congressional District after he beat the incumbent Republican in the primary. They also failed to defeat the incumbent governor Gretchen Whitmer and saw Democrats take control of the State House and State Senate—giving Democrats a powerful trifecta.  ""Republicans are tired of losing, because that is all we have done for the past seven years,"" said Haley national spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. ""Trump lost in 2018, 2020, and 2022. He lost the House, Senate, and White House. He's even losing his court cases. And general election polls show he loses to or ties with Joe Biden while Nikki Haley wins big. The choice is clear: Lose with Donald Trump's endless chaos. Or win with Nikki Haley."" Since 2016, Trump has led Republicans to resounding electoral defeats year after year:  In 2017, Trump threw his support behind Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race, only to see Moore lose in ruby-red Alabama to Democrat Doug Jones.   In 2018, Democrats netted 41 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, giving Nancy Pelosi the speaker's gavel for the second time in two decades.   In 2020, Donald Trump lost his re-election bid, and Republicans lost the Senate after Trump's antics cost the GOP two Senate seats in Georgia.   In 2022, Republicans predicted a historic red wave given Biden's historically bad poll numbers. Instead, Republicans took back the House with the thinnest of margins and lost key Senate races around the country.   In 2023, Democrats kept the Kentucky governorship and voters in Ohio codified the right to abortion in the state constitution.   In 2024, Republicans' razor-thin House majority got even slimmer when the GOP lost the special election in New York's Third Congressional District.   In 2024, powerful House Republicans are dropping like flies because they know Republicans won't keep the House with Trump on the ticket.","","",""

Thank you very much, everybody. And I'm thrilled to be back in the American heartland, this is the heartland, with the proud hard-working patriots who made this country run and made the country great. Might not be so great right now, but we're gonna have it great very quickly again [cheers and applause]. Not so great right now. Thanks to citizens like you, this November, the great state of Michigan is going to tell 'Crooked' Joe Biden, you're fired, get the hell out of here [cheers and applause]. Get out of here. Worst president we've ever had. He's the worse president, the most incompetent president. But first, just 10 days from now, we're going to win a monumental victory in the Michigan Republican primary. Ten days. Ten days. And we've won 'em all by massive records. Every single state, we've won. You know that. Iowa, New Hampshire, right down the line with Nevada, we won by, we won by records. They've never had votes like that. So, something's happening, right? Something's happening. The primary is Tuesday, February 27th. But early voting is available statewide starting today, so you can do that, or you can wait a little bit. We're not worried about the primary. What we wanna do, we gotta win that– look, get a lot of votes in the primary, we wanna send a signal. But we wanna win November 5th [cheers and applause]. November 5th, we're going to get this guy out. Gonna change our country. We're going to bring our country back, bring our country back from Hell. So don't wait, get out and vote. When we win back the White House, we will have no higher priority than ending the weaponization of this horrible legal system that has developed around us. It's a horrible, horrible thing that's taking place. You talk about democracy, this is a real threat to democracy, and restoring fair, equal, and impartial justice in America, we have to have that, 'cuz we don't have that now. The decision yesterday in New York, you may have read about it– crooked Judge, crooked judge [b] he's a crooked judge– by a radical left-wing judge, was a lawless and unconstitutional atrocity that sets fire to our laws like no one has ever seen in this country before. That happens in Banana Republics, it doesn't happen in this country. The case is a complete and total sham. It's a sham case. There were no victims, no defaults, no damages, no complaints, no nothing. There was nothing. The actual bankers who were involved in the loan transactions that were talked about testified at the trial, they said, they, that– Donald Trump was a highly sought after whale, they called me a whale. I don't know if that's good or bad. I don't know if they meant a whale from the standpoint of being a little heavy or a whale, because I got a lot of money, but I think they meant the second. But he's a whale of a client, we love him. But he's a whale of a client, one of the strongest personal balance sheets that they've ever seen and he was actually very overqualified for the loan, I didn't even need this loan. Those banks earned more than $100 million in profits doing business with me and my companies. They were very happy and they testified that way. The expert witness, one of the most respected anywhere in the country, anywhere in the United States, said that my financial statements were the best that he's ever seen, that's not bad. The best that he's ever seen. This was a case of satisfied banks and insurance companies, which made a lot of money dealing with me and a lot of very happy money and good money. Great financial statements. The best– really great financial statements that didn't even include the most valuable asset, the Trump brand ironclad disclaimer. Do you know what a disclaimer is? We have an ironclad disclaimer, that's like buyer beware. It means do your own due diligence. Don't believe what you're reading. It's all good, but don't even believe it, go out and do your own due diligence. You have to go– you have to do that. We had an unbelievable disclaimer and the amazing properties, some of the best, all over the world and highly under leverage, we're very under leveraged as a company, I had very little debt, a lot of cash because we built a great company and you know unlike these other politics options, I knew it would happen. I didn't think would be this much, but I knew I would lose a billion or $2 billion, if I was honest, running for president and being president, and that's what I lost. Maybe a couple of billion dollars, and it was the best, it was the best thing I ever did because we've made our country. We made it great [cheers and applause].They've blown it, but we're gonna make it greater than ever before. We're gonna make it greater than ever before, but these other guys, they go in, they have no money, all of a sudden, they're rich. Look at Nancy Pelosi. She's worth, like, $150 million [cheers and applause]. The judge, one of the least respected in New York State, said that Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida– now you don't really know too much about it, but it's very valuable real estate, let me put it that way– was worth $18 million in order to try to make his case. By doing that, he brought the values way down, he tried to make his case, when in actuality it's worth anywhere from 50 to 100 times that amount. And the appraisers say that, that's not me saying it. The biggest broker in Florida said it. Wait till you hear about the unconstitutional gag order. That's gonna be great. The– a justice, this justice, this judge–he gagged– he doesn't want me to talk. You're not allowed to talk, because when you hear me talk, you'll say ohh, wow, this is a corrupt system. The case was brought under a consumer fraud statute that has never, ever been used before for this purpose. In fact, a very unfriendly media company, they hate me, said that they studied litigation going back many, many years, and no case, they had not one case, was ever brought like this. In the history of New York State, this is the only one. I wonder if they were doing that for political purposes or for election interference. This is merely an election interference ploy by a crazed lunatic attorney general. Did you ever see this attorney general? She's a lunatic, working closely with a very bad judge. No jury was allowed. I wasn't allowed a jury. You're not allowed a jury because under the statute, they have the right to do whatever they want to do. It's so unconstitutional. And they refused to send this disgusting charade to the commercial division within the court system where you have– hopefully you'd find a competent judge, and they would have looked at it and it would have never even been brought. The Democrat club-controlled Judge [Arthur] Engoron has already been reversed four times on this case alone. It's a record. Never happened before. Every time we went up, he got reversed and hopefully the whole thing is going to be thrown out and reversed. And if justice is anything in New York State, we'll win because New York State's in a lot of problems. The judges and prosecutors that were dealing with me are essentially all the same, different wrappings, tone, manner, but always the same coordinated and overly nasty result. They are nasty. These are Democrats that definitely hate me. They hate you too. I have to tell you. Whether New York City or State, Fulton County– what do you think of Fani [Willis]? Fani. What do you think, Fani? Huh, huh? F-A-N-I. That's pronounced 'fanny' but you're not allowed to say– it's 'fawny'. Oh boy, oh boy. That's Fulton County, that's Atlanta. Or Washington DC that people couldn't care less about justice. These people, they're not looking for justice. They only care about how to stop Crooked Joe Biden's political opponent, that's me, and how to inflict as much pain as possible. But here we are. They've been doing this for seven years and we won, excuse me, we won twice, and now we're gonna win a third time [cheers and applause]. We'll win a third time. And the second time we did better than we did the 1st. There's no courtroom decorum or respect, you gotta see these judges, they're screaming, they're like lunatics. There's no respect, there's no decorum, especially for someone that they know hasn't done anything wrong. We haven't done anything wrong. We've done nothing wrong. This last case is– we haven't done anything wrong. How 'bout the one 2 weeks ago? A woman– I'm saying, who the hell is she? Who is the woman? It's so unfair what's happening in our country. Our court system is a mess. What's happening in our country, they have to straighten it out. All you see is bitterness and revenge and hatred. Judge Engoron just fined me $355,000,000 for doing everything right. Three hundred and fifty-five. And these repulsive abuses of power are not just an attack on me, they're really an attack on you and all Americans. It's a disgusting, it's a disgusting thing. I deal with the bank. The bank is happy. There's no victims, there's no anything. Three hundred and fifty-five million. I paid off a mortgage for a tiny fraction of that amount. I borrowed money, and they wanted me to borrow the money, I didn't even need the money, they want– because that's what they do. They loan money. They like to loan it to good people. So, they loan me money and they, they charge me a fine in New York State, nobody's going back to New York State. A lot of people are leaving. A lot of businesses. But they fined me 355 million dollars [cheers and applause]. It's the law– nothing like this has ever happened. This judge is a lunatic. And if you've ever watched him, and the attorney general may be worse, may be worse, you ever watch her? I will get Donald Trump. Her campaign. I will get Donald Trump. I promise I will get him. She knows nothing about me. Nothing about me. She says, I will get him. As a result of this decision, businesses are going to flee New York State, they already are, taking with them tens of thousands of jobs 'cuz they can't subject themselves to this. And if this persecution of political opponents continues, no one will want to do business in the United States of America any longer. We will truly become a third-world country. We are going to be– we are already in many ways. If you look at our border, we are worse than a third-world country 'cuz there's never, ever in history been a border like that. Joe Biden and the fascists that control him are a threat to democracy. They're a threat to democracy. Now he's not smart enough to know that, but he's got people that control– the guy can't even walk off a platform. No, he can't find the stairs. He can't put two sentences together. And I'm not gonna imitate him, cause every time I imitate him, they say Donald Trump couldn't find his way off. No, every time. 'Cuz they're fake news. That's a lotta fake news back there [points to back of room]. Lotta fake news. No every time I imitate him, last week I imitated him, and you know the way he goes like this [flinches head], he finishes his speech, it takes about 2 and a half minutes 'cuz that's when his energy runs out, right? You know, energy. You know, he's got a lot of energy. What happened to that cocaine in the White House? Whatever ha– he's got a lot of energy, this guy. You know, I never spoke about him until they indicted me, and once they indicted me, I can now just speak the way I want to speak. He's a corrupt person. He's a horrible president. The worst we've ever had. The happiest man in our country today is a man named Jimmy Carter. Because he is considered a brilliant president by comparison. That's true. He's brilliant. Congress ought to impeach Crooked Joe Biden for attacking his political opponent by weaponizing the DOJ, FBI, and even local DAs and attorney generals against his opponent, me. They ought to do that. As Byron York, did you ever hear Byron York? Great writer from the Washington Examiner said, quote, the Justice Department forbids prosecutorial interference with elections. Very simple. The guidelines are very clear now. He's just writing the rules. He's a great talent and he's writing the rules and he's quoting the rules 'cuz nobody knows him. No, not even lawyers seem to know him. Federal prosecutors and agents, they never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements for the purpose of affecting any election or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or a political party. Now, so, they're saying you can't be doing what they're doing to me now because we're in the midst of an election. We just had 3 beauties and actually 4, including the islands, we won 'em all in landslides, you're not allowed to do what they're doing. You've got South Carolina coming up, Michigan, coming up and then Super Tuesday coming up in two weeks. And they want me so badly these guys because you know what? We're beating Biden by– we're clobbering this guy. Who the hell wouldn't? We're beating him [cheers and applause]. Prosecutor 'Deranged' Jack Smith is in a very big hurry– I mean, this guy is working so hard. He's a crooked guy. 'Deranged' Jack Smith. He's a prosecutor. They brought him out to try and do damage. But– and he's done a lot of damage to a lot of people. And he's been overturned by the United States Supreme Court unanimously. But he always fails because he goes too far. He's a, he's an animal. But he's not allowed to say why, but the reason has been obvious all along. He wants Trump to be tried and convicted so that we get hurt for the November 5th date and he's not going to hurt us because this is– my poll numbers today are much higher than they were three months ago. Because of this [cheers and applause]. It's our poll. Our. It's actually our poll because we're all in this thing together. We're all in this mess together. We're going to straighten this country out. We cannot let this injustice stand, and that's why I will fight Crooked Joe Biden's weaponized persecution at every step, and we will win. We're gonna win, this is going to be the biggest win ever [cheers and applause]. This is going to be bigger than 2016. Be bigger than 2016. With your support, we're going to rocket the Republican nomination. We are going to get this. We're going to have so many voters out there that whether they cheat or not, it's not gonna matter [cheers and applause]. You know, at a certain– because they only cheat. How the hell do you get elected if you have open borders and high interest rates and you can't buy a car? And if you do buy a car, they want you to buy an electric car, which doesn't go very far. And the United Auto Workers, this guy, Shawn Fain, what he– what, the contract that he entered in, you know, all those cars are going to be made in China within three years. I hope they know that. The auto workers are all– I think the auto workers– I met a couple of them back– raise your hand if you're– there' one guy right there [points to crowd member]. Do you agree with me? He sold you out. Where is– I had a guy, he had the strongest build I've ever seen. I said I'd love a body like that. Where is that guy? Where is that– right there's one [points to crowd member]. These guys are so– you're lifting, you know, a lot of stuff. You gotta– by nature– and then they go and work out after work. I mean, explain that one. But no, I met a lot of the auto workers backstage and they're great people, but they're being sold out. We're going to bring auto workers back to the– we're going to have all sorts. You want, you want electric. You want a hybrid. We're bringing everything back. You can have your choice. The problem is, electric doesn't go very far, you know. You're, you're driving along and you're petrified, oh my, I'm, I'm going to– they say next charging booth, 93 miles. Go West 93 miles. The whole thing is crazy. And you know, if we built all the charging booths that are necessary, our country would go bankrupt. You know that, Pete [Hoekstra], the country, it would cost like $3 trillion more money. It's the craziest thing I've ever heard. But we're dealing with a lot– he's a very low IQ individual, our President. I would be willing to bet that Joe Biden, of all the presidents, we've had a lot of 'em, he is the lowest IQ individual of any president ever. Ever [cheers and applause]. And he's telling us to get rid of our, to get rid of our cars, get– they wanna make trucks all electric. The problem is, they don't go far either. And you'd have to have half of the capacity of the truck would be devoted to a battery. I don't know if you know this. They want to make our army tanks. You know, the beautiful army tanks. They want to make them into all electric. So that as was– as we enter a country, to obliterate it, at least we give them nice clean air, beautiful air. Beautiful air to breathe as we obliterate them. 'Crooked' Joe has ordered a hit job on Michigan manufacturing with his insane electric vehicle mandate. Do the auto workers here, of which we have a lot, do you agree with that? There's the guy [points to crowd member]. Come on up here. Come here. Come on. Come on up. This never works out, you know that, right? That's OK. Now I like this guy, I met him backstage, he's great. He's good. Come on up. Secret Service is thrilled. You know, when we do this– secret– and you look at the guy, he could rip you apart. Come on up. I like this guy. Come on, come here. [crowd member goes on stage] [cheers and applause]. CROWD MEMBER ON STAGE: I love you brother. TRUMP: Say something, say something. Take, wait, take that thing off [pulls on crowd member's jacket]. Take that. Look at this guy. CROWD MEMBER ON STAGE: Thank you, President Trump. We got your back. The auto workers are going to support this guy like we did in 16, 20, we're going to do it again in 24. Everybody's going to get out and vote. We're going to vote, 85 million of us are going to vote for this guy, they can't cheat enough to beat him [cheers and applause] [to Trump] I love you brother. Keep fighting the fight. TRUMP: Well, that worked out well. Look, I met him backstage, I liked him. I said look at these muscles, this guy's got muscles all over the place. I said, what do you do? He said I'm an auto worker. I said that's too bad, because you're not gonna have a job in two years. And he agrees with me. But I want to thank him. And you did a great job. I think he was more effective than I could ever be actually. Thank you very much. We don't wanna see it happen. We wanna bring manufacturing back. You know, you've lost already 54% over the years, 54% of auto manufacturing, and you're gonna lose the rest of it very fast. A lot of it coming out of Michigan. A lot of it coming out. So we're gonna get it back and we're gonna have, we're gonna have big investments from other companies and we're, we're looking– look, we're gonna put tariffs on cars. I did it with China. I stopped that inflow with China. We took in $444 billion from China. No president has ever taken in 10 cents. And you know what? I protected the auto workers by doing that because cars were actually taxed when they come in. And if we don't do that– that's what they do to us. That's what they do to us. So we're gonna bring manufacturing back and look, I get along great, the President of Mexico, great person, great, great person. But what Mexico's done to this this country in terms of auto– do you realize, do you realize what Mexico's done in terms of the auto workers? A friend of mine builds big plants. He's a big supporter. Build big, big auto plants. I said I'd like to go take a look at some of your plants because I find it very interesting. I wanna know exactly what I'm– I like to build and I like to see things like this. He said good, but we really have to go to Mexico. I said, what do you mean? You build them here, right? Yeah, I do, but the big ones are being built in Mexico. I said, isn't that a shame, right? This is just a guy telling me, you know, he's no, no axe to grind. He said the big plants uhh– President, he's a friend of mine, he used to call me Donald, now he calls me President. I said, call me Donald. He said, I'll try. And he said, Donald, the big plants, the big plants, the ones that you really have to see are the ones that we're building in Mexico. They're unbelievable. I said, uhh, how much bigger, how much better? He said far more advanced, double, triple the size of what's happening in the United States. So, President, I said, Donald, President, he couldn't do it, but that's nice that he couldn't– you know what, that's a sign of respect, right? It's a– he couldn't call me by– my all– for 20 years he called me Donald. He can't call me Don– I have that with a lot of friends. They used to call me Donnie. They used to call me Don, DJ, now they all call me President [cheers and applause]. I say call me– loosen, I say loosen up. Loosen up. You've been my friend for 25 years. Loosen up. But the big plants are all being built in Mexico. And I'll, I'll give you a worse one. China now, is building plants in Mexico and selling the cars to the United States. What the hell does that do for us? They're building plants in Mexico right across the border, and the cars are being sold tax free into the United States. I will stop that the first day. The first day [cheers and applause]. A vote for Biden is a vote to send 10s of thousands of Michigan jobs to China and other places that we don't want them to go. A vote for Trump is a vote to keep those manufacturing jobs in America and add a lot of jobs. We could get within a very short period of time and just through taxation of people that don't love us, we could get everybody to start moving back here because it wouldn't be economically feasible for them to build in Mexico or China or other places, and it will just take the stroke of a pen and I can do that very quickly. Biden's ridiculous electric vehicle mandate and his 'Green New Scam' are the all– I mean, these are what they're pushing– the 'Green New Scam'. Nobody even knows what the hell's going on. The 'Green New Scam' they talk about, you know, they don't want anything built with any form of petroleum product. They want wind. But what happens if the wind doesn't blow? They don't know. You know, it's hard to store wind energy, right? You know that. So, they want wind or they want solar, they want all things. It's not big enough to fire up your plants. It's not good. It's not consistent. So Germany tried it and they went bust, and now they're building coal plants all over the place. And they're building nuclear, they closed up all their nuclear, all their coal, now they're reopening them. It didn't work. They have suffered greatly. Other countries, it hasn't worked. Why do we have to be doing this? It's not gonna work. We need to fire up our plants with petroleum if it's necessary. Whatever the hell it takes. Nice, clean, natural gas. Did, did you ever hear of a thing called Clean Coal? Clean coal. They do, they do great things with coal too. And we have more of all of these products than anybody anywhere in the world. I call it liquid gold. We have more liquid gold than any country anywhere in the world, including Saudi Arabia, including Russia. And we don't use it. We're now buying oil from Venezuela. We're not buying oil, we're buying tar. We're buying tar. It's very thick. And you know where we clean the tar? In Houston, Texas. It's the only refinery in the whole country that can clean this tar and that's what we do. And that goes into the air and I guess, you know, they'll figure out what happens with it, but it's very sad. China is building a coal plant a week, a big coal plant a week, and then they see– well, they finally fired [John] Kerry, he got fired. To me, that was a great thing. He'd go to China, they're building a plant a week, and he'd tell them all of the problems with coal, and they're saying, oh yes, yes, we agree, we agree. In the meantime, they authorized about 70 new plants for next year. The whole thing we are like this stupid country, the stupid country. But we will be the stupid country no longer. And we had it going [cheers and applause]. You know, we built, we built the greatest economy in the history of our country, and we will get it back and we will do it again and we're gonna close that border and we're gonna drill, baby, drill, and we're gonna do all sort of things [cheers and applause]. We had the strongest border, we had the strongest border in the recorded history of our country by far. We had it down to a level that they'd never seen before. We built 571 miles of wall. We had it down– we were gonna build another 200. It was all done. Then the election was rigged, and we couldn't put it up. We had three weeks. It was all there. And all they had to do was put up the slats, put 'em up. It was all done. 200 miles. Actually built 300 miles more than I said we were gonna do. All they had to do is put it up and they, you know what, they took over and they didn't put it up. They sold the stuff for 5 cents on the dollar. Think of it. For 5 cents. And it's expensive. It's what the Border Patrol wanted. You know, I wanted concrete slabs. And they wanted to have steel, rebar, and concrete. All three. And they were right. You had to have a fence to see through. I said, what the hell do you have to see through? What are we looking at? They wanted to– I did everything the bor– even the panel on top, you know, it's called an anti-climb paddle. You know that? Because it makes it very hard for people– do you ever watch these people? With 70 lbs of drugs on their back, they go up. They're unbelievable. They're like athletes. But when you have the panel, the anti-climb panel, it's very hard for them to get across. So I put– I gave them everything they wanted. 571 miles we built, and that's why that happened and that's why we had such good numbers. And then I had another 200 miles that was ready to be installed, would have been done in three weeks and these guys said, we don't wanna do it. And I said, I said, they want open borders. Nobody believed it. Why would they want open borders? They either hate the country or they're stupid and they're not stupid because anybody that could cheat on elections the way they do is not stupid. So, they either hate the country or they're stupid. So, we are going to close up the border like we had. We had the best border ever [cheers and applause]. You know, I went to Mexico, and you know this, and I got along really great, but I went to, to them, I told them, look, fellas, you gotta give us 28,000 soldiers. They looked at me like, what a stupid request. What? Why the hell would– they going like, why would we give him 28,000? You know, they're laughing. They think we're like, we're all a bunch of dummies, right. I said, no, no, you have to cause they've taken advantage of, including taking 32%, by the way, 32% of what you had here is right now being done in Mexico. That's over the last 20 years, 32%, and they'll take the rest of it too. And remember the story about the plan, but think of this, so I said, no, you have to give us 28,000 soldiers because we're building the wall and we need protection and you're allowing people to walk through on the caravans, thousands and thousands of people coming from all over the world. Yesterday they had many from the Congo. Welcome to the Congo people because– and where do you come in the Congo? Where do you live? We were in prison. What for? Murder. Ohh, great. So they're being put– and who can blame? They're coming from Africa. They're coming from Asia. They're coming from different parts of the Middle East. They're coming from Yemen. We're bombing Yemen. You know, here this idiot is again bombing, bombing. When I came in, they were bombing. I got it stopped. You don't have to bomb. Every bomb is a million dollars, you know that. One million, every time you see a little flash it's a million. But more importantly, you're killing a lot of people. You don't have to kill the people. We don't wanna kill people. We want a solution to things [cheers and applause]. You would have never had Ukraine and Russia. You would have never had Israel. Israel would have never been attacked. Ukraine would have never been attacked. [Vladimir] Putin would have never attacked. In fact, Putin said the other day. No, I prefer Biden as president. I said, I know why. I stopped. I stopped Nord Stream too. It was totally stopped. I stopped Nord Stream too. Biden came and he approved it. But he stopped the keystone, so he let Russia build their pipeline to Germany and other places. But he stopped the Keystone. 48,000 jobs and the head– remember this, for the auto workers, the head of the pipeline union endorsed 'Sleepy' Joe Biden. Endorsed him. Now he should be out of a job. And all those guys, now almost every worker voted for me because they're smart, you know. But you have the same thing in the auto workers. Most of the auto workers are going to vote for me. I'm going to bring jobs back [cheers and applause]. You're going to lose all your jobs. And we're waiting for the Teamsters, and I will tell you the biggest threat to your unions is millions of people coming across the border, 'cuz you're not gonna have your jobs anymore. Even that good looking strong guy with those beautiful muscles [points to crowd member], he's not gonna have his job because they'll have somebody else take it for one-third the price and you know, etcetera, etcetera. You're not gonna– right? You're not– look, he's– don't laugh. He's laughing. Don't laugh. We got to be serious here. The truth is, though, when you have millions of people coming in, they're gonna take your jobs, they're gonna take the Teamster jobs, you know, we're waiting because the Teamsters haven't endorsed a Republican in many, many years, and they're having a hard ti","me with this. How do they endorse a man who's a low-IQ individual? How do they do it? That's, that's 'Sleepy' Joe. How do they endorse– or 'Crooked' Joe. Which is a better name, 'Crooked' Joe Biden or 'Sleepy' Joe Biden? [cheers and applause]. OK, wait, let's do a free poll. Let's do a free poll. OK, Hoekstra, Hoekstra this is a free poll. See, I don't pay for– you know, these guys go out, they pay a million dollars for a poll. Most of the polls, they don't even go sample. They just give it, they say send me the check. No, this is a free poll. Who likes– I'll go 'Sleepy' first, then I'll go 'Crooked'. Who likes 'Sleepy' Joe Biden? [cheers and applause]. Who likes 'Crooked' Joe Biden? [louder cheers]. Yeah. Because I retired the name crooked from Hillary [Clinton]. You know that, right? I retired the name 'Crooked' because– this was one of the best days in our life. I announced I was gonna retire 'cuz I thought it was more befitting, she didn't matter anymore. I thought it was more befitting for Joe because he's the most corrupt president we've ever had. He's a Manchurian candidate, actually. You know what a Manchurian candidate is? This guy's getting so much money from so many countries that they can't even figure it out. When I came into office, American manufacturing was on its knees, gasping its last breaths. Eight long years of [Barack] Obama and 'Crooked' Joe Biden who backed NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever, and China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Great deal, fellas. TPP and every other globalist portrayal of Michigan workers for 50 years, they were back in all these horrible deals. They were really back in China. Just as I promised, I withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in my very first week. That saved your auto industry. You wouldn't have, and you don't have, much left anyway, but that saved you the 42% that you have left. I ended the disaster known as NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made, and replaced it with a brand new USMCA the best trade deal ever made, they say [cheers and applause]. And in particular, it was salvation for the American auto industry and the American labor. Now they're going to these all-electric cars. So, everything's gonna be gone. Everything's gonna be gone. So sad. So sad. Nobody wants to buy these cars either. That's the other problem. They don't go far. I want to be more sophisticated. And I said give me a good reason why we shouldn't buy electric. Why, why should we buy it? And the guy goes, well, Sir, they don't go far. I said, they don't go far. That sounds so basic. That's like a first-grader. They don't go far. I said that's about as accurate– they don't go far. They also are very expensive, much more expensive. And they require far fewer jobs to make. That means Michigan, you're gonna get so screwed, I can't believe it. I can't believe that that guy was able to convince– you know, I thought he was, like a tough guy cause he said we're gonna go on strike, we're gonna do– he goes on strike, he signed the worst deal. You're gonna, you're getting nice wages for a short period of time, but you're going to be out of jobs in two years. So just remember it. I also, and you know, they're trying to renegotiate a whole big pile of things, as you know, all of these deals, the USMCA, Mexico and Canada are trying to renegotiate the deal now with Biden. And Biden's looking at them, he has no idea what they're talking about. I have no idea what is the USMCA? What countries are they? What countries are they? Ohh, that's Mexico and Canada. Oh, I have no idea. By the way, isn't this better than being on this freaking teleprompter, seriously? I can only do this with friends [cheers and applause]. I can only do it with friends. Ohh, it's terrible, but they always criticize me. For instance, sometimes I'll use the name Barack Hussein Obama instead of– and your President, Barack Hussein, remember Rush [Limbaugh]? He used to shout Barack Hussein Obama. And I'll say because he's– a lot of people think he's still the president. A lot of people think he's really running Biden. He's got a lot of his people in there. So, I'll say your President Barack Hussein Obama, and they'll say the next day Donald Trump didn't know who the president of our country is. He thought it was Barack. It's true. It's true. It's true with the stairs, too, they're always– I cannot do it anymore. Everyone says, please do the stairs. But every time I do the stairs, I walk to one. I walked to– then I walk into a wall in the back. They say, see, he couldn't find his way off the stage either. These people are so dishonest [points to media in back of room]. They are terrible. But I, I don't want to be, I don't want to be sarcastic anymore, 'cuz it's too painful. I also renegotiated Obama's Korea trade deal to fully restore the protective tariff on foreign, foreign pickup trucks. Now, if I didn't do that, you know, you make more money with pickup trucks than any other vehicle. If I didn't do that, right, if I didn't do that, you would be dying here because without the pickup truck, uh, you would have had a problem. And I put the tax on– it was all set to expire and South Korea was so happy. Everybody was so happy. It was good. It didn't expire because I extended it and I got it. And if I didn't do that, you would have had a big problem. You would have had a big problem. I took on Communist China like no administration in history. Bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars, pouring into our treasury when no other President had gotten 10 cents. You look back, not one other president got 10 cents from China. They all said, ohh, China is a developing nation. Well, we're a developing nation too. Look at our cities. They're falling apart. Look at our country, it's falling apart. We're like a third-world nation. Look at our airports. Look at our airports. I mean, how bad are the airports. And as part of my strong trade policies, I kept Chinese cars the hell out of America through taxation, it's very easy [cheers and applause]. You know, I used to argue with Angela, Angela Merkel. You ever see the hat, 'Trump was right about everything'? I was right basically about– but I used to say Angela, let me a question, it's just you don't treat us well. You don't take our cars. Ohh, we would love to, we would– ohh really. I said, how many Chevrolets do you have in Munich? Uhh, probably none. I said, that's right. How many Chevrolets do you have in Germany? Maybe none, that's right. But we take their BMW's, we take their Volkswagens, we take their Mercedes Benzes, we take everything. We're stupid, we're so stupid to allow this to happen. They won't take anything having to do with us. And I had them all broken down. Everything was good. We were doing good. And then all of a sudden, you know, we had the COVID hit us. And we did a great job in that. We never got acknowledged for that. But what China did to us with COVID– to the world– $60 trillion of damage and you know, millions and millions of people killed. But we did a great job, came out of it– when I left the stock market price was higher than when just before COVID came in, or as I call it, the China virus 'cuz I want to be accurate [cheers and applause]. I imposed a magnificent 27.5% tariff on all Chinese automobiles, and it remains in place to this day. You know why Biden can't take it off? Because they make so much money with it. They wanna take it off so badly, 'cuz you know, they pay them a lot of money. Johnny gives 'em a lot of money, so he'd like to, he'd like to reciprocate. But I just wanna say to Michigan, you're welcome, because if I didn't do that, you would have a big problem [cheers and applause]. Under the Trump administration you were better off, your family was better off, your neighbors were better off, your communities were better off, and our country was a lot better off [cheers and applause]. America was stronger, richer, safer, and more confident than ever when you had me sitting behind that beautiful, resolute desk. You know what the resolute desk– beautiful. In the Oval Office. You know, we have– as a President when you get elected, they give you a choice of seven desks. You have 7 desks. They're all beautiful. They all represent something different, but resolute, represented Ronald Reagan, represented some people that I respect and like. I also think it's beautiful. But we got to get back behind that resolute desk. We have to get back [cheers and applause]. We have to get back. Stop, stop these fascists from taking over. They're destroying our country, by the way, in case you haven't noticed. In case you haven't noticed, they are destroying our country. By contrast, Joe Biden spent his entire career hurting your family while his family, his family, raked in millions and millions of dollars, and he was making bad deals for our country. He was– the guy has a lot of houses all over the place. I mean, the guy– they start off with nothing, then they're worth millions and millions of dollars. The most they ever made was 179,000 dollars. And yet they have houses that are worth millions and millions. You know, the beach cottage, and the this one, and the that one. Ocean, the nice waves. The nice garage with the, with the Corvette, right. The Corvette. And the documents under the Corvette. And he's, you know, the Corvette's sitting on classified documents, and it's OK for him, but for me, when you have it sealed at Mar-a-Lago, that's no good. You know. No, no, uhh, it's a terrible double standard. How about that? Did you see that? And he's also got documents in Chinatown. He's got documents at Penn. They're falling out of boxes. Those boxes are heavily used too. Those documents are going in and out. But how about the boxes in Chinatown, Chinatown. And he gets paid by China. The whole thing– we have such a double standard. It's a disgrace. Just this week, House investigators revealed that 'Crooked' Joe showed up at a business meeting hosted by the Chinese Communist Party-controlled energy companies, and all of this, and they were paying his son a lot of money. Shee– I'm surprised to hear that. 'Crooked' Joe gave a 10-minute presentation and days later, Hunter [Biden]'s company got a 3 million dollar check out of China. 'Crooked' Joe is not working for you, he's working for himself because he gets a piece. Don't they have a little statement about him? You know, he gets a nice chunk out of everything. As President Harry Truman said, show me a man that gets rich by being a politician, and I will show you a crook [cheers and applause]. True. That's true. Hey, by the way, it's nice in this– you know, I thought it was going to be like freezing in here, Pete. It's very nice. It's beautiful. Is everybody having a good time talking about this horror show? [cheers and applause]. Is there any place better than being at a Trump rally? [cheers and applause]. I'll tell you the people outside they can't get in, they're not so thrilled out there. Thank you very much. Look at that. I mean, this place is packed. This set a new record. You're not supposed to have this many people. This place is packed. Thank you. CROWD: [chanting] WE LOVE TRUMP. WE LOVE TRUMP. WE LOVE TRUMP. WE LOVE TRUMP. TRUMP: I love you too. I love you too. Or I wouldn't be doing this. I had a nice life, you know. I had a nice life. I had nice places. I had a great company. I had everything. And now look, I go through this crap because you know what? We made America great again. We're going to make it greater than ever before. We're gonna take it back [cheers and applause]. It's the question I get asked most often. They say, Sir, how do you do it? I've been asked by the toughest guys, the toughest Wall Street guys, you think they're tough, but they're really not. They're not as tough as the auto workers, I'll tell you right now. But they think they are. They think they're tough. But a lot of them come to me and they'll say, how do you do it? You go through all these subpoenas. You got indicted. Now in my whole life, I didn't know what the word, I didn't know what indictment meant. You got indicted more than Alphonse Capone. Scarface. They say, how do you take it? How do you do it? I say it doesn't bother me. It's like I'm just doing something for some incredible people. It's called the American people [cheers and applause]. It's called I'm doing something for America. It doesn't bother me. And you know, when you see the love in this room and when you see the polls, I mean, maybe I'd feel differently if I was losing by a lot or a little, but you know, we're leading Biden by so much. We're, we're beating him by so much. We have a competitor, a bird-brain who is getting decimated by him. But we're leading him by so much. And that means there's– look, that means what we're doing is just sort of– I just feel very good about it. I mean, you know, maybe I'm wired a little bit differently, I don't know. I don't know. But I feel good about it. Biden always puts America last. He didn't even have the decency to go to East Palestine, Ohio, until yesterday. He would have been better off not going. The mayor is a great guy. I went there very early. The mayor's a great guy. The people are great people, they're unbelievable people. The guy goes like a year later. And you know, you talk about pandering, that's I think the ultimate pandering. He would have been a lot better– whoever advised him, the same person that advises him to go to beaches, you like, go to the beach, you look great in a bathing suit. If he would have gone to the beach and left the border alone. We had Tom [Thomas] Homan. We had the best people. Brandon Judd. We had that border, the best it's ever been. If you would have left it alone, we wouldn't have, I think the number's gonna be 18 million people by the time this nightmare ends, I think it's 18 million people. Think of it. But I went to East Palestine, and I was there and met the people and they loved me and I loved them. But I put workers first and I put America first, nobody else does that [cheers and applause]. Not too many. If 'Crooked' Joe gets four more years, our country is done. It's done, it's done. But we gotta get out and vote. We gotta vote like that– and that includes in the primary. I mean, you don't have much of a primary here. I think we have a 60-point lead, 70-point lead. But you know what? It's important to send the Democrats a message. We gotta send them a message for November. We gotta get out and vote. You go next week; you vote because we have to put out the message. We have to get out. We have to let 'em know that a freight train is coming in November [cheers and applause]. Biden's plan calls for raising taxes by over 6 trillion dollars. Congratulations, everybody. I gave you the largest tax cut in the history of our country. And by the way, we took in much more revenue because of that. But he wants to raise your taxes by quadruple. A tax hike that would be the biggest tax hike in the history of our country. That's what he wants to do. I will make the Trump tax cuts permanent. He wants to end them. They're the biggest– I gave you the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. I gave you the biggest regulation cuts in the– that's why you had the biggest job numbers we've ever had. I'll also pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. You know what that is? When a country charges us a tax we say ohh, what is it? 100% good. We're charging them the same tax, okay? [cheers and applause]. Reciprocal. It's reciprocal. So if China is charging us a hundred dollar tariff, we charge them a hundred dollar tariff. It's quite simple actually. It's basically saying you screw us, and we screw you [cheers and applause]. And you know what's gonna end, you know it's gonna end up? They'll drop it, everybody drops it, You know, let's forget the bookkeeping, right. But no, we were treated very unfairly by virtually every country. We did so much. I renegotiated the deals with South Korea. I renegotiated the deals with Japan. I made 'em so much better with Abe, who was an incredible guy, he was assassinated. But, Shinzo Abe was an incredible guy. One of my really good friends, he was great. But I came to him, I remember, 'cuz Japan took such advantage of us, that I came to him, I said, Shinzo, it's not working, it's so unfair. I mean, it's so one-sided. He goes, I know. I was waiting for you to come see me. I said didn't anybody else? He said nobody ever came to see us. I can't believe we got away with it for so many years. They expect it. And we renegotiated the deal. It didn't take that long. We got 'em– we got a great deal out of it. And as tariffs on foreign countries go up, taxes on American workers and families will come down. They'll come down very dramatically. It will almost solve our budget deficit– so the Reciprocal Trade Act, let's say it's 10%. Let's say it's 15%. This will go a long way. All these countries, they want to do business in the United States. It's an honor to do business in– we have to bring that back. For them to come in and take advantage of our country, it's an honor, you should have to pay for that. For them to come in and take our jobs and take our money and take everything out of our country, the guts out of our country, for them to manufacture cars and send them in so that we don't manufacture cars. So, the Reciprocal Trade Act, it's very simple, they gotta pay. So, if they pay 10% or 15, I don't believe it's going to affect the business that much, but it's so much money that would be coming into our country that it will largely knock out deficits to a large extent. The deficit will be wiped out overnight [cheers and applause]. And I think they'll be doing, I think they'll be doing almost the same business. The only difference is that they won't make quite as much money, 'cuz right now they're making so much money. In the case of China, they've rebuilt military to rival our military. With the kind of money, five-hundred billion dollars a year that they take out. So we don't want that to happen. The only ones who hate it are the globalists because basically, they hate America. Globalists, I think – really believe, I really believe it, and that's plenty of Republicans, although it seems to be a dying breed within the Republican 'cuz Republican is mostly MAGA [cheers and applause]. MAGA. Make America Great Again. Globalists. Globalists. Now the globalists, I think they're, they're on respirators. They're, they're a dying breed I think. I hope. They are not, they are not good for our country. It's no wonder Joe Biden and his thugs are so desperate to stop us. They know that we are the only ones who can stop them. They know that. You know, we did it in 2016, remember that beautiful night in 2016 where they had Florida locked, there was going to be– and then all of a sudden, at about 9:01, Donald Trump has won the state of Florida [cheers and applause]. Ooh, that was bad. And they go up their call thing, then they go Donald Trump– then we win Alabama, we win this– Donald Trump has won the state of Georgia by a lot. We did– I think we did much better the 2nd time with Georgia by the way. But Donald Trump has won the state of George. Donald Trump has won the state of South Carolina by a lot. Donald Trump has won the state of North–. We ran that coast up and for– and they kept saying ohh. They said, you know, with North Carolina, they said don't worry about it. That's our fire stop. That's us. He, he can't win that one. And then they go, this was a whole big thing for an hour they were saying, that stop is North Carolina, to get– Donald Trump has won– the say– they're like having a heart attack. Ohh, those people. Remember the crazy woman in the Convention Center with the hair and the glasses and the bonnet. And she's screaming that poor woman, aye-yai -yai. And she's screaming, you know what she's screaming for? She wants continued failure in our country. All of their attacks and all of these corrupt persecutions that they're doing are only happening because I am running for President and leading big in the polls and won a presidential race that we weren't supposed to win. You know, they all said– it's funny, I came here, and I came to four or five other states in the last couple of days and we were having rallies 45, 50 thousand people, and then I'd leave. And I kept hearing how we were gonna lose. And I can't– how come we're gonna lose? With Hillary, she'd come, she'd have like 300 people show up. With Joe, he'd come, he couldn't fill the circle, you know. Remember the 8 circles, good contractor, those circles are beautiful. I want to find out who is the contractor. They were beautiful circles. But they had eight circles and they had to put the fake news in those circles because they couldn't fill them up. And then I'd have 48, 50 thousand people at these rallies and I say how the hell– why are we gonna lose? And we ended up winning Michigan. Remember that? [cheers and applause]. That was a beautiful, that was a beautiful [inaudible]. And Wisconsin, we won Wisconsin, we won Pennsylvania, we won it all. In the latest Morning Consult Poll, ohh, and we're doing much better now than we ever did. Actually, as you know, we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016. We got millions and millions of more votes, Pete. Millions and millions of more votes. We got votes like nobody thought possible. But the election was rigged, it's just one of those things. But we're not going to let 'em rig at this time, that I can tell you. The latest Morning Consult poll, we're at 80% in the Republican Party and in the new– 80%– and in the new Fox poll, which tends to be not so such a good poll. We're beating Biden substantially here in Michigan like by a lot. And we're winning a historic 25% of the African American vote in this state [cheers and applause]. Nice, nice. By the way, the biggest change we're doing phenomenally with the African American voters. Remember criminal justice reform, helping their colleges and universities out like nobody ever did before, that was a big thing. All of the things we did– opportunity zones with Tim Scott, Tim Scott had this incredible idea for opportunity– it's one of the best economic development programs ever in the history of our country. Nobody talks about it. But we did a lot and the African American population understands it. The black population understands it. And with Hispanic, the same thing we're doing numbers that are 30, 40, 50% higher than they ever heard of before. We're winning places along the border that no Republican's ever won before. We're like a new party in a lot of ways. And we're getting the workers, we're getting the manufacturers, we're getting the guys that make the product, we're getting guys like my friend with the big muscles over there [points to crowd member]. We have a lot of auto workers, you know, we have a lot of auto workers in this room who are disgusted with the fact, because they're smart. Look at that guy, he's another guy [points to crowd member]. Look at him. You can build my car any day. You can [laughs] [cheers and applause]. You can build my car any day. And these are great people. These are great workers. These are talented, very talented people. This isn't just workers, these are very talented, brilliant people. The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024 [cheers and applause]. Every time the radical left Democrats, Marxist communists, and fascists indict me, I considered it a great badge of honor. I am being indicted for you. Never forget. I'm being indicted for you. [cheers and applause]. Thanks very much, I appreciate it. Never forget, our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. I will not do that [cheers and applause]. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. And in the end, they're not after me, they're after you. And I just happened to be standing in their way. That's what's happening. They're after you [cheers and applause]. We are pleased to be joined tonight by some incredible people that represent your state so well, including members of Congress. Lisa McClain, where's Lisa? [cheers and applause]. What a great woman. She's tough. Don't mess around with– she's a tough one, and she's great. Thank you, Lisa. You really are. You're doing a fantastic– you're a warrior. And Jack Bergman. Jack, thank you very much. [cheers and applause]. What a job. Two real good ones. Your new Michigan Republican Party chairman, former Congressman, Pete Hoekstra [cheers and applause]. I actually recommended– I said, do you think you could ever get this guy Hoekstra? He's unbelievable. And you were willing to do it, and I appreciate it. Everybody appreciates. We're gonna win this state. If we win Michigan, we win the election [cheers and applause]. You know? Thank you, Pete. Great. Got the best man. I said that. I said can you get Hoeksra? He was incredible. Everything he did in Congress, he was incredible. And then he was an unbelievable ambassador. He– everybody thought he was just about the best. And then I just said you got to get that guy, and he agreed to do it. We appreciate it. Thank you very much [cheers and applause]. State House Minority Leader Matt Hall. Matt. Thank you, Matt. Thank you, Matt. Great job. Former Michigan Supreme Court Justice Stephen Markman, Stephen, thank you. You're here someplace. Thank you, Steven. Thank you very much. And President of the Police Officers Association of Michigan, James Tignanelli [cheers and applause]. And a board member, Dwight Zahringer. Thank you, Dwight. Thank you very much. What a great job they do. Law enforcement, we're gonna take care of law enforcement [cheers and applause]. You know, we have the endorsement of almost every single law enforcement group in the country, and anybody that hasn't endorsed– people look at them, they say what the hell's wrong with you? But we've got the endorsement of just about every law enforcement, the sheriffs, everybody all over the country. From the very first day that we take back the White House from 'Crooked' Joe Biden, I believe we're going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country [cheers and applause]. We are so ready to go. In our first term, we appointed over 300 federal judges and three Supreme Court justices [cheers and applause]. Great people. We fully rebuilt the US military and created Space Force, first time in 78 years [cheers and applause]. Last one was Air Force. This was Space Force and it's a big deal. And for our great veterans, we passed VA Accountability and VA choice [cheers and applause]. Nobody could do it. They worked in them for 54 and for 56 years. We had the most secure border in U.S. history. We ended catch and release, and built 561 miles, think of it, we built this massive thing and then they go, and they just let everybody pour into our country. People weren't even trying to get in anymore. They knew they couldn't get in. And then they come in and they just come in in numbers that nobody's ever seen before. Nobody's ever seen a border like that. I just don't know who could, who could think it's a good thing? And remember, they're coming in from prisons. They're coming in from mental institutions, insane asylums. These are, these are people that we're not wanting in our country. The invasion of our country will affect our black population, Hispanic population, union population, and basically people with good, high paying jobs, more than any others. Union wages will be cut in half or more. And this is– these are the people that Biden's allowing to come in. Whether they have the talent or they don't have the talent, they're not gonna have the talent of the people right now. But they're gonna work for one-third the price, and uhh, you're gonna have a lot of unhappy union workers, that I can tell you. That includes the United Auto workers and the Teamsters, black and Hispanic workers, or basically anybody who has a high paying good job, will be losing their jobs by the millions. These people are gonna work for nothing. They're gonna work for very small amounts of money. You're gonna lose your jobs. It's so sad. No, it's so sad to see. It's common sense. You got 18 million people by the end of his term coming in. And they're gonna be working. They're gonna be taking the jobs of people that have lived here for a whole life, pay a lot of tax, they work hard, big talent. Biden's already giving work permits to two and a half million illegal aliens. I don't know if you know that, they don't cover it. We have a new category of crime in our country. It's called migrant crime, and it's taking over America. You know, in New York, what's happening with crime is it's through the roof. And it's called migrant– I call it a new category. I just came up with that name, but I think it's appropriate. It's a new category of crime where they go, and they beat up police officers. You've seen that. They go and they stab people, hurt people, shoot people. It's a whole new form. And they have gangs now that are making our gangs look like small potatoes, OK? Because Joe Biden allowed this to happen, we will call it from now on 'Biden migrant crime', OK? It's by 'Bigrant'– this is– we'll call it– I got it: Bigrant, let's call it by Bigrant. Biden crime. Bi– oh, that's good [cheers and applause].That's smart. Migrant crime. No, but you do you have a category of crime that we've never had. We've never had anything like this before. They're taking over the, the inner cities of our country by the thousands and thousands. They're coming into cities. They can't handle it. Even here in Oakland County, you're being overrun, and I will tell you one man said what are we gonna do about it? We're gonna have the largest deportation effort in the history ","of our country [cheers and applause]. We have no choice. We have no choice. We have no choice. It's a terrible thing. And we're gonna start with the really bad ones first. And you know the local police, they know who the bad ones are. They know, they knew, and we're going to take care of our local police. Your sheriff has recently stated that organized criminal squads of illegal alien gang members are hiding in the trees and breaking into rural and suburban Michigan, into your homes after dark, plundering them for jewelry, purses, electronics, cash, watches, and anything else they can get their hands on. That's what's happening in Michigan. It happened to that guy [points to crowd member]. Look, he's raising his hand. It happened to him. If you don't want to have illegal alien criminals crawling through your windows and going through your drawers, as the expression goes, then vote against 'Crooked' Joe Biden. Throw him the hell out of office [cheers and applause]. Before I even arrive– we got to. Look, look, if we have this regime, it's like a regime, and believe me, they are bad for democracy. What they're doing with elections, what they're doing with– what they're doing in Washington, DC with people putting 'em in jail for years and years and years. And they let Antifa get away with murder. It's just a horrible thing. It's a very bad thing and it's a very dangerous thing. Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the Presidency– we win. We are going to win, not me, we [cheers and applause]. I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. That war would have never happened if I were president. It was just reported that Biden believes that he did a fantastic job in this catastrophic withdrawal, do you believe that? The withdrawal, the withdrawal from Afghanistan was the most embarrassing moment I believe in the history of our country. If that success, and he thinks it was fine, it was– we lost 13 soldiers. We shouldn't have lost anybody. You know, I'm the one that set it up in the sense, but we had to get that 21, 20 years, but we had nobody shot at. We had nobody killed under my administration. They were killing our soldiers very much with, with the Obama-Biden mess. They were killing our soldiers. And I called up and I said get him on the phone. Abdul [Ghani Baradar]. He was the leader of the Taliban. I said, Abdul, you're killing our soldiers. Don't kill our soldiers anymore, Abdul. It was not a nice conversation. Then I said, uh, I said if it happens again, we're gonna hit you so hard you're not even gonna believe it [cheers and applause]. And he goes, he goes– yeah. He goes, uh, your Excellency, he called me your Excellency. Actually had a very nice way of speaking. He's still leading the Taliban, but now he's got $85 billion worth of our equipment, which he's selling a lot of. You know, they're the second or third largest seller of military equipment in the world, now they took 85 billion. We left 85 billion dollars. Thirteen soldiers dead. Many of these soldiers, no arms, no legs, obliterated. Many. 38 of them. At least 38 of them. Nobody ever mentions them. We have people that we left behind, too. We have American citizens that we left behind, but that gave Putin the power to go in because he saw the incompetence of our withdrawal from Afghanistan. We were going to get out, but we should have kept Bagram. It's one of the biggest air bases in the world. We built it many years ago, many, many years ago. Cost billions and billions of dollars. One hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons. And you know who's occupying it right now? China is occupying it right now. Under the Trump administration, we will restore peace through strength. That's what we had [cheers and applause]. That's what we had. Don't forget I didn't have any wars. I defeated ISIS 100%. It was supposed to take, it was supposed to take 4 years. It took 4 weeks, 4 weeks, right? General 'raising cane'. Right? Raising cane. But we defeated them very quickly. We will bring back law and order to our country. I will direct a completely overhaul DOJ to investigate every radical out of control prosecutor in America for their illegal, racist and reverse enforcement of the law [cheers and applause]. How is, how is Fani doing in the– how is, how is she doing in Fulton County, Atlanta? How's that? How's that trial? No, I paid him cash. I paid him cash. I didn't take, I didn't take anything. I paid him cash. Ohh, where'd you get the cash? They're not allowed to answer that question, they're not allowed to– I paid him cash, she said. I gave him cash, ohh, I didn't take anything. No, no. Every time we went on a trip– took nine trips in one year. That's a lot of trips. I haven't taken a trip; I don't think I've taken a trip for about 30 years actually. I don't take too many trips. But it's like, I think she said nine trips. Every time I took a trip with my lover, I paid, I paid him in cash. Where the hell did you get the cash? You know. What a lot of, what a lot of bullshit [cheers and applause]. And they hurt a lot of people. She wanted to indict U.S. senators. You know, they stopped at like, 40 people, but a lot of good people have been really devastated by the incompetence of that whole thing. And Georgia has been so badly hurt as a state, you know, it's been an embarrassment for Georgia. But when you watch that trial, it's so sad. I paid him in cash. I gave him cash every single trip. I took a lot of trips though, beautiful trips. Norwegian Cruise Lines, beautiful trips. It's so nice. Love is such a beautiful– isn't love a beautiful– love is such a beautiful thing. I'm also going to indemnify all police officers and law enforcement officials throughout the United States to protect them from being destroyed by the radical left people in office that want them to be hurt, that don't want them to look for crime and stop crime. They can stop crime so fast, but they're told not to. They're told to stand away as people walk out with television sets out of department stores that end up going out of business. And we're going to protect those officers and those precincts and, in some cases, the states [cheers and applause]. Because you can stop that whole phenomenon where they walk into a– 300 guys run into a department store and they loot it and it's like literally there's not a thing on the shelves. They take millions and millions of dollars out, and inevitably they close the stores, they're closing stores all over the country. You can stop that in one day, in one hour, if you got really nasty and really tough. Once they see things happening that they never thought were going to happen to them, and I mean tough, it'll all stop overnight. There won't be any more– and your police would love to be the ones that do it, but they're not allowed. They don't want to lose their homes and their families. They don't want to lose their pensions. We're going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety and beauty better than they've ever been before. We'll have to work with Democrats because every single one of our rotten cities are being run by the Democrats. So, we'll work with the Democrats if we have to. I think that's OK. We'll be bipartisan for a change. We will take over the horribly run capital of our nation, Washington DC, and clean it up, renovate it and rebuild our capital city so that it's no longer a nightmare of murder and crime. Two people killed over the last couple of days. People are being killed every week. People are being killed. They go from Michigan. They want to see– oh, let's go see the Jefferson memorial. They want to change the name, you know, because of different things. They want to change the name. They want to change the name of Washington, off everything they want– when you get down to George Washington can no longer be on high schools, where they're taking the name George Washington, then we better put on the brakes in this country, 'cuz we're gonna have a lot of big problems. But rather, it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world. I drive through– you know I have to go to court in Washington because it's all Biden people that do this. This is all election interference. And in Washington, you know, you have very liberal courts and you have very liberal everything. So, they get you in areas where in theory you can't win. But it's easier when you've done absolutely nothing wrong, but that doesn't matter, because all you have to do is look at Engoron. In theory you can't win. But I happen to go to court the other day and I'm driving through Washington, I say, man, this is going down so fast. Tents all over the place. The worst is the roads. They're in such bad condition. The medians are in such bad– you know the railings such bad–they, they warp. They're the worst garbage. I don't know who the hell they've been selling them for 30 years. They're such garbage. But they're falling down into the road. The roads are bad, there are potholes all over the place. And I'm saying to myself, can you imagine foreign dignitaries, foreign leaders coming into this country, and they go into Washington, DC and they see roads where there's– you're driving over garbage that's been there for three months, been there for a long time, been there for a long time. We have some really bad people in our country that are doing a terrible job. We're gonna change Washington, DC. We're gonna make it the safest place anywhere that you can be. Anywhere. A man who worked for me, who was fantastic, a young man that worked for me was shot the other night in his head. A carjacking, a carjacking. They shot him. They said we want your car, and they shot him in front of his wife. And he died. He died a week ago. What a sad thing. We're not gonna have that in Washington, DC. We're gonna run it properly, not run by these people that are just horrible, they're just horrible. It's so dangerous. You can't go to Washington, DC to go in a park anymore because you're gonna be mugged or shot. We're gonna change it. We're gonna bring it back. We're gonna beautify it. We're gonna take very strong measures on crime because we can't let that happen. The great capital, Washington, DC, is under siege. I will always defend Medicare and Social Security [cheers and applause], unlike 'Bird brain', and unlike frankly a lot of other people. Remember that, though, because they're not gonna defend it. You know, Nikki Haley, have you ever heard of her? You don't hear her name too much anymore. But, she wants to extend the minimum age of Social Security by 10 years, so supposing you're just about ready to get your Social Security and they say, darling, I have a little bad news, Nikki Haley just extended it by 10 years. I don't think you're going to be too happy. You know, we have such great wealth in this country, we don't have to play around with Social Security and Medicare. On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school, remember this, any school pushing critical race theory [cheers and applause]. It's so bad. It's so bad. Transgender insanity or any other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content onto the heads of our children. I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate [cheers and applause]. And maybe the easiest thing of all, it's embarrassing to have to say it because I don't think 10 years ago anybody ever heard of it, I will keep men out of women's sports [inaudible]. The weightlifting. The weightlifting. A record was set the other day in weightlifting that will never be broken by a woman, I can tell you. I will fully uphold our totally under siege Second Amendment, as I did for four years [cheers and applause]. We will protect innocent life and we will restore free speech and I will secure our elections where the goal will be one-day voting with paper ballots and voter ID [cheers and applause]. One day voting. And you can do that for 9% of the cost. CROWD: [chanting] TRUMP. TRUMP. TRUMP. TRUMP. TRUMP. TRUMP. TRUMP. TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. You know you could do the paper ballots and they, you know, paper, it sounds a little crazy, but paper, it called watermark, they have such secure paper now. It's, it's actually a very complex instrument. But the paper today is incredible. And you can do paper ballots, same day voting, think of it, you can do– and voter ID, it costs you 9% of what this other stuff that they do is. They have all the stuff, and they say we should be able to know the final count in two weeks from now. You ever see where they need two weeks to count with the paper ballots? You know, France did it because they couldn't do mail-in ballots, 'cuz they turned out to be totally corrupt. Mail-in voting is totally corrupt [cheers and applause]. Get that through your head. It has to be. The votes– I mean it has to be. And in France they did mail-in voting, and they gave it up because it was so corrupt. They went to paper ballots, same day voting, voter ID. They had 36 million votes. By 10:00 in the evening, everything was done. They had a winner, [Emmanuel] Macron. They had a loser. Went home and they started working the next day. And there was no complaints and there was no problems and there was no anything going through the air. There was nothing. They had same day vote and voter ID. They want paper, paper, highly sophisticated paper. Nine percent. You'll save a fortune. Nine percent. And you'll have your answer by 10:00 in the evening. But until then, Republicans must win. If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States and added them up, they would not have done near the destruction to our country as Joe Biden, 'Crooked' Joe, and the Biden administration have done. If you want to save America, then you must vote. You must go and vote. Remember, the primary is Tuesday, February 27th. We need you to get out and vote to set the stage for November 5th [cheers and applause]. Go vote. November 27th. So, remember, this, a date that's very important. It's November 5. November 5th. That's a very important date. Everything in our lives should be aimed to that date, because that's the date we're gonna make our country great again [cheers and applause]. 'Cuz right now we're a laughingstock all over the world. So, in two weeks, get out and vote. You watch, watch South Carolina how we're doing there. We're doing great. We're up about 30 or 35 points on, on a governor who was not really very popular. And in conclusion, from Marquette to Midland, from Grand Rapids to Detroit, we gotta watch Detroit, we gotta watch Detroit boy, oh boy, oh boy. They had such horrible abuse. You know, they had more ballots, you know this. they had more ballots than they had voters. Do you know that? Gee, and they didn't want to, you know, go into that. And from Warren to Waterford Township, Waterford Township, beautiful. We stand on the shoulders of red-blooded Michigan Patriots who laid the railroads, worked the factories, tilled the fields, forged the steel, fought the battles, and won the victories that built the Motor City and made America into the greatest and most powerful nation anywhere in the world [cheers and applause]. But now, but now we are a nation in decline. Very sad. We are a nation in decline. We're a failing nation. We're a nation that has lost its confidence, willpower and strength. We're a nation that has lost its way. But we are not going to allow this horror to continue. We're not going to allow it. And remember, Michigan, if we win Michigan, we win the whole ball game, we win everything [cheers and applause]. Nothing they'll be able to do. Don't let 'em cheat. Don't let 'em cheat. Three years ago, we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again. It was hard-working patriots like you, you are patriots, I mean, here it is, you're freezing your ass off, right? [cheers and applause]. And we're here. But it's warm because there's love in this room, right? [cheers and applause]. There's love. Hard-working patriots like you, who built this country, and it's hard-working patriots like you who are going to save our country. We will fight for America like no one has ever fought before [cheers and applause]. We have no choice. 2024 is our final battle. With you at my side we will demolish the deep state. We will expel the warmongers from our government. We will drive out the globalists. We will cast out the Communists, Marxists, and fascists [cheers and applause]. We will throw off the sick political class that hates our country, they truly do. They hate our country. We will route the fake news media. We will evict 'Crooked' Joe Biden from the White House on November 5th, 2024, please remember that day [cheers and applause]. That's our day. The great silent majority is rising like never before, and under our leadership, the forgotten man and woman will be forgotten no longer. We are one movement, you know we're the greatest movement in the history of our country. Make America Great Again. When Biden says, ohh, we have to stop MAGA, MAGA. I'd like to say, do you know what MAGA stands for? He would have no idea. MAGA? I don't know, that's not a fair question. And then the anchors would protect them. You shouldn't ask them a question like that. No, no. I'd say, do you know what MAGA stands for? No, please tell me. Make America Great Again. That's what it says [cheers and applause]. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God, and together we will make America powerful again [cheers and applause]. We will make America wealthy again [cheers and applause]. We will make America strong again [cheers and applause]. We will make America proud again [cheers and applause]. We will make America safe again [cheers and applause]. And we will make America great again [cheers and applause]. Thank you very much Michigan [cheers and applause]. Thank you. Get out and vote. God bless you all. God bless you. Thank you, everybody.",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370319",3407,"SAN ANTONIO, Texas – Tonight, Nikki Haley joined CNN's Kaitlan Collins to discuss Donald Trump's weakness on Russia.   Trump's weakness on Russia… ""Absolutely. I mean, all you have to do is look at his track record. I mean, this is a man who's known to kill his political opponents. We saw him do this with the Skripals in the United Kingdom a few years back when I was at the United Nations. And honestly Kaitlan, that's what was so disturbing about what Donald Trump said in his rally in Conway, South Carolina a week ago, was that he said that he would side with Putin and not defend NATO allies if they weren't pulling their weight. But he went even further than that, and he said that he would encourage Putin to invade any countries not pulling their weight. That means Donald Trump is siding with a thug. Who kills his political opponents. He's siding with someone who has made no bones about wanting to destroy America. He's siding with someone who arrests American journalists and holds them hostage. And he's siding with a dictator instead of siding with our allies who stood with us at 9/11. That's the problem. But this is exactly the Russia I know. I dealt with them every day at the United Nations. It is a brutal dictatorship. Navalny was a hero. He was trying to call out corruption. He was trying to call out what Putin did. The fact that he returned back to Russia was nothing short of just amazingly courageous. But he was trying to make a point. And what Putin was doing was trying to make a point in front of the next Russian elections to everybody not to speak up against him. It's a sad day."" Trump's refusal to call out dictators… ""The problem is anybody that can't call out a dictator, that's a problem. He should be calling, not just calling Putin out for what happened to Navalny, he should be calling Putin out for the fact that he's got Evan Gershkovich as a hostage. He should be calling Putin out for invading Ukraine. He should be calling Putin out for the fact that now they are surrounding the Baltics and Putin's getting ready for his next act. When he said that that day, it emboldened Putin. And what we're seeing is Putin's emboldened by Biden because he senses weakness, he doesn't see any sort of resistance and that's why he invaded Ukraine. And he's emboldened by Trump because Trump is not willing to stand up for our allies. Both of those are dangerous. And I can promise you this, Putin would not be doing that if I were president."" On Trump making the RNC his ""piggy bank"" for his legal fees… ""I don't want the RNC to become his legal defense fund. I don't want the RNC to become his piggy bank for his personal court cases. We've already seen him spend $50 million worth of campaign contributions towards his personal court cases. Now we see him trying to get control of the RNC, so that he can continue not to have to pay his own legal fees. The problem is that doesn't help us win any seats in the House, in the Senate, or anything else if the RNC is all focused on his legal fees… I am most concerned about is now he's gone and taken someone from North Carolina. He's made the co-chair his daughter-in-law. He's made his campaign manager the director of operations. He's trying to control the RNC after the fact that he tried to get me out of the race so that he could be the presumptive nominee. All of that is so that he has an arm to pay his legal fees.""","","",""

The Two Should Debate Their Differences Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370273",1718,"By: Michael StrainOnline here Nikki Haley announced a major policy position: She supports seizing Russia's frozen central-bank assets and using them to reconstruct Ukraine. While former president Donald Trump is siding with Russia, Haley is siding with Ukraine and Western allies. While Trump is tearing down global security, Haley wants to prop it up. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Western governments froze some $300 billion of the assets of Russia's central bank held in Western accounts. Late last month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 20 to one in favor of the unprecedented act of seizing those frozen assets and using them to rebuild Ukraine. Haley supports this legislation. In a statement to Bloomberg, Haley said: ""Just in the past few days, Trump sided with Putin over NATO, and his willingness to abandon Ukraine and our allies puts every American in danger. Our focus must always be about preventing war and keeping our troops out of harm's way."" Haley added: ""We need a president who has moral clarity about the need to support our allies and stand up to the world's worst dictators."" Seizing Russia's frozen assets would be risky and controversial. Haley has come down on the right side of this issue. If Trump disagrees with her, then he should get on a debate stage with her and explain why. We are living in dangerous times. There are land wars in Europe and in the Middle East. Tensions are rising in East Asia. Trump and Haley have deep, fundamental disagreements about whether the United States should support dictators or democracies. Trump should be asked this question every day: Why won't you debate Nikki Haley about the crucial issues facing our nation and the world?","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370286",4754,"CHARLESTON, S.C. — Donald Trump talks a lot about his South Carolina poll numbers, but his actions say something else. If he's doing so well, why is he taking the money he desperately needs to pay his legal bills and using it to run false ads against Nikki Haley? Narrator: He's scared. It gets worse. Under Trump's do-nothing plan, Social Security will start running out of money in 2033 and will require a 23% cut in benefits to keep it afloat. Nikki Haley has always spoken hard truths. She has a plan to save Social Security and Medicare without taking away anything from people nearing or in retirement. ""Donald Trump is a hypocrite, but that's not even the worst part,"" said Haley communications director Nachama Soloveichik. ""His craven, do-nothing plan will torpedo Social Security in just a few years. For all his false bravado, Donald Trump is too afraid to tell Americans the truth and still afraid of Nikki Haley's momentum."" DONALD TRUMP Trump himself is on the record acknowledging Social Security's fiscal crisis and calling for increasing the retirement age.  In his 2000 book, The America We Deserve, Trump wrote, ""If you're a young person, you would definitely do better to believe in the X-Files than to count on getting your full Social Security benefit.""   Trump called Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme,"" and suggested solutions ranging from privatizing Social Security to raising ""the age for receipt of full Social Security to 70.""   He defends raising the retirement age: ""A firm limit at age 70 makes sense now for people under 40. We're living longer. We're working longer. New medicines are extending healthy human life.""   In 2020, Trump proposed cutting Medicare to deal with the growing debt crisis (that he helped create).  What do the fact checkers say? Trump is lying.  PolitiFact: ""The Trump ad is an extreme exaggeration of how many Americans would be affected by Haley's plans for Social Security. It would not affect retirees or people nearing retirement.The ad's 82% appears to refer to a rough estimate of the total Americans eligible for Social Security benefits. Haley has never advocated cutting all Social Security benefits for everyone currently in that 82%.""   WRAL: ""Is that right? No. Haley has never said she wants to cut Social Security for 82% of Americans. She does want to tie the retirement age to the U.S. life expectancy, which is going up, but she only wants to do this for people who are currently in their 20s. She said this for a while now, including in that TV interview that Trump showed in that attack ad. Trump's campaign edited out that part though.""   FactCheck.org: ""Trump wrongly claimed Haley wants to raise the Social Security retirement age by 10 to 12 years, even for people currently 'in their 60s or 70s.' Haley has advocated raising the retirement age, but only for people now in their 20s… In his 2000 book 'The America We Deserve,' Trump proposed raising the Social Security retirement age to 70.""  NIKKI HALEY Haley has a plan for reforming Social Security and Medicare that does NOT take away from people nearing or in retirement:  Raise the retirement age for younger generations in their twenties and index Social Security and Medicare benefits to life expectancy.   Limit the growth of benefits for higher-income beneficiaries.   Expand Medicare Advantage and increase competition.   Match cost-of-living increases for Social Security to actual inflation rates by using chained CPI.  Praise for Haley's honest talk about Social Security and Medicare:  Wall Street Journal editorial board: ""Few politicians are willing to touch entitlements these days, but Nikki Haley dared to do so in the recent debate on Medicare. A new study shows her pitch to expand the Medicare Advantage program could lower costs and improve care.""   Quin Hillyer, Washington Examiner: ""Haley, alone among the serious Republican contenders for the presidency, has had the guts to tell the truth that the Social Security system faces insolvency within nine years… It then takes real gall for Trump and his campaign team to ape Democratic attacks saying that Haley advocates 'gutting Social Security.'""   Tiana Lowe Doescher, Washington Examiner: ""Nikki Haley is correct: Refusing to touch Social Security means a 23% benefit cut""   S.E. Cupp, CNN: ""She gave some tough talk to her own party on entitlement reform for example.… I thought all of that was pretty refreshing.""   Kelly Sadler, Newsmax: ""So far Nikki Haley has been the only one who has addressed it on the campaign trail, saying that she would like 20-year-olds who are not bought into the program yet to be paying a little bit more or trying to alter the program so it is solvent for the 20-year-olds who are just entering the workplace.""","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370271",3796,"By: Ralph NormanOnline here Donald Trump likes to say he will ""drain the swamp."" That was a winning message in 2016, when he was the quintessential outsider. Fast forward eight years … and the outsider has become the insider. When Trump left the White House, the D.C. swamp was alive and growing — just like our country's federal debt, which grew by a stunning $8 trillion under Trump. Now, the same people Trump once rejected — the political class in D.C. — are flocking to him in a show of establishment support. If Republican primary voters want someone who will truly shake up Washington, they have a better choice. In South Carolina politics, no one has been more anti-establishment than Nikki Haley. She has been a thorn in the side of the establishment from the moment she decided to challenge the longest-serving state representative in the Legislature. In 2004, challenges to entrenched incumbents were uncommon, and Haley's primary opponent was a 30-year incumbent of the S.C. House. How dare she challenge him? She dared, and she won. Some candidates go to Columbia and quickly become one of the crowd. Not Haley. When she realized South Carolina's Legislature didn't take recorded votes on every bill, she changed things. When elected politicians tried hiding their votes from the people who pay their salaries, Haley launched a campaign to put legislative votes on the record. Republican leadership didn't like it, and when she refused to back down, they punished her by stripping away her leadership position on key committees. Haley took her case to the people of South Carolina. In May 2009, Haley launched her gubernatorial campaign on this issue. She ran against better-known and better-funded candidates. She was too conservative, too ambitious, too young. How dare she challenge South Carolina's established political order? She dared, and she won. One of Haley's first acts as governor was to sign the transparency legislation she pushed for as a legislator, declaring, ""This is about accountability in South Carolina … because elected officials work for the people and not the other way around."" During her six years as governor, Haley fought both Democrats and Republicans on behalf of taxpayers. When the establishment fought for a gas tax increase, she killed it. When legislators voted for higher spending, she published legislative report cards on her Facebook page and called them out. She vetoed $459 million in wasteful spending. And she pushed the Legislature to pass much-needed ethics reform. Haley took her characteristic toughness to the United Nations and the U.S. State Department — two institutions that are allergic to change and disruption. She not only took on America's enemies, she took on the foreign policy establishment at the State Department that wanted to maintain the status quo at all costs. How dare an outsider like Haley rock the boat? She dared, and she won. Today, as a presidential candidate, she stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who rubber-stamped massive increases in federal spending. She regularly criticizes both Democrats and Republicans for the runaway spending that led to the highest inflation in 40 years. She has repeatedly criticized the D.C. bailouts — from the bank bailouts to the COVID bailouts. She routinely calls for term limits and mental competency tests for politicians as well as term limits for federal bureaucrats. Nikki Haley is the anti-establishment candidate taking on the D.C. insiders who have rallied around Donald Trump. She is the candidate who will take on both Democrats and Republicans. She will always put the American people first. After all, she's been doing it since she toppled a 30-year incumbent Republican years ago.

""The men and women that I serve with – the men and women that I know, and the family members that I know – serve their country and will do it whether they are hurt, whether they are hurting… it does not matter, because they place service, freedom, and liberty above anything else.""

Watch the full press conference here.   General Bolduc on Major Michael Haley's service… ""I know [Maj. Haley] is in a combat zone and hostile fire zone because that is what I worked so hard to get East Africa recognized as. I had service members wounded there. And a lot of Americans don't realize that in Africa, we have our service members serving in harm's way, just like we did in Afghanistan and Iraq and many other places. And so Michael is there doing his job for his country. And the comments that President Trump made about Michael's service, knowing full well where Michael was and trying to attribute that to some other characterization is absolutely disgraceful."" General Bolduc on Donald Trump's history of insulting service members… ""But we also know that's not the first time that Donald Trump has done this. He's done it to Senator McCain, who in his service he became a POW, and President Trump made disparaging comments about that. That was absolutely wrong. And then we know he made terrible comments about the Marines in Belleau Woods, and that he refused to go out and recognize the sacrifice of Americans in France at cemeteries. And that was absolutely wrong…And then we have Donald Trump making disparaging comments and not fully understanding the sacrifice of Sergeant Johnson during the Niger ambush. And that's absolutely wrong. ""And then wondering why wounded warriors are out in Arlington Cemetery. Well, I'll tell you why they're out there, Mr. Trump. They're out there because they're honoring the service members that they served with that didn't make it back. And they're out there missing their arms and their legs and eyes and so on and so forth because they left something on a battlefield, their flesh, their blood, their comrades. That's what they're out there for, Mr. Former President."" General Bolduc on military families… ""What [Donald Trump says] about veterans, what you say about service members, what you said about Nikki Haley, what you said about her husband Michael, hurts. To my wife, Sharon, who is a veteran, and she was by my side from 1989 when I commissioned as a second lieutenant – we were married shortly after that – all the way up to my retirement in 2017. And she was at home while I was deployed on 10 tours, going to the memorial ceremonies, personally consoling the family members. And to disparage [military families], to say anything negative about them is absolutely wrong.""  General Bolduc on what's at stake in the primary election… ""Biden is not an option, and Trump is not an option. They're too divisive, they have grievances, they will tear this country apart from within…This is serious business. The security of our country. And a President of the United States that can't honor its fallen and those that have served is someone who should not be President of the United States. ""I ask the Republicans, the Independents and the Democrats that are eligible to vote in the primary coming up here in South Carolina, that they do a lot of soul-searching. Do you want someone who has honor and integrity and has served your state well and did a great job by the people here? And then went off to the UN and did a great job and took the 'kick me' sign off of America, and held China, Russia, North Korea, Iran to a standard and who knows the sacrifices of our service members and knows what it means to be Commander-in-Chief?

(WBTW) — Former President Donald Trump's 'Get Out the Vote' rally Saturday afternoon at Coastal Carolina University left some people offended, including Myrtle Beach Mayor Brenda Bethune. Some of his strongest comments were about Republican presidential rival Nikki Haley's husband. Michael Haley is currently deployed with the Army National Guard in Africa. ""Where's her husband?"" Trump asked. ""He's away. What happened to her husband? What happened to her husband? Where is he? He's gone. He knew."" Bethune, a Haley supporter who introduced her at a January rally at CCU, said Trump's comments prove that he's not supportive of the military. ""I think we all expected Trump to come to this area at some point, but I don't think the rally helped him at all,"" Bethune said. ""Actually, I think it hurt him by some of the infuriating comments he made.

""Not saying they were there to support candidate Trump, but the fact that they took the time to go listen for themselves."" Bethune said she thinks Trump's campaign tactics will not change.

Dear Donald Trump: At a campaign rally in Conway, S.C., you attacked Nikki Haley's husband, Major Michael Haley, who is currently deployed with the Army National Guard. This is Michael Haley's second deployment, having previously served in Afghanistan. You said: ""Where's her husband? Oh, he's away. He's away! What happened to her husband?

We have not forgotten that you called more than 1,800 U.S. Marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood ""losers"" and ""suckers"" while you were president.

On Trump's mockery of the military…  ""It's disgusting. And let's take me and Michael out of it. If you're going to go and criticize a combat veteran, you criticize one veteran, you're criticizing all of them. But this continues to be a pattern of what he's doing. Whether he's sitting there calling them 'suckers,' whether he's in Arlington Cemetery saying 'why would they do this?' not understanding that no, my husband is not with me in a presidential campaign because he's serving our country. I'm incredibly proud of him and every man and woman that serves for our country and are willing to shed blood for our country. But the idea that he thinks that you can talk about this so carelessly is a problem. Because if you don't understand that it's their shoulders we stand on, if you don't understand that everybody knows someone who has either lost their life or served this country in a way that's allowed us to keep our freedoms, that is not someone who deserves to be commander-in-chief."" On Americans being tired of the same old politicians…  ""The majority of Americans don't want Biden. And now you have 59% of Americans who have said that Trump and Biden are too old. At what point are we going to say we need a new generational leader? At what point are we going to look at Congress and say maybe they need to leave their power and turn it over to a younger generation of people? Because what you've seen out of Biden and Trump, all they're doing is talking about themselves. We saw Biden. The special counsel says that he, you know, is mentally deficient. He comes out, he gives a press conference, he's angry, and then he gets some things wrong again. But then we see Trump. He goes out and he does a rally, goes two minutes off the prompter, and he's completely unhinged. My question is, when we have a country in disarray and a world on fire, why are we really going to let it come down to two 80-year-olds running for president, when we need someone who can serve eight years, fully disciplined, fully willing to work to get our country back on track? It's a wake-up call for everybody."" On NATO's success story… ""First of all, in the administration, he talked many times about getting out of NATO behind closed doors and publicly, that's just a fact. But the idea that he would side with a thug, the idea that Trump is saying that not only is he not going to defend our allies who were with us after 9/11, by the way. That he's also going to tell Putin to go ahead and encourage him to invade them is unthinkable. The idea that he is siding with a man who kills his opponents. The idea that he's siding with Putin, who's holding Evan Gershkovich just for doing his job. The idea that he would side with a man who has made it very clear that he wants to defeat America. One, personally, as the wife of a combat veteran, that's the last thing you want to hear from someone who wants to be commander-in-chief, because that means he's not going to watch out for the men and women in the military. Secondly, that means he's not going to watch out for our friends. Do the NATO countries need to pay more? Yes, we should always push them to carry their weight. But at the same time, understand NATO is a success story.""","","",""

Overwhelming majority of Americans think Biden is too old for another term: POLL A majority also think Trump is too old for a second term. By Meredith DelisoOnline Here An overwhelming majority of Americans think President Joe Biden is too old to serve another term, according to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll. According to the poll, conducted using Ipsos' Knowledge Panel, 86% of Americans think Biden, 81, is too old to serve another term as president. That figure includes 59% of Americans who think both he and former President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, are too old and 27% who think only Biden is too old. Sixty-two percent of Americans think Trump, who is 77, is too old to serve as president. There is a large difference in how partisans view their respective nominees -- 73% of Democrats think Biden is too old to serve but only 35% of Republicans think Trump is too old to serve.?Ninety-one percent of independents think Biden is too old to serve, and 71% say the same about Trump. Concerns about both candidates' ages have increased since September when an ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 74% of Americans thought Biden -- the oldest commander in chief in U.S. history -- was too old to serve another term as president, and 49% said the same about Trump. The new poll comes on the heels of last week's report from special counsel Robert Hur, which recommended that Biden should not face charges over his handling of classified documents while out of office but did cast doubt on his mental fitness. Vice President Kamala Harris called the report ""politically motivated."" With the report on Biden's handling of classified documents just being released this past Thursday, 38% of Americans think Biden should have been charged with a crime, while 34% say he should not have been and another 28% are undecided, according to the poll. There are clear divides by party :68% of Democrats say he shouldn't have been charged while 73% of Republicans say he should have been. Trump has been indicted on federal charges in relation to his handling of classified information while out of office -- one of four indictments the former president currently faces while campaigning for reelection. He denies all wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty. A June 2023 ABC News/Ipsos poll found that more Americans thought Trump should have been charged with a crime for his handling of classified documents, 48%, whereas 35% thought he should not have been and 17% said they did not know. Hur highlighted the differences between the two cases in his report, noting that Trump allegedly refused to return the documents for several months, despite being given multiple chances, and ""obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it."" ""In contrast,"" the report said, ""Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice, consented to the search of multiple locations including his homes, sat for a voluntary interview and in other ways cooperated with the investigation."" Despite these distinctions, when asked who they trust to do a better job of handling classified documents, more Americans said neither (41%), followed by Biden (33%) and then Trump (23%). Amid Trump's legal battles, an overwhelming number of Americans (66%) think the former president should not be immune to criminal prosecution for actions he took while president, according to the poll. That includes 45% of Republicans and 83% of Democrats.?Independents fall in between at 66%. The poll also comes days after the Senate failed to advance a bipartisan foreign aid bill with major new border provisions. Americans find there is blame to go around on Congress' failure to pass legislation intended to decrease the number of illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border -- with about the same number blaming the Republicans in Congress (53%), the Democrats (51%) and Biden (49%). Fewer, 39%, blame Trump. More Americans trust that Trump would do a better job of handling immigration and the situation at the border than Biden -- 44%-26% -- according to the poll. More Americans also trust Trump over Biden on the handling of crime (41%-28%), the economy (43%-31%) and inflation (41%-31%). On another key issue, Biden has an edge when it comes to abortion, with 37% of Americans saying they trust he would do a better job versus 28% saying Trump. More Americans also trust Biden more on health care (38%-28%) and climate change (39%-22%) than Trump.","","",""

By: Maggie AstorOnline here Nikki Haley condemned former President Donald J. Trump on Sunday for suggesting that he might not defend NATO allies, and that he might even encourage Russia to attack them, if re-elected. ""Don't take the side of a thug who kills his opponents,"" Ms. Haley said on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ""Don't take the side of someone who has gone in and invaded a country, and half a million people have died or been wounded because of Putin. Don't take the side of someone who continues to lie. I dealt with Russia every day. The last thing we ever want to do is side with Russia."" Ms. Haley was responding to comments Mr. Trump made at a rally on Saturday night, when he recounted a conversation with a foreign leader during his presidency in which he said he might not defend a NATO country against a Russian attack if the country were ""delinquent"" on funding to the alliance. ""No, I would not protect you,"" Mr. Trump said he replied. ""In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want."" Though there were disputes during Mr. Trump's administration over some European countries' spending commitments to their own militaries, there was no debt owed to the alliance. When the CBS show's host, Margaret Brennan, asked whether Ms. Haley would ""adhere to the premise that an attack on one is an attack on all"" if elected president, Ms. Haley said, ""Absolutely."" ""We do want NATO allies to pull their weight, but there are ways you can do that without sitting there and telling Russia, 'Have your way with these countries,'"" she said. ""If you notice, Russia has never invaded a NATO country. They've invaded Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. They are actually very intimidated by NATO. NATO allows us to prevent war."" In his rally on Saturday, Mr. Trump also insulted Ms. Haley directly, suggesting that her husband, Michael Haley, a major in the Army National Guard who is deployed to Djibouti, had left the country to avoid being with her. ""This isn't personal about me and Michael,"" Ms. Haley said in the interview on Sunday. ""This is about what it says to every member who sacrifices for us. This is about what it says to every military family who sacrifices alongside of them. We can't have someone who sits there and mocks our men and women who are trying to protect America."" Ms. Brennan noted that, during his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump mocked Senator John McCain for having been a prisoner of war and insulted the parents of a soldier killed in combat, but Ms. Haley nonetheless agreed to work for him as ambassador to the United Nations. ""I agreed to serve our country, and I'm proud I got to serve our country,"" Ms. Haley replied. Mr. Trump's comments on NATO also drew condemnation on Sunday from former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who was the most outspoken Trump critic in the Republican primary until he ended his campaign last month. ""It's one thing, and I think it's right, for a president to say to a NATO member, 'Hey, you've got to pay the dues you need to pay,'"" Mr. Christie said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""But the problem with Donald Trump is he can't just stop there. He's got to say, 'I would encourage Russia to do whatever the hell they wanted to you.' That is absolutely inappropriate for a president of the United States or a candidate for president of the United States to be saying, but it is consistent with his love for dictators.""","","",""

That's right — just days after special counsel ROBERT HUR put Biden's mental faculties in the spotlight, Haley said Trump's Saturday tirade exposed his own delirious instincts.

Haley wants to save Social Security from going bankrupt by raising the retirement age for workers in their twenties. Donald Trump himself proposed raising the retirement age to 70.

Nearly all the reputable polls show Haley beating Biden by large margins while Donald Trump loses or barely squeaks by. A new poll from the well-respected Marquette University shows Nikki Haley stomping all over Joe Biden in the Wisconsin general election with 57 percent to Biden's 42 percent. A recent Marist poll shows Haley winning New Hampshire while Trump loses by seven points. The same is true for national polls, including the recent Quinnipiac, CNN, and NBC News polls. Lie #4: Trump claims Haley is good for China. Haley has proposed a comprehensive plan for tackling the China threat.

The billboard features a video called ""Grumpy Old Men Say What?"" reminding voters that both Joe Biden and Donald Trump can't meet the demands of the presidency. Watch here:   ""Are we running a country or a nursing home?"" said Haley communications director Nachama Soloveichik. ""Seventy percent of Americans don't want two Grumpy Old Men on the presidential ballot in November.

Nikki Haley responded: ""Michael is deployed serving our country, something you know nothing about. Someone who continually disrespects the sacrifices of military families has no business being commander in chief.""   Many others responded in kind. Here's what they are saying… Gen. Don Bolduc: Only a sick individual would put down a service member who is deployed. This disrespects every military family in our country. It's exactly the chaos we don't need in America. CNN's Jake Tapper: Maj. Michael Haley is a commissioned officer with the SC National Guard and is currently deployed with the 218th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade in the Horn of Africa. Ben Domenech: It's actually kind of amazing that not a single Trump family member has served in the military for 150 years. But it's true. Fox News' Guy Benson: Her husband is currently deployed abroad, serving in the United States Armed Forces. This is low, gratuitous and gross. Don't defend this. Jason Emert, military officer: Michael Haley is currently deployed with his unit. Never forget Trumps hates the military & values it as nothing more than a prop for him. He's always been a coward so he'll never understand the sacrifices made by both Maj. Haley as a soldier & @NikkiHaley as a military spouse. Alyssa Farah Griffin: @NikkiHaley's husband is currently deployed abroad serving our country in uniform — Something Donald Trump never did. What a sad old man. The Hudson Institute's Nate Sibley: Maj. Michael Haley, South Carolina Army National Guard, is currently honorably serving his country on a year-long deployment to the Horn of Africa—one of the most devastated regions on Earth. So, that's where Nikki Haley's husband is—you just have to google these things. Jason Church, veteran: Served west of me in Afghanistan. It was a bad year in Panjwai'i @jaketapper. There's a reason we don't talk about it. Major Haley is what every platoon leader wishes an S-3 would be. The right man for the job. CNN's Kaitlan Collins: Nikki Haley's husband is currently deployed. AG: 1) Haley's husband is deployed serving with the South Carolina National Guard overseas so an embarrassing cheap shot. 2) You would think Trump would be the last person to try to attack someone for having a spouse missing from the campaign trail right now… Bill McCoshen: This may be the lowest Trump has ever gone. Disgusting CNN's Kate Sullivan: Trump today on Nikki Haley's husband, who is currently deployed overseas with the National Guard: ""Where's her husband? Oh he's away. He's away. Where, what happened to her husband? What happened to her husband? Where is he? He's gone. He knew, he knew."" Peter Henlein, Iraq War veteran: What a sad, pathetic man. Trump's been basically abandoned by Melania. She wouldn't even share a car with him. But he's asking where Nikki Haley's husband is as an attack on her? He is deployed for the National Guard, it's not a secret. Dr. Jonathan Reiner: Amb Haley's husband is currently deployed in Africa. Donald Trump avoided the military because a podiatrist certified he had bone spurs. Jeffrey Evan Gold: Nikki Haley's husband is deployed in Africa with US Army National Guard, June 2023-June 2024. Surprised Trump didn't just call him a loser. Aaron Astor: Haley's husband is serving overseas in the military. Trump knows this. We're so jaded by this behavior but I guess it's useful to be reminded that Donald Trump is still the same dishonorable lowlife degenerate. Jamil N. Jaffer: Why is @GOP about to nominate someone who attacks the spouse of a GOP candidate for office while he is serving overseas in the @SCNationalGuard? This is not the Republican Party I joined + have worked for nearly every cycle since the late 90s. Shame on you @realDonaldTrump","","",""

[For months] I have always said that Joe Biden was not going to be president. You look at what's happened in the last couple of days, and you see exactly what I'm talking about. The fact that we're dealing with someone who the special counsel said that their memory was failing, that they are diminished…  It's bigger than just Joe Biden. You can look at the same thing: whether it's Donald Trump getting me confused with Nancy Pelosi, his temper tantrums, the things he's done.  It's time for a new generational leader. The party that dismisses their 80-year-old candidate is the party that will win the presidency, without a doubt. The Democrats are waking up to that now. You're going to see them make their moves.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370373",2990,"By: Natalie AllisonOnline here Nikki Haley is stepping up her attacks on Donald Trump's age — this time at his own rally in South Carolina. The Haley campaign on Saturday will parade a mobile billboard around the Myrtle Beach area, including by Trump's rally in Conway, where the former president will appear for the first time this year in the state ahead of South Carolina's Feb. 24 GOP presidential primary. Haley's latest trolling attempt, first confirmed to POLITICO, involves the campaign playing a video featuring clips of Trump and President Joe Biden trailing off and otherwise appearing confused during recent public remarks. That's after Haley declared on Friday that Biden, 81, and Trump, 77, would be using the White House as a ""taxpayer-subsidized nursing home,"" and that Trump is suffering from ""mental deficiencies."" The issue of candidates' age, long a feature of the presidential campaign, took on heightened significance when the special counsel investigating Biden's handling of classified documents issued his report on Thursday on the matter. While finding no criminal charges were warranted, the report presented a damaging portrait of Biden's mental acuity. Horry County, the site of Saturday's Trump rally, is a conservative stronghold where Trump won nearly half the vote in a still-crowded 2016 presidential primary — and some of the least fertile ground for Haley in this month's contest. Her campaign's decision to send a roving billboard truck into the heart of MAGA country underscores Haley's brash approach of rebuking Trump now that the race is a head-to-head match — and as she remains far behind. Trump celebrates Nevada win, mocks Haley's performance Her recent offensive against Trump, after months of offering only tepid criticism of the front-runner, comes as the former South Carolina governor trails Trump by a massive margin in her home state. Trump racked up top Republican endorsements early in the state and has kept a firm grip on the conservative base in South Carolina. Haley and her top campaign aides have said she plans to stay in the primary race for the long haul — regardless of her South Carolina performance — and that she has no reason to bow out before voters in Super Tuesday states cast ballots in early March. Since announcing her bid a year ago, Haley has called for a new, younger leader for the party and country. But she has ramped up her criticisms of Trump lately, including during a segment on ""Saturday Night Live"" last weekend. Trump has likewise gone after Haley, posting on Truth Social on Friday a 2012 video of Haley at a Mitt Romney rally mistakenly praising then-President Barack Obama, instead of Romney, and criticizing her for taking campaign money from Democratic donors. ""Donald may be suffering from memory issues,"" Haley, who is 52, posted in response, asking whether Trump forgot that he had donated to Democratic politicians. Haley on Saturday is embarking on a bus tour to stops in rural South Carolina.","","",""

I'm thrilled to be back with the hardworking American, God-fearing true American patriots of the NRA. [crowd cheering]. Right from the beginning, for four incredible years, it was my honor to be the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House by far. Now I stand before you with a very simple promise, your Second Amendment will always be safe with me as your president. When I'm back in the Oval Office no one will lay a finger on your firearms. It's not going to happen, and I want to thank some of the great members of Congress that are with us today, we appreciate it. Scott Perry. Brave man. Where is Scott? Where is Scott? He's fantastic. Thank you, Scott. Great job. Guy Reschenthaler. Guy Reshchenthaler. Where is Guy? He's here, I just saw him. There he is. [points to Guy in the crowd]. Thank you, Guy. Fantastic job. A good friend of mine, Dan Meuser. Dan, thank you. Dan. Thank you Dan very much. Great patriots, great people. Lloyd Schmucker. Thank you, Lloyd. Thanks very much. Great job too. These are very brave people. Also, Ambassador Carlos Sans who's done a fantastic job and a friend of mine. You wouldn't believe it; I met him when he worked at CNN. Can you believe it? [booing]. No, no he got out. He said I'm out of here. He said I'm out of here and he's an incredible writer. A great intellectual. Jeffrey Lord wherever you may be, Jeffrey, thank you. As many of you know, last night we had a monumental victory in Nevada. It was a big one. We won over 99% of the vote and got more votes than any candidate in the history of the Nevada caucus. Think of that. That's a nice win and we also won yesterday. A beautiful place I will tell you. But this is a beautiful place also—but we won the Virgin Islands. Got a 100%, we won it in a landslide. And three weeks ago, we all watched that it was 40° below zero. How about that. That's good you don't have weather like that. We have some lousy weather here too, but we don't have weather like that. Forty degrees. You couldn't walk from the car to a door which was like—there and you walked and you said I think I'm frozen. It was seriously cold 3 weeks ago, record-breaking margins. And we won, as you know, New Hampshire. We won Iowa. We won everything. In fact, when we went to Iowa, we won by the largest margin in the history of the Iowa caucus times two double the largest margin. Then we went to New Hampshire, and we had more votes than any candidate has ever gotten in the history of the New Hampshire primary. So, these are good signs. These are good signs and 15 days from now, we're going to win the South Carolina primary. We're way ahead but we only have a 42-point lead that's not—that's not bad. And this November we're going to win. Remember, this is the big one. The White House, we're going to win the White House. Starting with a historic triumph right here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We love Pennsylvania. I went to school in Pennsylvania. I went to school in Pennsylvania. I love Pennsylvania. We ran twice. We won Pennsylvania twice. We won it twice; we did much better the second time than we did the first time. It's interesting, isn't it? Four years ago, I told you what would happen if Joe Biden got into office. I said he would throw open our borders, destroy our middle class, crush American energy. We were energy independent 3 years ago, now we're asking Venezuela, can we have some of your oil please. He was going to empower America's enemies, unleash misery throughout your state and throughout our country bedlam and chaos at home and abroad. The only thing I didn't know is—I didn't know how bad it would be. It's even worse, everyone said I was exaggerating, but sadly as the now famous saying goes, Trump was right about everything. I was right about Joe Biden. Joe Biden is the worst and most incompetent and most corrupt president in the history of our country. And today I issue another warning. If crooked Joe gets four more years, his second term will make his first term look like paradise. We're not going to have a country left anymore. We're not going to let it happen. We can never ever let that happen. The stampede of illegal aliens across our borders will surge into the tens of millions. I hate to tell you we're already there. I believe that you'll have 19 million people have come into our country illegally by the end of his term. Nineteen. It's bigger than New York State and the people that will benefit the least, the biggest losers in this whole invasion, will be African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and all unions. Unions will be out of business. I met with uh teamsters the other day. Had a good meeting with the teamsters and I said you better get me because we're going to stop—we're going to close up our borders. We had the safest borders in the history of our country and now we have the worst. Hourly wages will be cut in half if Biden's policies are allowed to continue. Open borders. He wants open borders. Nobody thought they were—nobody thought they were real. When they say open border, they come in from prisons all over the world, from mental institutions all over the world. They're terrorists. What we've taken into our country by the millions and we're going to end it on day one. We end it on day— [applause] one. Our cities have already become hell holes with carjackings, lootings, muggings, and murder spilling deep into the suburbs. The other day, one of the great, great people who worked for me in the White House, an executive brilliant young person was carjacked and shot in the head and killed. And this is in Washington D.C.--it took place. He was picking up his wife. Incredible couple. Beautiful couple with children, beautiful children, and a thug came up put a gun to his head and killed him for no reason whatsoever. Just killed him. Our currency will be trashed. Our middle class will be thrown into servitude and poverty; this is what's happening already. You see it's happening; you take a look at your cities. Your cities are going to hell. You take a look at what's going on, they're filthy, dirty, they're crime ridden. People walk down the street, they get shot, they get mugged. We're really likely to face a uh I say 100% chance of a terrorist attack. You know in 2019 and I didn't even believe this number but the fake news—that's a lot of fake news. Look at that, it's a lot of fake news. I didn't believe this number but they had up that in 2019—that's my time. There were no terrorists. You know we had all sorts of bans. We had it down. We really had it down. Not one terrorist that they have at least on record, sure it can't be exactly correct, but not one terrorist was reported. Now if you look at your numbers, more than we've ever taken are pouring into our country from all over the world, from countries that many of you have never even heard of. They're pouring into our country and an entire generation of young people could very well be decimated by something that could very well happen. World War II. And it'll never happen with me. I can tell you that it will never happen with me. Never. If you care about your country, if you care about your children, then this November you have to fire—remember The Apprentice? You're fired, you're fired. Some people say that's how I became president. I don't know if that's true or not, that was quite something. But you have to fire crooked Joe Biden and we have to do votes like you've never seen before. They cheat like hell. We have to—we have to just swamp them. We're going to swamp them. They're not going to be able to cheat their way out of it. No think of it, who can get elected with high interest rates, open borders, food that costs 40 50 60% more than it did just a few years ago? Your lifestyles have changed. Who could get elected with this stuff? A woke military. We have a great military. I rebuilt the entire military. And how about Afghanistan? The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, which is why Putin probably looked at that—he saw incompetence all over that. Was a surrender I guess. And we had it—not in 18 months. We didn't have one person shot or killed in Afghanistan. Not one person and then this guy comes in and he takes the soldiers out first. Okay a child, I could take that beautiful child at the third row, I see a beautiful child, like probably 10 or 11 say. Would you move the soldiers out first or last and he'd look at me and say I think we'll do it last. They took the soldiers out and then uh supposed to take them out last. You take all the equipment, you take all the people. We had 13 incredible soldiers, I've gotten to know their families, killed. These are unbelievable young people. The families are unbelievable. Actually they've come over to Bedminster and different places and we love them but 13 killed so unnecessarily. We had—we left behind $85 billion dollar worth of equipment. You know, Afghanistan now is one of the largest sellers of military equipment in the world. They're selling our beautiful, brand-new equipment. We left hundreds of people behind, including others that we could have taken, but we left hundreds of Americans behind. They're still there and I think when Putin and President Xi of China—when they look at this all, of a sudden President Xi starts thinking in terms of Taiwan. He's certainly thinking a lot about it. They weren't thinking about it four years ago and Putin was always the apple of his eye. But he would have never done it. He would have never done it and he went into—he went into a place that's so beautiful and it's not so beautiful anymore. He went into Ukraine and uh what's happened there is very horrible, very, very horrible. Very sad. These are things that would have never happened. The attack on Israel would have never happened, would have never happened. And inflation would have never happened. We have inflation the worst we've had in 72 years. Inflation would have never happened. Energy caused inflation. We had energy low, he had energy high because of his stupid policies. Perhaps worst of all, even as they turn America into a crime ridden, gang infested terror-filled dumping ground, Joe Biden and his thugs will do everything in their power to confiscate your guns and annihilate your God-given right to self-defense. You have a right to self-defense. You've always had that right and during my four years nothing happened and there was great pressure on me having to do with guns. We did nothing. We didn't yield and once you yield a little bit, that's just the beginning. That's when the avalanche begins. Four more years of Joe Biden means four more years of anti-gun Communists running the ATF. They're going to run it. They've already—they're running it now just in case you have any questions, but it means hundreds of more radical left judges waging a crusade against law-abiding gun owners. And four more years of Joe Biden means a non-stop war on gun makers dealers and sellers designed to put the entire industry right out of business. They want to put it out of business, I tell you they've been—the NRA for me has been a great partner. They endorsed me early in 2016 and the relationship's been a great relationship and I don't know what they're doing in May, but I understand they're having a very big event in May. They better endorse me, that's the only thing I can say. That's actually an endorsement that means something. Well, I'm coming to Dallas in May, I can tell you that. The only thing standing between you and the obliteration of your under-siege Second Amendment is me. I'm the only thing. Anybody else, you wouldn't have your guns right now. You know they started with the ammunition. You know that they couldn't do the guns with me so then they started getting rid of the ammunition. People said I have a gun, I can't get ammunition. We took care of that very quickly. If Joe Biden is reelected, your gun rights will be gone, they'll be totally gone. You know the—the sad part of that is the bad guys aren't giving up their guns. The bad guys aren't, but the good people aren't giving up their guns either because there's never going to be anybody that's going to be asking for your guns. And when I'm reelected, every single Biden attack on gun owners and manufacturers will be terminated my very first week back in office. Perhaps my first day. And every pledge, and your officers will tell you this, every pledge I made to you as a candidate, I fulfilled as your president. Every single pledge. Just as I promised back in 2016, I appointed nearly 300 Pro-Constitution judges to interpret the law as written. I face down vile attacks from the radical left to confirm three great Supreme Court Justices their great justices. And standing before you at the NRA leadership Forum in 2019, I revoked America's signature from the globalist United Nations Arms Trade Treaty where basically they take your guns. Sir, they said, you can't do that, sir, all countries are signing that. Well number one, all countries didn't sign and most of the countries that signed didn't adhere to it anyway, but we would have. I said no, we're not doing it. Even the NRA officers were surprised at that one. I stood up for our hunters, fishers, and sportsmen like no one has ever done before, opening millions and millions of acres of federal land and rolling back Obama's assault on hunting, fishing, trapping and ammunition. Obama was brutal. Obama was brutal. Biden happened to be along for the ride. I think maybe that's still happening isn't it, huh? You know, whenever I say your President Barack Hussein Obama, they say oh he doesn't know who the president is. No, no it's bad to be sarcastic with this group when I do an imitation of him not being able to find the stairs, see how many stairs. We get about five of—I do an imitation, I go home my wife, said darling, our great first lady by the way, we have a great first lady, but I do an imitation and I go home, she says darling you couldn't find the stairway out. No, it was an imitation, the fake news makes it sound like I couldn't find my way off this stage. When I mention certain names, I do—they are the worst. They are the worst, but hopefully someday they'll learn. You know to make our country great we have to have a fair and free Press. It's very important, we need that, we need fair and free elections and we need strong borders. We have to have strong—and we're going to have all of them. We had them just a little while ago 3,years ago like nobody's ever had them before. When the radical left Democrats tried to use COVID to shut down gun sales during the China virus pandemic, I proudly designated gun and ammunition dealers as critical infrastructure. Did you know I did that? Does anybody know I did that? You know the heat—do you know the heat I took? Does anybody know the heat? I said gun dealers are critical infrastructure. That's an interesting one, but it worked we kept those places open I think maybe more than anybody in the world. Gun dealers, they do like Donald Trump. They're in—they're in business. No, they want to shut them down. They use COVID, they tried to use COVID to shut them down. My administration also petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn New York City's unconstitutional ban on transporting handguns outside of the home. Yeah, people walking on the streets with handguns that want to do bad things and you got to keep your handgun in home and to people that don't understand the industry and the gun world, they might think that sounds tough. It's not tough. It's really a survival, it's really is a—700 million guns out there and not all of them are had by very innocent people. And in a landmark case 2 years ago, the court affirmed that the right to self-defense does not end when you step out—outside the front door of your house. That was all things that we got together, but under crooked Joe B your second amendment is again under siege. You know that Biden has implemented a vicious Zero Tolerance policy. Do you know what that is? It's not good. That revokes the license of independent firearms dealers if they make a single minor error, little tiny error. They're out of business. He imposed the so-called pistol brace rule which orders law-abiding citizens to register or surrender guns with certain equipment. You know that many of you are forced to do it. I don't know, is everybody doing it as per their demand? Who in this group has done it? There's a hand way back there, by the way. This is a hell of a big building, it's packed. This is a big building, this a big—this place is packed, a lot of people outside too trying to get in. Arena, big arena. And now Biden is trying to ban all private gun transfers in the United States with the stroke of a pen. Let's ban them all under a Trump Administration. All of those Biden disasters get ripped up and torn out my first week but maybe my first day in office okay, okay maybe my first. You know on inauguration day—did you ever see you have the beautiful stairs of the capital behind you. You're speaking in front of thousands and thousands of people, millions of people watching. But on the way out you walk up a massive, like this a massive flight of stairs and I'm thinking about—you know I said few times, I said I'm going to do my first thing in the Oval Office. Well, the Oval Office is sort of far away, you have to walk up the stairs and then you have to walk quite a distance and then you have to go downstairs around corners, it takes you a long time. I'm thinking about doing this if we win. A lot of people say when, no you can never say when, you know. What you always have to say is if. We have to work hard to win. I don't like to—I don't like to jinx anything. I say if we win, we got to win. You got to win, but if we win—but or we could maybe make a minor change we'll call it if and when. If and when we win, I'm thinking about putting a desk somewhere on those stairs. I'm going to have a desk and I'm going to have a lot of papers in that desk and a lot of them are going to have to do with you and what you love and what you respect and we're going to knock out everything maybe before I get to the Oval Office. That'll look strange, won't it? We finish a nice speech to this incredible crowd goes all the way down to the Washington Monument. We had some—some crowd I'll tell you, but it goes all the way down and I'll be speaking, they'll say that's strange there's a desk about 12 stairs up. You got probably a 100, what is that desk doing there? And it might look strange but it's not going to be strange when I start signing those things, but we're going to knock it out. We're going to knock it out fast and it is true when the NRA endorsed me. You know I said I was going to do—but I was in the real estate business, and I was in business, generally we did great. But when I said it a lot of people didn't really believe the things I was able to do for the gun owners and for a lot of other a lot of other people too outside of the gun world, but we did every single thing and more. And it was my honor to do it. Incredible people, incredible people on day one, we will sack the radical gun grabber Steve Dettelbach, did you ever hear of Steve Dettelbach? Do you know who the hell he is? And we're going to replace him with an ATF director who respects the sacred right to keep and bear arms. You don't know who Dettelbach is? He's a guy that is not good for this room. He's not good for you. We will fire ultra-left interior secretary Deb Holland and appoint a secretary who truly loves our hunters, fishermen, sportsmen, and outdoorsman like my sons. My sons love Don and Eric. They're—they're great hunters, they love the outdoors, they love it to a point, like I say when are they coming back? And they're good too. They're good. If they were golfers, they—they'd be better than scrap. Does anyone know what I mean when I say that? They'd be better though, they're really good. They can shoot, they can shoot as well as about anybody, but they love it. It's a great passion and it's good for them. And we will completely overhaul the corrupt Department of Injustice [Department of Justice] to clear out all the Communists who have weaponized government activities and gone against conservatives and gun owners. And we will replace them with relentless crime fighters on a mission to put hideous criminals behind bars. If you're a violent criminal today, if you kill people, if you slaughter people if you mug people nothing happens. But if you're a religious person of a certain faith, you get persecuted and I don't know what's going on with Catholics, but Catholics are being treated very badly. I don't know if you know that, but they're being treated very, very badly. What the hell is going on with Catholics? And yet we got 88% of the Evangelical vote, but we only got 50% of the Catholic vote. We should get 110% of the Catholic vote. What they're doing to Catholics—but we have a sick and corrupt two-tiered system of justice in our country. Do I know better than anybody? As an example, it was just announced that Joe Biden—his Department of Injustice will bring zero charges against crooked Joe despite the fact that he willfully retained—willfully retained and disclosed throws of ultra-classified National Security documents. Now, that's not what I've been hearing and he's not under the Presidential Records Act, which is a big thing I am. It's a protective act. They're trying desperately to spin the Biden document disaster into an oh, but wasn't Trump worse? No, no Trump was by comparison—that was 50 years, and he did a lot of it when he was at a very young age. He was mentally a little better than he is right now, but no, I am covered by the very important Presidential Records Act and therefore, I did absolutely nothing wrong. Nothing wrong, but Biden wasn't president. Only the president is covered, is—it's a big deal and he wasn't covered. Also, Biden took documents over this long-term period as a senator and as a vice president. Well, that, you're not allowed to do. Much of this period he was at a very strong state, and he was fine. He was probably, in terms of the intelligence of senators, he was probably out of a hundred, he was probably in the 95 category. I'd say he was 95th on the list. He was never setting any records, he made recovery almost impossible. Recovery of documents. He made it almost impossible for the federal government to get them. In fact, he gave classified material to the writer of his book in total violation of just about everything. I cooperated with the very unfriendly and hostile feds. I cooperated far more than Biden did, who sent records to Chinatown and shipped them all over the place, he shipped them to Chinatown and all over the place. They don't tell—they don't tell you about that. He was even at Penn Biden Center. Do you know that he gets paid millions of dollars? You know that. You know who pays him? China, China. You have the Penn Center, right? Penn Biden Center. He gets paid millions of dollars, and they pay like close to $100 million to the school itself and by the way, I went there. I went—went to a place called The Wharton School of Finance, so I know all about Penn. I love Penn, but Penn is getting a little bit out there and they were also sitting underneath his beautiful Corvette that he talks so much about in a very flimsy garage with one of those very cheap garage doors. You know you can cut it open with a scissor? Does anybody have a scissor? I want to get some classified documents, let's cut it open. It had no security, no secret service, no nothing. And certain members of the Biden family live there. I wonder what they did with those very important documents. But they had no secret service people there because he wasn't president. And Mar-a-Lago, loaded with secret—we have more secret service, but Biden fought them all the way. I didn't. They're trying to make it the other way. No, Biden fought them very hard, and they never got what they wanted to get. Anyway, I even gave the DOJ and the—the FBI lunch at Mar-a-Lago. You know, they say I didn't behave. I gave them lunch. I said have lunch at beautiful Mar-a-Lago where they asked us to—do you mind sir doubling up the locks on the doors? Yeah, I'll double them up, we had locked doors. I'll double them up and I did that. The discussions were good and then they ended up with—and they raided my house. They did it for publicity reasons. They did it for election interference reasons. They want to interfere with the election, so I guess they expected dinner, not lunch. I should have given them dinner, not lunch. I mean if Biden is not going to be charged, he said that's up to them. You know, look, if he's not going to be charged, that's up to them, but then I should not be charged. This is nothing more than select persecution of Biden's political opponent, me. And I don't know that it's Biden cause I don't think he knows he's alive but it's—it's vicious and very smart people that surround the Resolute desk. You know the Resolute desk is the most beautiful desk. You know, when you're president they allow you to pick your desk. There are things that are very nice, very nice and they have these unbelievable desks. One of them is the resolute desk. That's the one I took, and it had a tremendous history of presidents behind it and uh he has the same desk. I think he took it because he likes me so much. You know, he said I want to use this, I want the same desk as President Trump had, but never has such a thing as what he's done with the weaponization of our government, DOJ, FBI. It's never taken place in our country, it only takes place in third world countries, it has never happened in in our country before and the local DAs are part of it and the attorney generals are all a part of it. You saw what happened in Atlanta with Fani—how do you pronounce Fani? They interviewed her. I would never have an affair with anybody in my office. Well, she had an affair, and they paid the guy almost a million dollars, the only way. And it—and honestly that just corrupts all of justice and they spent a lot of time at the White House. You—you read that, it came out last week, right? Everybody read it. If you didn't read it, I'm telling you now and I'm telling all the fake news back there—they spent a lot of time in the White House, and you know what? They were talking about—how do we get Trump? How do we get him? He's been quite elusive over the years, hasn't he? He's been quite elusive. The only way to defeat this corrupt and weaponized system is to defeat crooked Joe Biden, to vote overwhelmingly for President Donald J. Trump in November, which is voting for yourselves. Biden administration, every fact government has been perverted, corrupted, and turned upside down and inside out. The justice department persecutes law-abiding gun owners and pro-life Christians, while violent felons are released from jails. Thousands and thousands. A 95-year-old veteran was kicked out of a nursing home, a 95-year-old veteran. A highly regarded veteran—to make way for an illegal alien that came into our country. Gangs, the most vicious gangs you've ever seen. They make our gangs look like very nice people by comparison, from Venezuela, Honduras, and El Salvador. Treated like victims while Republicans are treated like criminals. We're treated like criminals and a lot of other groups of people in this country. Rich people are given $7,000 subsidies to buy luxury electric cars, they could it—electric cars in this world, they don't go far. You know, somebody said—how do you describe it in a simple manner. I said, I have an idea, they don't go far. Doesn't sound very glamorous, but it happens to be true. You know when I was in Iowa, I told you, 40° below zero, there was so many cars in the road. I said boy, there are a lot of cars out here. No, these are cars because electric cars don't work in very cold weather, so I would say 40° below zero is a fine test and I came back with a result that they don't work in cold weather. It's right, but they do it using money stolen from middle class families who cannot afford to buy a car for themselves. The whole electric car thing is crazy. Crazy, it's crazy. Everybody should have the right to buy an electric car, but you know, we have liquid gold under our feet more than any other country. We can have combustion—we can have combustion engines. We can have hybrids. Hybrids are actually pretty good. You know, the combination of both, but all electric, unless you're going to go very short distances, I wouldn't want to. I wouldn't want to go long. I wouldn't want to go long. And there—oh we're going to drill, baby drill. That's what we're going to do, going to drill baby drill. We'll drill baby. [cheers and applause]. Thank you very much, thank you that was very—you guys have a good voice. No, we're going to drill baby drill. We're going to get our prices down. We had—we had gasoline at numbers that you hadn't seen in 25 years. We were selling, we were doing so incredible we never had a country that was doing so well as it was during the Trump four years, which is why we're—which is why we're leading in the polls. We're leading everybody, we're leading. I think the Republican primary is essentially over, that's what I hear. We'll go to South Carolina. We're going to do great in South Carolina. We're actually going—we're actually going tomorrow to South Carolina. You know, I used to have a nice, simple life. I didn't have to go around and make speeches to massive stadiums and if you say one word, a little bit mispronunciation, you end up front page, what's wrong with him? You make nine speeches. I have a guy I'm competing against who does—he hasn't spoken in months and when he does, it's not pretty is it? Not pretty, not pretty and I got ","to know President Xi of China and Putin of Russia. Got to know a lot of the leaders. They—they're tough cookies and smart and uh, I just can't imagine what happens when they close the doors and go into a little negotiation. Unfortunately, I know what happens and it's not good for America, it's not good. A vote for Biden is a vote for all of this communist lunacy that you're seeing around you, with the open boarders, and all of the problems that are caused. A vote for Trump is really a vote for common sense. You know, we're conservative and all of that, but I say more than anything else, it's common sense. We want borders, we want strong borders, we want great education, we want low taxes, we want a powerful military, but not necessarily to use it every week on going after countries that don't want anything to do with you. The day I'm inaugurated is the day that law and order, sanity, and justice will return back to the United States of America. On day one, we will seal the border and stop the invasion of America. We're being invaded just like it's a military invasion. There's no difference you know? We are—we are losing in my opinion 300—350,000 people a year to fentanyl. There's no war for the most part. Where you're going to lose that many soldiers, where you're going to lose that many people, we're losing 350,000 I believe. They always say it's 100, 125, it's not. It's much more. It's getting worse too. We had a very strong border. It was very hard for them to get things through our border and now they just walk through. Nobody checks. We spend a lot of money on equipment. I said, get me the best equipment, but do you know the best thing for detecting drugs is a certain type of German Shepherd? You know that they are unbelievable. There's no machine that costs $2 million each that can even come close, so I love those dogs. I think they're great, they—they—you can't get away with it. I mean, they put them in their cylinders of a gas car, they don't have cylinders in the electric cars, too much. But they put them in hub caps, they put them in places I always say. You know, I've seen the way they bring them in. If they would devote that genius to making money legitimately, they'd be very wealthy people. But what they do is incredible—but the best thing you have is a certain type of German Shepherd. It's unbelievable, they go right up to it, they say, that's it. They point to it, you take off the hub cap, and stuff pours out. You say hey. But you know, we worked hard on it, and we had it way down and now it's coming in at a level of 10 times more than what it was four years ago. Ten times more. Many people are dying of fentanyl, and I had to deal with President Xi—that he was going to give the maximum penalty for sending fentanyl to the United States. I had that deal because he understood tariffs. I charged him a massive hundreds of millions of dollars China paid to the United States. Not one president ever, not one president got 10 cents for—China, they're great negotiators. You know they say, but we are a developing nation. Well, so are we. Have you seen our cities? Our cities—you might as well redevelop and we're going to do that by the way. We're going to redevelop our cities in this country and we're going to redevelop and fix our Capital, which is a murder den. People are getting murdered every single week, many people in some cases. We're going to bring back our Capital, we're going to bring back law and order. We're going to have the federal government run it and we're going to bring back the Capital, Washington D.C. We're going to put it in the safe fold, we're going to have it safe, we're going to have it clean, we're going to take the graffiti off the marble columns. Those beautiful beautiful marble columns put up a 100 years ago and more, these gorgeous Carrara columns. I know all about the marbles. I can tell you every marble, but these beautiful columns that are incredible. How they could have done it years ago without the powerful tractors that you have today and lifters and cranes—they got them up and they're beautiful and they have graffiti on them. We're not going to have any more graffiti and we're not going to have roads that are in bad shape. We're not going to have medians that are falling down, we're not going to have paper that's been down for six months. I mean, you look at some of this, you look at the damage, the destruction, the filth. And you have cars and I wonder what these leaders say as they're driving into Washington D.C. and there's paper all over the roads and beer cans and everything all over the road strewn all over the place and the medians are falling down. You know that metal median that they use so much. Real garbage. I mean, you put it up and I think the sun makes it warp, you ever see this stuff? You put it up, two weeks later, the thing looks like it's been up there for 30 years. What crap. Somebody made a lot of money doing that. Whoever the man that sells that stuff is, I want to hire him immediately cause I think he's the greatest salesman on earth. They're all laughing because they know exactly what I'm talking about. Right, right. The little ching ding ding this—it's like you put it down the next day, it's like this. I—you have to understand that was my business. I was really good at that business called construction. Three years ago, we had the most secure border in the history of our country. We ended 'catch and release.' We built 561 miles of border wall. We got Mexico to send 28,000 soldiers to our border, free of charge. Everyone said you didn't get them free, I said, I got them free, by the way. I used to say Mexico is going to pay for a big piece of the wall. Mexico paid much more than that, they gave us free soldiers, free military. They did things for us because that—I could do—you're not allowed to do that, they can't pay for our wall. No mechanism, but there was a mechanism where they can give us soldiers, 28,000 soldiers, and you know it was very interesting. Uh some of you have heard the story, but I went to Mexico, one woman in the state department was terrific, but she was a lousy negotiator actually, but a terrific woman. She dealt with Mexico for 25 years and she said, sir you're not going to be able to get this stuff. I went to Tom Homan, I went to Brandon Jud, the border patrol, I went to these great—I said, what are your top—give me a top 10 list, and they gave me a top 10 list. No more 'catch and release,' no more a lot of things. We want the wall, we want the this, we want that, we wanted a lot of different things, and the woman looked at me she said, sir we've been after that for 25 years, as long as I can, you'll never get it. I said, yes we will 100%. Sir, you won't be able to get it. And I like the President of Mexico, the former president I guess, he's going to be taken off for somebody else has taking his place. I'm sure I like the person that's taking his place, we'll get along just fine, but I like—so what happened is, I said no, no, they're going to have to give us 28,000 soldiers. That's a lot of money. I also want a thing called remain in Mexico, is that a good idea? Remain. Remain in Mexico, you know Biden ended this when he ended remain in Mexico and I built all of these hundreds of miles of wall in three weeks. We could have thrown up another 200 miles of wall in 3 weeks and that's when I realized they want open borders. Cause they didn't want it and they took the wall, which was exactly what the border patrol wasn't. My design, it was a design by border patrol. I frankly would have liked concrete plank going straight up, but you had to be able to see through a lot of different things. They wanted it to be steel concrete and rebar. I built everything, even the paddle on top. I hate the way it looks, but it's called an anti-climb paddle. It makes it almost impossible, unless you're a Mount Everest climber, to get over the wall. These guys would scoot over the wall like it was nothing, but that's an anti-climb panel. We did everything they wanted and we built it, and it was so much more than I promised to build and then I said we need more because people would go out on these sketches, and we had to fill in the certain areas that were hard to get legally from eminent domain and various other things. So, what happened is, we're building the wall, a lot of people coming in. A lot of death, a lot of destruction, a lot of people pouring in, but peanuts compared to what it is. This is peanuts and I got Mex—I said you're going to have to pay for the soldiers free of charge. They laughed at me, they said, we're not doing that. I said you have to. I'm sorry, we're not doing it. Sir, you have to be—here's a guy, handsome guy beautiful representative, he laughed. He said, sir we're not giving you soldiers, why the hell would we give you soldiers? He's actually thinking to himself, we've been ripping off the United States for years, why the hell would we give them soldiers to protect their border, we're not doing that. We want them out of Mexico. These people that are coming up, a lot of criminals, a lot of bad people are coming through. So, I said, no, no you're giving it to us 100%. No, no, no, no, sir, I'm not giving it to you. I said, listen, 100% that you're giving it to me. We're not giving it to you sir. You're giving it to us. He goes, no way. I go way. [laughter]. And that—so we left it. I said, here's the story, you're going to give us every one of these items. I have 10 items and remain in Mexico is a big one, but no more 'catch and release,' we call it 'catch, catch, and release' in Mexico. We had 'catch and release' in the United States. We catch a criminal, and we release the criminal in the United States, what the hell. And then we say, come back in six years for a court case. Only the really dumb ones came back, most of them just—that was it, they were in our country. We had them, but some really dumb ones came back. I'm here to go through a court case, oh wonderful, thank you very much. So, what happened is, I said no, you're going to give it to us. So, he said, why are you so confident that I'm going to give it to you. I said, here's why, because I have before me a document and I'm signing it now and if you don't give us 28,000 soldiers immediately to protect our border from people pouring into our country, I am going to charge you a 25% tariff on every single thing you make, including all of the cars, because you stole. You know they stole 32% of our car industry, by the way, in case you don't know and every car made in Mexico that gets sold in the United States is going to have a 25% tariff and if it doesn't take place within a month, it's going to go to 50% and then 75%. And he said, sir may I please take 5 minutes and call my President. I said, you may. He comes comes back, sir it would be a great honor to supply you with 28,000, so—my—it would be my honor. Sir, it would be my honor and we had a great relationship with Mexico, and we had the safest border we've ever had in this country ever had. And—and then as the wall got built longer and longer—but we could have added another 200 miles and they didn't want to do it. And then, they ended up selling that expensive wall, very expensive. They sold it for 5 cents and 10 cents on the dollar, for scrap. And that's when I said, these people really want open borders. It's not even believable. But we did a hell of a job I'll tell you and uh we'll do it again and we're going to do it again bigger, better, stronger than ever before. It's all going to happen. It's all going to happen, and we have no choice. And if we don't get elected, we have no country any longer. I really believe that these people—they're crazy these people. What they're doing to our country is insane, you have to see some of the people coming into our country are—these are hardened criminals, these are hard tough, they're prisoners. They make our prisoners look like very nice people. Okay, these are hardened criminals who are coming into our country and now you're seeing the problem you saw where they beat the hell out of two police officers in New in New York City. And then the DA said, let them go, that's okay. But he goes after Trump. Goes after Trump. You have to be a violent criminal, if you're a violent criminal you have no problem. Under Biden, millions of illegals are now pouring into our country, and these include terrorists. You know you have a 100—100% chance of a major terror attack in the not too distant future. What—it's a terrible thing to say. I went four years with no terror attack, four years. And I could never talk about it, we call it the ban. Remember the travel ban? We cleaned up the name a little bit, but we didn't take people from countries with the massive terrorism and the attacks, we don't want our shopping centers blown up. We don't want our people destroyed, we don't want dead children, children where a family will never be the same. We're never going to do—we're not going to do that and we did a job, but I never talked about it. I couldn't talk about it because I didn't want to say about how well we're doing on terrorism and then have a terrorist attack the next day. So, I never got to talk about it. But the day I left, I started talking about what a great job we did. Thousands and thousands of people are coming in and you notice they're all men and they're all between 18 and 25 or 26 years old. Practically meaning like military. Think of it, very few women, I don't want to disrespect you when I say few women, but that's the way it goes sometimes. I got to tell it like it is, not a lot of women. Men are coming into our country at level and a lot of them coming in 29,000 from China over the last few months. Twenty-nine thousand. They're coming in from Yemen, you know the bombing has already started when I was uh thinking about doing this—the Middle East was being bombed to hell and I said, you know it's not necessary. We can do it in a much better way. They have to respect your leaders. I looked yesterday. There's bombs going up all over the place, everyone's fighting. It's a whole mess, we had uh a great, great leader Victor Orban. You know who he is. Of Hungary, Victor Orban, he said there's only one way that this problem is going to be solved because the whole world is blowing up. You look at Ukraine, you look at Israel, you look at the whole Middle East. You look at everything. China is talking about going into Taiwan, but Victor is a tough leader and a smart man and highly respected. But he's tough and he was interviewed recently, and he said, there's only one way it gets solved. Trump has to become president of the United States again because people respected him. I knew exactly what he was talking about. When I'm President, instead of trying to send the state of Texas a restraining order, I will send them reinforcements. They're going to get reinforcements. They're doing a good job. And I'll use all necessary military and law enforcement resources to defend the United States of America. We're going to be very strong and within moments of my inauguration, we will begin the largest deportation operation in American history. We have no choice, we have no choice, we have no choice. And we're going to start with the very bad ones because the very bad ones are very, very bad. They're worse than anybody you've seen, and we know who—you know who knows who they are? Your police force, your local police know exactly who they are. They know them by name. We have to respect our police. Our police have done a great job and they have not been given the kind of respect that they deserve. We're going to let our police do their job. Did you ever see—I mean we have a phenomena going on now where a department store, for years, they wanted to go into a city, a location, and they finally got it built. They spent millions of dollars and now this new phenomena, where hundreds of people rush into the store, mostly younger people with masks and everything, they rush into the store and they walk out with television sets. And I mean I saw one the other day walking out with a refrigerator, he's got this massive—I said he's a pretty strong guy, right? Can you believe? And the police are—say that they're not allowed, it's not that they don't do anything, they're not allowed. They say you will not do anything to stop this. We can stop that, this is a new phenomenon, nobody's ever seen it before, where they send 300 kids into a department store and within 15 minutes the entire store is wiped out millions and millions of dollars. Then they close the store, and the neighborhood becomes a blighted neighborhood, the whole thing, it's like a chain. It's a chain effect and it's a horrible thing that's happening. There's no respect for our law enforcement and our law enforcement could have respect very quickly and you could stop that phenomena in one day, in one city, if you got tough. If you got tough, the whole country would see it and it would stop immediately, despite the worst border crisis in US history. Crooked Joe Biden just tried to ram through a massive open borders bill that would allow nearly 2 million illegals per year. Did you see that 5,000 people a week, some people said 5,000 people a day, but I think they meant 5,000 a week were allowed to come in, dispense unlimited numbers of work permits for illegal aliens to steal American jobs. The unions are going to be out of business, I'm—I'm telling you if the teamsters endorse Biden, here's the good news, most of the teamsters are going to vote for me anyway. But—and the unions and workers, just workers—but you give illegal taxpayer funded lawyers so they have millions of dollars in this agreement, in this deal, which we by the way killed. I think we killed it. I think it's dead, but you can never say it because bad bills always come back to life because these guys make a lot of money with bad bills. But they give millions, tens of millions of dollars, it's down there to lawyers to represent the illegal immigrants that come into our country. It's—it's not even believable. Some of the things—do you ever notice they come off everybody has a cell phone, they come in, they get off a bus, there's always some nice person greeting them. I don't know who these people are. They hello welcome, do you ever notice that they have like these people, nice women, beautiful women, hello, it's so nice to see you. The guy looks at her like he's going a rip her apart. Hello, he never saw this, he—nobody ever shook his hand before. Hello, here's your cell phone, here's your this, here's your credit card, would you like to stay today at the Waldorf Historia, oh would you like a Trump Hotel. No, it's crazy. It's crazy our soldiers are great veterans, I met some of the incredible parents of of some Fallen Soldiers in the back, incredible. They have the pictures on their—on their chests. Just beautiful, beautiful kids. We have veterans that are living like dogs on the streets, and we have illegal immigrants who are living in luxury hotels with cell phones and credit cards. And that's going to all change very fast. What's going to change because we're not allowing people into our country anymore unless you come in legally, so it's going to change in that way and in fact, one of the bill's top Democrat Architects admitted just yesterday that illegal aliens are quote, ""the people that we care most about,"" they care. The Democrats care most, he said, these are the people we care most about because you know why? They want those people to vote now. The good news is they cheat so much they really don't need them, that's why I was never a believer. They cheat with ballots, and they drop ballots and fake ballots and a hundred different things. They got more ways of cheating, it's a way of life, it's become a way of life. Our elections are so rigged, but just in case they're going to be voting, those people are going to be voting. They try and get them registered. They don't speak a word of English, you're going to register here, oh, oh I see, but they have no idea what's going on. They want to get them to vote. In our movement, we believe the highest priority should be law-abiding Americans, not illegal aliens. We got to take care of our soldiers. We have to take care of our veterans and our police and our firemen, people that have loved our country. I mean, you see it over the last few days, I don't know what it is I've been saying, I wonder why it doesn't seem like—because the fake news doesn't want to report migrant—we call it migrant crime. It's unbelievable what's going on and now, for the first time, you're seeing migrant crime. These are tough people, again, many of them come out of jails and mental institutions—didn't—not just sitting there looking for a job, learning English. And let me get a great job, these are tough people, these are hardened criminals in many cases and now you're seeing migrant crime when a policeman goes up to them, they laugh right in the policeman's face and then punch him in the face. These are not innocents. These are tough people and we're taking them by the millions. We're taking millions of people, millions and millions, we have no idea who they are, where they come from. We're not doing it anymore, we're not doing it anymore, and the biggest fear I have, the biggest problem I have—10 months is a long time. The damage that could be done to our country in 10 months, including World War II, including World War I, the way we're going we're going to end up in World War III. We have a guy that can't put two sentences together and he's in charge of negotiations with Russia, with China, with North Korea, it's a dangerous—we're in a very dangerous position. I—I believe we've never been in a more dangerous position in our lives and if the Senate wants to pass a real border bill, they should establish criminal penalties for senior Biden officials who refuse to enforce the existing law. They don't want to do anything. You know, you don't need a bill. The president has the right to say close the borders. The bill is a hoax. The Democrats are asking for this bill, that's so ridiculous. It's a horrible bill, it's actually going to make it worse, but I keep saying you don't need a bill. I did it, I had no bill, and you know what I did. We're having a hard time with some of our Senators, our wonderful Senators. I took it out of the military to build the wall because I called it an invasion. This is an invasion. This is a military invasion and I built the wall mostly with funds from our military. I said, I'm sorry, you know you give the military $750 billion, you can take a little bit out to stop an invasion of our country. After seeing the recent video of a wild pack of illegal aliens viciously attacking these two New York City really good people too, I saw an interview high quality police officers. I'm going to ask Congress to pass a strong sentencing enhancement bill that any illegal alien assaulting a police officer, they immediately go to jail or even better, they get thrown out of the country, brought back to the country that came from because putting them in jail is very expensive for us. Very expensive. For the past three years, the radical left has been busy persecuting me, my family Christians Patriots, and even the NRA. And meanwhile the country is in chaos and bloodthirsty criminals are running wild and roaming our streets crooked Joe Biden and the radical left Democrats, they don't care one bit about the terrible suffering of their people, the people in this country. The policies that—they've caused all of this destruction and death, but I do care. I care a lot because I didn't need this. I had a very nice life, nice Saturday afternoon. I could tell you if I weren't doing this where I would have been, I would have been in a very nice location. But I didn't need this, but I'm so happy I did. A lot of people say president, could I ask you if you had because they see the way I'm being persecuted by these animals. They said, president if you had it to do again—successful people ask me this question all the time, would you do it again? You know what I say? Absolutely. What we're doing is so important. We're not going to have a country left, we're going to make America great again. It's very simple, but they asked me that, they asked me a few questions, they asked me that one, would you do it again? Always, the answer is very quick. I don't even have to think about it. The answer is yes, we're going to make this country so great, better than it's ever been. It would have been easier if we just did to the other four years—it was all set to go but now we have to bring it back because now it's gone. It's gone substantially down since this character took over or whoever it is that's running it cause nobody really knows. But, when I'm back in the White House—remember that's the one question they ask. The other question they ask is, will they do it again, sir, will they do it again? In other words, they're going to cheat again. We're not going to let them cheat, we're not going to let them cheat. Whoever thought it was even possible when I'm back in the White House, we will mount an all-out campaign to stop the scourge of violent crime in America. We're going to stop it upon my inauguration, I will direct a completely overhaul DOJ to investigate every radical out of control prosecutor in America for their illegal, racist, and reverse enforcement of the law. Then we will smash the gangs, the street crews, and the criminal networks that are tearing up our country. They're tearing up our country, they have criminal networks that are like businesses. They run better than most businesses and they run viciously and violently. It's not NRA members who are shooting up their communities so, instead of trying to eviscerate the rights of law-abiding gun owners, I will have federal law enforcement prosecute the countless gun crimes committed by gang members drug dealers and convicted felons. You know, when I went to China, I got to know President Xi of China. A very strong man, a very strong man and he said uh it is so nice to meet you. I said nice to meet you too. We started talking about different things. I said, what about drugs in China? Do you have a drug problem? No, no, no, we have no drug problem. Think of it, 1.4 billion people. No, no, no, we have no drug problem. I say, so how'd you pull that one off. Now, they used to have a massive with the poppy, the Opium I mean. There was a drugged-out country like we're becoming. You know we're becoming a drugged-out country, I don't know if you know it or not. We have drugs at a level that's never been seen anywhere. You have to look at the statistics this year. We're becoming China at one time. Many years ago—was a drugged out country and weak countries were taking parts of China. Other countries were taking parts that would normally never be able to happen. But years ago, they instituted the death penalty for drug dealers and as soon as they did that, it stopped. It stopped. So, I said, you have a drug problem? No, no, no, he looked like—you know like, what the hell kind of a stupid question is that—do we? Of course we don't have a drug problem. I say, what do you attribute to quick trial. I said, quick trial, what is a quick trial? If you're a drug dealer and if you get caught selling drugs, they give you an immediate trial, immediate. And then sadly you're executed and so the drug dealers don't go there. They don't have a drug problem at all. They have a very meaningful death penalty. They don't have a drug deal at all and uh they don't have a problem like at all. One point four billion people. No, no problem and frankly, you know, we organized all these committees. We did a good job. I had the first lady on committees. I had a lot of nice people. I had a lot of socialites from New York, with a lot of socialites from Philadelphia, where they all want to be on and many of them just love the glamour being on a committee. But they don't know about El Chapo, they don't know about the—they don't know about the toughness that you're talking about, the ruthlessness that you're talking about, and they do things. And they have a little discussion and then start talking about when they're having dinner, where they're going. I wonder how nice it is—nice to be—they talk about restaurants. No, the only way you're solving that problem, and I don't know that our country is ready for it—remember this, every drug dealer kills a minimum of 500 people during his or her lifetime. When you think of that, maybe you think differently. I don't—I don't know that this country is ready for it, but until you have the death penalty for drug dealers, you're never going to solve the problem, you're just kidding yourself. You're just kidding yourself, but I don't know that it's ready, but I will know when it's ready because it's getting really bad. It's gotten so bad over the last three years. We've never seen increases like this ever before. I'm also going to indemnify our great police officers and law enforcement officials throughout the United States to protect them from being destroyed by the radical left for taking strong action on crime. No, they get rough with some horrible criminal, they lose their job. They lose their pension, they lose their wife or a husband, they lose their family, they—they get destroyed because they're doing their job. We're going to indemnify them. They're told to go out and get your own lawyer, can you imagine you're a policeman and you're—you're dealing with rough people in many cases, and they say go get your own lawyer. We're not going to—we're not going to do anything. We're not going to spend the money. No, we're going to indemnify police officers that do their job. We're going to indemnify them and precincts and, in s","ome cases, states depending on who's running the state, we're going to work with Democrats, we're going to work with whoever. But we are giving indemnification to the police for doing their job. They're not going to be sued and destroyed or fired and destroyed, we're not going to let that happen and to further deter these barbaric criminals and help you defend yourself and your family, I will ask Congress to send a bill to my desk delivering the national right to carry reciprocity. You're going to have that and if you have a—a meaningful Second Amendment, which you have, it's under siege. They got nowhere with me, but they got a lot of, lot of things happening with Biden. It has to go across state lines. You have to be able to go across state lines with Second Amendment privileges just as I did before. I will appoint rock solid conservative originalist to the federal bench including the United States Supreme Court. Great new justices, almost 300 judges throughout the country. Big difference. I will stop the effort to deny banking and financial services to gun makers and dealers, they won't allow banks to deal with them and I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency, which is a method of stealing your money, very dangerous. And we will restore free speech in America. We will have free—we do not have it now. We will reverse the Biden ban on natural gas exports. We will end his war on American Energy, and we will unleash Pennsylvania oil and natural gas at a level never seen before on the world stage. We will restore peace through strength. On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing Critical Race Theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial sexual or political content onto our children. And I will keep men out of women sports, how crazy. And we will—will secure our elections with one day voting voter ID. We are going to have paper ballots and we are going to have great secure elections. You would have no idea how big a difference that will make and in conclusion, this is the most important election in the history of our country. You know, I used to say in 2016 this is the most important and I meant it, but you look at the border, we had border problem in 2016. I fixed it so strong that it wasn't even talked about in 2020. I kept saying to my people, I want to talk about the border. What a great job I did. They said, sir nobody cares about the border you fixed it"" I couldn't talk about it and yet we still got millions and millions more votes in 2020 that we did in—we did much better in 2020. A lot of bad things happened, you know that's not going to let that happen again. But we did much much better millions and millions and more votes. We got the most votes in the history of our country for a president, but now we're going to blow that number away. I've never seen ever such spirit we had 2016—2020 the level of spirit was incredible. This blows it away because basically you've seen how incompetent these people that are destroying our country, what they're doing to Pennsylvania is one of the most important Battleground states in the nation, you know when I won Pennsylvania in 2016 remember they said no, Pennsylvania won't be able to be won. Everybody said that hadn't been won I think 36 years and I won Pennsylvania again. Did much better in Pennsylvania than we did in 2016 too. And I was just coming over and some of the guys working here said, sir you are more popular in this state right now, you're going to blow Pennsylvania away that's what I think is going to happen. But if you live in this Commonwealth, register everyone you know and get them out to vote, we have to—we have to win in November or we're not going to have Pennsylvania. They'll change the name, they're going to change the name of Pennsylvania how about all over the country. They're taking the name of George Washington off high schools and other things. George, that's one even I thought was safe. Abraham Lincoln and George Washington, their names are now endangered. No, we are going to have to win, you're not going to have a country anymore, you're not going to have a state anymore, you're not going to have anything. We have to swamp them with so many votes that they can't rig it, or they can't steal it. You know at a certain level, they can't rig it anymore, it's too much. Pennsylvania is the Commonwealth where our founding fathers declared American independence, such an incredible State, politically it's where they designed and wrote our glorious Constitution. It's where Pennsylvania Oil came out the first well. Do you know that in the United—United States, Pennsylvania Oil and where strong Pennsylvania steel was poured into the backbone of our country and now US steel was just sold to Japan. Okay, how do you feel about that? How do you feel about that? I wouldn't approve that deal, I wouldn't approve it and this is the state where generations of tough strong Pennsylvania workers, farmers, soldiers, and laborers forged the greatest nation in the history of the world. But now we are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation. We don't like to say that, I don't like to say that we are a failing nation. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, its willpower and its strength. Think of that, we've lost our confidence as a nation. We are a nation that has lost its way, but we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Three years ago, we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again. It was hardworking patriots like you who built this country and it's hardworking patriots like you who are going to save our country. We will fight for America like no one has ever fought before. 2024 is our fin—final battle. With you at my side, we will demolish the Deep State, we will expel the war mongers from our government, we will drive out the globalists. We will cast out the Communists, Marxists, fascists, we will throw off the sick political class that hates our country. We will protect our Second Amendment. We will evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House on November 5th 2024, that's when it begins. The great silent majority is rising like never before and under our leadership the Forgotten man and woman will be forgotten no longer. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God and together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you everybody. God bless you all. Thank you, Pennsylvania, thank you all. God bless.",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370372",3972,"CHARLESTON, S.C. – While the country is being submerged into chaos by two grumpy old men, Nikki Haley is the only candidate with the focus, stamina, and energy to make America normal again. Let's review: Trump and D.C. Republicans this week: Trump lost his quest for ""total immunity"" in court and pledged to spend millions more to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. After announcing it was broke, the RNC imploded this week. The GOP-controlled House suffered two embarrassing failures on the impeachment of Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and aid to Israel. The Senate was forced to pull a border security bill because Trump demanded no action until November. Biden and D.C. Democrats this week:  A special counsel report revealed Joe Biden has serious mental deficiencies: ""We have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.""   Joe Biden held a disastrous press conference to try to beat back rumors of his mental incompetency. He did not succeed.  Nikki Haley this week:  Nikki Haley blitzed the state of California, raising a staggering $1.7 million.   A new poll from Marquette University shows Haley is the only Republican candidate who can knock down Democrats' blue wall in Wisconsin.   Haley earned the endorsement of the conservative Detroit News in the early voting state of Michigan.   While Trump is barely in South Carolina, Haley announced a two-week bus tour across the Palmetto State.   National Review has a new analysis poking holes in Trump's South Carolina lead.  ""Everything Donald Trump touches explodes in chaos and incompetence,"" said Haley national spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. ""No wonder 70 percent of Americans don't want to see a Trump-Biden rematch. Nikki Haley is the only candidate with the focus and clarity to clean up Washington and deliver conservative results for the American people.""Here's what they're saying… Fox News: Haley hauls in $1.7 million in fundraising during swing through Super Tuesday state ""I'm in this for the long haul,"" Haley emphasized at a campaign rally at the American Legion Hollywood Post 43 in Los Angeles on Wednesday evening…And she touted that you don't end up being ""the last one standing against Donald Trump if you don't manage your money well. So yes, we are focused on making sure we have the resources."" National Review: Why Haley Probably Is Doing Better in South Carolina than the Polls Show Pollsters generally do a fine job at a difficult task, and we should praise Monmouth for openly acknowledging the sampling challenge it faced. Savvy observers should look at the polls that will be released soon to see how other pollsters address this substantial hurdle. The more polling firms limit their sample to traditional GOP primary voters, the likelier they are to overstate Trump's already substantial edge. Politico: New Wisconsin poll shows Trump tied with Biden, Haley ahead by 15 points Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's argument that she'd be a stronger general election candidate than former President Donald Trump got a boost on Wednesday from a new poll in a critical swing state. Detroit News: Editorial: Our endorsement for the Michigan Republican primary Nikki Haley is the type of presidential candidate America says it wants. Younger, focused on the future and not obsessed with litigating past grievances, the Republican is ready to receive the presidential torch on behalf of her generation. AP: Haley plans a two-week bus tour before South Carolina's GOP primary as Trump returns to the state The tour is aiming to ramp up interest in South Carolina's early-voting period, which begins Monday, according to Haley's campaign. It's also a complement to her repeated critiques of Trump for not spending time in the state, as she's crisscrossed it, holding nearly a dozen campaign events across South Carolina in the past two weeks.","","",""

CHARLESTON, S.C. – In an appearance with Fox News' Sean Hannity last night, Nikki Haley highlighted the dangerous similarities between Donald Trump and Joe Biden: both mishandled classified documents, and neither is at the top of his game. While Joe Biden is confusing the presidents of Mexico and Egypt, Donald Trump is mixing up Haley and Nancy Pelosi. Neither followed the national security protocols in place to keep America's secrets secure. Watch here:   I think the first thing is you look at the fact that we need to take the politics out of all of our agencies. Whether this is Clinton, whether this is Biden, whether this is Trump, they all need to be handled fairly. And clearly that's not the case. We have to get rid of the double standard. And that continues to show itself.  The second thing is, it is unbelievably disturbing that they see Biden to not have a good memory, that they see him as diminished, that they see that it's a problem, and they point-blank say that. I mean, this is actually dangerous.  People make fun of the fact that I say we need to have mental competency tests. There's a reason 70% of Americans don't want to see a Biden-Trump rematch. The party that gets rid of their 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins.  The third thing that bothers me about this is, whether it's Biden or whether it's Trump, they both knew better. You know when you work around national security documents… you know what's not supposed to leave the office. You don't go bragging about these national security documents. You don't leave them in a garage. Whatever it is, both these men knew better and the arrogance that they both had to think they could walk out with these documents and just not think that there were going to be any repercussions… So I mean look, it's a disturbing day for America right now. I think we've got some work to do.","","",""

Younger, focused on the future and not obsessed with litigating past grievances, the Republican is ready to receive the presidential torch on behalf of her generation. Michigan Republican primary voters should hand it to her on Feb. 27. The 2024 presidential election should be no place for old men, particularly not if those old men are former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. Between them, they've given the nation nearly eight years of chaos and division. Do Americans, do Michigan Republicans, really want four more years of that? Trump is obsessively preoccupied with the perceived wrong done to him in the 2020 presidential balloting, while Biden has only one talking point in this campaign: Trump. Weariness with their combined ineptitude is why roughly two-thirds of voters say they want to see someone other than Trump and Biden on the November ballot. Meet Nikki Haley. The former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador could bring American politics back from the extremes. While a true conservative, Haley is also a pragmatist who understands a divided nation needs a leader willing to compromise and committed to consensus governing. Her nuanced position on the most contentious issue of the day, abortion, is aimed at producing a solution the maximum number of Americans can support. Rather than an all-or-nothing stance, she favors a policy that would keep abortion legal in those states that want it to be so, while backing the restrictions most people find reasonable. In the U.N., Haley was tough, standing against the world's worst tyrants. Those bad actors need to understand again the United States is not to be tested. She appears willing to pull America's head out of the sand on Social Security and Medicare. These essential programs are hurtling toward insolvency, and it is not helpful for political leaders to insist they can't be touched. Haley has the courage to consider raising eligibility ages and selectively reducing benefits. For those many Republicans who say they don't necessarily like Trump, but they like his policies, Haley is the answer. She embraces tax reform, but unlike Trump, would couple it with steep spending cuts. For all his talk about fiscal responsibility, the former president added roughly $8 trillion to the national debt during his four years. America can't afford another four years of that, no matter who is president. Haley would give Republicans a candidate not drenched in drama, and one who is not absolutely abhorrent to a wide swath of the electorate. Character matters. Trump is not an honorable person; he has no commitment to the truth and is willing to say or do anything to benefit himself. He's shown little respect for the rule of law. His attempts to cling to power after losing the last election reveal his willingness to destroy the nation's institutions rather than admit defeat. The former president is currently in courtrooms across the country defending himself against actions relating to his effort to cling to an office he lost. Polls indicate Trump's support in the polls would fall off considerably if he's convicted on any of the 91 criminal counts pending against him. Haley comes without the scandals and without the risk. And despite her struggles in the GOP primaries so far, Haley does better than Trump against Biden in the general election. The latest poll from NBC puts her advantage over the incumbent at 9%, while Trump bests Biden by 5%. There's nothing villainous about Haley. And she's not in her dotage. That alone should motivate a coalition of Trump-wary Republicans, Democrats fretful about Biden's electability and independents who share their concerns to get behind Nikki Haley. If they could carry her to victory in the Michigan primary, it might lead to a fulfillment of the electorate's expressed desire to avoid a Trump/Biden rematch this fall. Defeating Biden with a candidate who can competently lead the nation should be what motivates Michigan primary voters.","","",""

He rants and raves about Nikki Haley's campaign supporters but a new report from RealClearPolitics analyzed Donald Trump's FEC filings and revealed a long list of Democrat mega donors who actively funded candidates like Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton. ""While Nikki Haley was passing conservative policies as governor, Donald Trump was donating to liberals like Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris. Now liberal Democrats are returning the favor and funding his campaign,"" said Haley communications director Nachama Soloveichik. ""Donald Trump was a New York City liberal longer than he's been a so-called Republican. Turns out he's also the biggest hypocrite.""  Trump Bashes Haley But Has His Own Dem Mega Donors By: Phillip Weggman  Online here While former President Trump complains that a cabal of Democratic donors, Wall Street investors, and other elites are supporting Nikki Haley in efforts to deny him a third Republican nomination, some of his own wealthy backers roughly fit that same description. Not unlike the frontrunner before he entered politics, several of Trump's financial supporters have a long history of writing checks to Democrats or playing both sides, even as they are welcomed into the MAGA fold. It is not an unusual phenomenon in the Trump era, but contributions to the wrong Republican, Trump made clear last month, will land a donor on his naughty list. ""From this moment forth,"" he wrote on his website Truth Social, anyone backing Haley ""will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. We don't want them, and will not accept them."" Trump still accepts the support of former and current Democratic Party mega-donors, however. Timothy Mellon, the heir to the Mellon banking fortune, made two donations to the pro-Trump super PAC, Make America Great Again Inc., totaling $10 million in July and August of last year, according to disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission. At the same time, Mellon also cut sizeable checks in support of independent presidential candidate and former Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He gave $15 million to American Values 2024, a super PAC backing Kennedy. Trump will need as many independent voters and donors as he can get in a general election, especially as his legal troubles mount and billable hours from an army of lawyers accumulate. The former president's Save America PAC spent $47 million on legal services last year, according to public disclosures. In a Newsmax interview Friday, Donald Trump Jr. slammed RFK as ""a radical liberal who happens to be anti-vax."" While RFK could potentially eat away at Trump's support in the margins in a general election, Haley is the only one standing in the way of another GOP nomination. The Trump campaign attacked the former South Carolina governor last Friday in a press release, writing that she was ""funded by Democrats, Wall Street, and Globalists."" Exhibit A: Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and a longtime Democratic donor, who gave $250,000 to the pro-Haley super PAC, SFA Fund Inc. Trump isn't the first one to attack Haley over her donors. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis tried with limited success, arguing on the debate stage in December that ""Nikki will cave to those big donors when it counts."" He dropped out the next month after a poor second-place showing in Iowa and long after Haley had dismissed the criticism. She said DeSantis was ""just jealous."" Despite Trump's blacklist, Haley has still managed to put up impressive fundraising numbers. Her campaign announced a $16.5 million haul in January, nearly triple the amount she raised in the three months prior. Though his legal bills are an unwelcome expense, Trump remains a fundraising juggernaut. Running as both a former president and the leader of a grassroots movement, he raised $188 million last year across his campaign and various political groups, per a Wall Street Journal analysis. Some donors are like longtime friend Steve Witkoff, a New York real estate investor who donated $250,000 to Make America Great Again Inc. and testified on Trump's behalf in a Manhattan fraud case last year. Before Trump entered politics, Witkoff had been a longtime Democratic Party donor. According to FEC disclosures, he donated the maximum to then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2007. He also backed other New York Democrats, such as Rep. Jerry Nadler and Sen. Chuck Schumer, around that time and cut a $28,500 check to the Democratic Senatorial Committee. Since Trump became the GOP nominee, Witkoff has given almost exclusively to Republicans. Other Trump supporters, meanwhile, continue to donate to Democrats. Trump raised more than $5 million at a 2019 fundraiser hosted by Howard Lutnick in his New York triplex penthouse, and five years later, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald LP continues to support the former president. He donated $250,000 to Make America Great Inc. last December. The investor hasn't sworn off Democrats, according to a review of public FEC filings. Lutnick supported Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2016 presidential election and cut a $32,000 check to Sen. Chuck Schumer's leadership PAC that same year. His support of Trump has not tempered his spending on behalf of the New York Democrat who led the charge to impeach the former president. Lutnick has donated more than $20,000 to Schumer, including two donations to his primary and general campaigns for a total of $5,800. When asked about criticism of her Democratic donors, Haley campaign manager Betsy Anknney told RealClearPolitics that ""any of those hits from Trump are pretty rich considering his history. Trump campaign officials declined to address questions about their own Democratic mega-donors; instead, they lashed out at their last remaining GOP rival. ""Nikki Haley reeks of desperation as it's clear she knows she has no shot, and is now auditioning for a cable news contract when her 15 minutes are over,"" spokesman Steven Cheung told RCP. ""But not before she can squeeze every last dollar out of her Democrat benefactors."" One of those benefactors could have easily been Daniel Newlin, a personal injury lawyer from Florida, who donated to Clinton ahead of the 2016 election. He has also given tens of thousands of dollars to Florida Democrats, such as Rep. Darren Soto, as recently as 2022. But Newlin is backing Trump in 2024 ""because Donald Trump is the right man to become the next leader of the free world and do it in a way where the world looks at us like a champion."" Newlin donated $100,000 to Make America Great Again Inc. last December, in large part, he told RCP, because he feels Democrats ""specifically over the last decade, have become very, very far left."" Though an ardent supporter of Trump now, Newlin said he ""absolutely, 100% does not"" begrudge Democrats for supporting Haley, a candidate he described as ""an amazing woman"" and ""a champion."" ""Democrats that are supporting Nikki Haley, they're doing it because they feel like she can lead America,"" the Trump supporter said before adding that political support, at the end of the day, is a personal decision. ""We as Americans have to make our own decision,"" Newlin said, ""and the decision should really be based on this: Who's going to take the country back to global leadership.""

Ambassador Nikki Haley is using the border crisis to draw another contrast between herself and former President Donald Trump as she tries to cut into his 2024 Republican primary support while she still can. Haley, who had previously criticized Trump for encouraging congressional Republicans to block the bipartisan national security funding agreement and its immigration policy reforms, debuted another attack on the campaign trail Monday before South Carolina's Feb. 24 GOP primary. ""I will add the same year that we passed the toughest illegal immigration law in the country, Donald Trump contributed to Kamala Harris's campaign,"" the former governor said in Aiken, South Carolina, of her 2011 legislation. ""That's a fact."" Trump donated twice to Vice President Kamala Harris before he became a politician when she was a candidate running for California attorney general. He gave $5,000 to her in 2011 and another $1,000 in 2013. Meanwhile, in 2011, Haley enacted E-Verify statewide and made it compulsory for police to check the immigration status of anyone they stopped or arrested and suspected may be in the country illegally. During the same campaign event and a later stop in Spartanburg, Haley did scrutinize the Senate-led proposal for not reintroducing the Trump-era ""Remain in Mexico"" program, where immigrants await the outcome of their immigration applications outside the country, and for not triggering an emergency presidential authority that would permit President Joe Biden to severely restrict applications unless 5,000 illegal immigrants were encountered at the border in a week. ""We have to do it with the first person,"" Haley added in Aiken. Haley also expressed her disapproval of Trump's approach to the national security agreement during a separate appearance on Fox News. ""It's irresponsible to say that Congress has to wait until a general election because Trump is worried that he's going to lose,"" she told the network. ""There's a lot of reasons we gotta worry Trump's going to lose, but you don't sacrifice national security to do it."" Haley will be in California on Wednesday for fundraisers and a rally, promising to remain in the primary race until Super Tuesday on March 5, despite Trump's polling advantage. Her campaign announced Monday morning she raised $16.5 million last month alone.","","",""

She also cut taxes, cut regulations, and cut wasteful spending, making South Carolina a place businesses and families wanted to settle in,"" said Haley spokesperson Brittany Yanick. Haley's Economic Record  During Governor Haley's tenure 86,00 jobs were created in all 46 counties, 672 projects were announced, and $21.5 billion in capital investments were made.  When Governor Haley left office, there were more than 256,000 additional South Carolinians working than when she came into office. At the end of Governor Haley's tenure more South Carolinians were working than at any other time in history, and South Carolina was outperforming the national average.  Governor Haley cut the unemployment rate more than in half, from 10.8 percent to 4.4 percent.  Haley's policies moved 35,000 people from welfare to work through new training and work initiatives.  In June 2012, Governor Haley signed small business tax relief into law, reducing the small business tax rate from 5 to 3 percent.  Haley fought job-killing regulations that hurt small businesses, like burdensome training requirements for shampooers at hair salons; and she signed the South Carolina Brewery Bill, which allowed breweries to serve both food and alcohol.  Governor Haley prioritized ""holding the line on debt"" and South Carolina was appropriating twice as much in annual debt payments when Governor Haley came into office than when she left office.  In total, Governor Haley vetoed $459 million in spending from the state budget.  By the end of her tenure, South Carolina was the number two state in the country that people were moving to.","","",""

The Nikki Haley for President campaign released a new digital ad today highlighting Haley's long track record of combating illegal immigration when she was governor. The bill required police to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest for another reason and suspect may be in the country illegally and enacted E-Verify statewide. When President Obama fought Haley's E-Verify mandate, Haley fought back and won. For more on her record, watch the video here:    ""Nikki Haly passed one of the toughest immigration laws in the country when Donald Trump was still a New York City liberal donating to Kamala Harris.

""South Carolinians know she'll be tough on illegal immigration as president because she did it already as governor."" Haley's Record on Immigration As South Carolina governor, Haley signed one of the toughest anti-illegal immigration laws in the country. On June 26, 2011, Gov. Nikki Haley signed the South Carolina Illegal Immigration Reform Act, requiring police to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest for another reason and suspect may be in the country illegally. The bill required South Carolina employers to use the federal E-Verify system to check the citizenship status of employees.  The Post and Courier called these measures ""some of the nation's toughest measures to curb illegal immigrants living and working here.""  Haley went head-to-head with the Obama administration on illegal immigration.  Haley fought Obama's DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano to enforce South Carolina's E-Verify law. South Carolina filed a suit challenging Obama's constitutional authority after he issued an executive order giving temporary legal status to millions of illegal immigrants.  Haley fought the Obama administration on accepting Syrian refugees, undocumented minors, and Guantanamo Bay prisoners in South Carolina. As UN ambassador, Haley defended Trump's travel ban.  Haley defended Trump's travel ban on countries where there were serious terrorist concerns.  In April 2023, Haley visited 400 miles along the southern border and released a comprehensive plan to secure the border.","","",""

Ankney on January's major fundraising haul… ""We just released our campaign fundraising numbers for the month…$16.5 million raised in the month of January, with $11.7 [million] of that from digital and mail, and 70,000 new donors just in the month of January. So this was our biggest month to date, and bigger than our Q1, Q2, and Q3 fundraising quarters.""  Ankney on Nikki Haley's presence in South Carolina… ""[In the two weeks since the New Hampshire primary, Donald Trump] has held exactly zero events in South Carolina and did one media hit on FOX with Maria Bartiromo. In that same time, Nikki has held 11 events in South Carolina with thousands of people, she's done dozens of media appearances, including two Sunday shows, The Breakfast Club, and – of course – Saturday Night Live.""

Ankney on running against Grumpy Old Men who won't debate… ""We launched Grumpy Old Men, the series hitting both Trump and Biden. Both are confused, focused on the past, and won't debate. We are going to continue calling on Trump every day to man up and debate Nikki. The people of South Carolina deserve a debate, but it's understandable why he's hesitant to commit. He must genuinely be concerned that he's declining and he knows that Nikki is younger and sharper than he is. It's harder to lie about Nikki's record when she's there to punch back, and he'll have to answer questions about his record which is a lot harder than reading wild screeds off a teleprompter or sending out late-night all-caps tweets.""  Ankney on what's at stake for the GOP in November… ""Anyone who has seen a shred of credible data, who has been paying attention for the last eight years, or frankly has two eyes in their head knows that Nikki is the stronger general election candidate. The Trump team seems obsessed with proving that he can beat Biden, but the reality is, we've seen this movie before. When Trump took office in '16, Republicans had the House, the Senate, and the White House. In 2018, Dems had a net gain of 41 seats and we lost the House. In 2020, Trump not only lost the White House, but after hanging onto the Senate by the skin of our teeth, his antics in the aftermath of that election cost us two Senate seats in Georgia and majority control of the Senate. We know how this ends if Trump is the nominee. Republicans will lose. ""...And while Trump is spending $50 million on personal legal fees, Biden just booked five times that amount – $250 million – on air…The only way Republicans will get back to winning is if Nikki Haley is the nominee."" Ankney on Nevada this week… ""We have not spent a dime nor an ounce of energy on Nevada. We aren't going to pay $55,000 to a Trump entity to participate in a process that is rigged for Trump. Nevada is not and has never been our focus. I'm truly not sure what the Trump team is up to out there but they seem pretty spun up about it."" Ankney sets the record straight on Indiana... ""Many of you may have seen some of the hubbub...from Donald Trump. Look, this is more nonsense and confusion from Trump. We have more than enough signatures in each congressional district, and we will be filing this week before the February 9th deadline. So, I think any questions on that, you should be asking Donald Trump and Jim Banks whether they are simply confused, or whether they were intentionally lying and misleading people.""","","",""

Melvin, thank you for that introduction. And thank you, Congressman Steven Horsford, a great friend and an incredible leader of the Congressional Black Caucus. Where is he? There is he. Well, you know, it's been—he's been a key player in all this progress we're making. And so is Dina Titus. Where is Congresswoman Titus? There she is. And Senator Jacky Rosen. There you are, Jacky. All right. [Laughter] Look, let's be clear: We need to reelect Jacky. It's critical. And I'll start with the simplest message: From the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you. You all are the reason why I'm President of the United States of America. You're the reason. No, I'm—[applause]. You're the reason that Kamala Harris is a historic Vice President. And you're the reason that Donald Trump is a former President. [Laughter] And you're the reason—you'll make Donald Trump a loser again. In 2020, I ran because I thought everything this country stood for—everything we believed in, everything that made America ""America""—was at risk. I think people thought that maybe I was being hyperbolic about that. I'd say—they'd say: ""Joe, what do you mean our democracy is at risk? What do you mean we're in a battle for the soul of America?"" Well, they may not have understood it, but the people understood it. They don't say that anymore. Just think back to the mess Donald Trump left this country in. The pandemic was raging. The economy was reeling. And look how far we've come because of you. We vaccinated—[applause]. We vaccinated America to get through a pandemic. We created a record 15 million new jobs, getting this economy strong, more than any President has in 4 years. And right here in Nevada, 285,000 new jobs. And nationwide, Black small businesses are starting up at a faster rate of any time in 30 years. Latino small businesses are starting up as the fastest rate in over a decade. We passed the American Rescue Plan, which put $1,400 into people's pockets. And on top of that, they got a $300 check per child, per family, per month for hard-working families. Over 300,000—there were 380,000 families in Nevada benefited until the—our friends on the other side wiped it out. You know, nationwide, that's thousands of dollars that people put in their pockets to be able to get real crisis—to get through a real crisis. That cut Black child poverty in half. It cut—[applause]. It cut Latino child poverty by 43 percent. And it cut Indigenous child poverty by half as well. Look, I know—we know we have a lot more to do. Not everyone is feeling the benefits of our investments in progress yet. But inflation is now lower in America than any other major economy in the world—in the world. And in recent weeks, we're seeing real evidence that the American consumers are feeling real confidence in the economy that we're beginning to build. A recent Washington Post headline said, and I quote, ""Falling inflation and rising growth give U.S. the world's best recovery""—""the world's best recovery."" And we're just getting started. And let me tell you something else—who is noticing this: Donald Trump. [Laughter] The strange things he says. [Laughter] He recently said, ""When there's a crash, I hope it's in the next 12 months."" Isn't that wonderful—the former President to root for a crash? It's unbelievable. It's un-American. How can anyone, especially a former President, wish for an economic crash that would devastate millions of Americans? And by the way, pause for a minute. How many times did you hear, when I first got elected President, my policy—we're going to bring a recession next month? Every month. [Laughter] None of them are saying it anymore. The mainstream economists. Because of—I'm here because of you guys. Here's what it really means: Donald Trump knows the economy we built is strong and getting stronger. He knows that while it's good for America, it's bad for him politically. Trump also said the one President he doesn't want to be like was Herbert Hoover. Donald, I've got bad news for you, pal. It's too late. [Laughter] You're one of only two Presidents in American history—you and Herbert Hoover—who left office with fewer jobs than when you took office. Herbert Hoover—yes. Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. [Laughter] Look, when I got elected—I've been working my whole career as a Senator—long back with my old buddy Harry Reid and others—trying to get Big Pharma and the pharmaceutical companies to start to play it on the new level. And we have to beat them. They changed—they charge extraordinary prices, charging more for prescription drugs here in America than anywhere else in the entire world—made by the same drug company. You have a prescription for anything, take it to a local drugstore. I promise you, if I put you on a plane and took you to Toronto or Paris or Berlin or anywhere in Europe, you can buy that same drug, that same prescription for somewhere between 40- and 60-percent less. We said we'd beat them, and we did. Insulin—$35 a month for insulin for seniors on [with; White House correction] diabetes instead of $400 a month or more. We're also capping the cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year for seniors, even for expensive drugs like cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $15,000 year. Because of the progress we're making so far, 143,000 Nevadans will begin to save an average of $434 a year on prescription drugs. And, folks, I promise you, I'm just getting started. Our actions not only save patients thousands of dollars, they save taxpayers billions of dollars. You know, Medicare pays for these drugs that go out through—over—are being overcharged. Guess what it's saving the tax—the American taxpayer—what we've done so far? One hundred and sixty billion dollars that taxpayers don't have to pay to Medicare to give them these—[inaudible]. Republicans say they're concerned about the deficit. Give me a break. [Laughter] Give me a break. We've tried to make it $35 a month for everyone, not just seniors, but Republicans blocked us. And with your vote in 2024, we're going to make it happen for everyone in America, not just seniors. I promise you. And that will reduce the deficit by even more. Look, I promised we'd help eliminate the accumulated student debt. That—— Audience member. There you go. Yes! [Laughter] The President. ——that millions of Americans carried during the economic pandemic and beyond. The Supreme Court of the United States blocked me, but they didn't stop me. I found another way to help more than 3,700,000 people with $130 billion of relief and counting. There were several existing programs that the bureaucracy wasn't pushing, including one of the—it's called public servants, like teachers, firefighters. Public servants. So I fixed the program to deliver relief for public servants: teachers, nurses, firefighters, social workers, and so on. And guess what? Some of you are getting notices right now. You're going to get another student cut. [Laughter] And this time, you're going to not have any doubt about who sent it to you. It's going to have my name on it: Biden. No, I mean it, because we got another $25 billion a year. And guess what? It's—not only is it a good thing to do, it drows [grows; White House correction] the economy—it grows the economy. It's not costing people. Guess what? When you're able to eliminate that—how many of you have had your student debt eliminated? Well, some of you had student debt eliminated for over $100,000. Audience member. That's right! Right here! The President. Well, guess what? It changes everything. You were able to go out and buy your first home. You were able to go out and buy your first automobile maybe. You were able to go out and see to it that you have an opportunity to get up—to build that business you wanted. And I kept my promise as well to appoint the first Black woman to the United States Supreme Court. Her name is Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, and by the way, she's smarter than the rest of these guys. [Laughter] And by the way, I've appointed more Black women to the Federal Courts of Appeals than every other President in American history combined—combined. All told, with the help of the Senator from the State of Illinois, I've gotten 175 Federal judges confirmed. Two-thirds of them are women, and two-thirds are people of color. Hold a second there. I also said—when I got elected, I made a promise: I was going to have an American administration that looked like America. I have more women in my Cabinet than men. I have more African Americans on it. I have more people in the backgrounds that are similar. And by the way, I make no apologize—no apologies for being the most pro-union President in American history. Let me say one more thing. I also said that—I asked the Treasury Department to do a study with—raising the wages of union members, which I've been able to—I fought like hell to have happen, and it's happening. And unions are more popular now than they've been in generations. I said, ""What was—what's the effect of that?"" It raises everybody's wages. Everything raises, because guess what? When you're making more money for the job you're doing, you're the best workers in—we have the best workers in America—in the world. Look, remember those little computer chips that we were—we invented those suckers—about the size of the end of a fingertip? Guess what? You need 300 of them—three—to build an automobile. You needed them for cell phones. You need them for all kinds of things. And we had lost that market. We had lost that market completely. So I got in a plane, and I flew to South Korea. And they said, ""What the hell are you doing in South Korea?"" Well, they are a major manufacturer of chips. I sat down with their President and with Samsung. I said, ""Come and invest in America."" Because guess what? We now have $50 billion coming to America—investing in. And they're building these facilities. They built what they call ""fabs""—factories. They're great big—look like gigantic football fields underneath a roof. Guess what? Know what the average salary in those is? And you don't need a college degree. A hundred and twelve thousand dollars a year. And they're coming all over America. And thanks to what we call the bipartisan infrastructure law—it's a fancy way of saying we're building a hell of a lot—[laughter]—I've signed—that I signed, there are over 40,000 projects underway. Remember, the last President—he kept talking about ""Infrastructure Week""? [Laughter] He had ""Infrastructure Week"" for 4 years and didn't do a damn thing. [Laughter] No, but I'm serious. But guess what? We're doing a heck of a lot. In the State of Nevada, I just approved $3 billion for the Nation's first high-speed rail line. Three billion dollars. It's going to take you from here to Las Vegas—well, from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in 2 hours by train instead of 4 hours by car. At 186 miles an hour, it will also reduce carbon emissions. It will take 3 million vehicles off the road, helping the air quality. And it's going to create 35,000 jobs during construction, 10,000 union jobs—building trades: carpenters, electricians, ironworkers, laborers, and more. Jobs now and jobs beyond. And generating significant economic growth from Nevada to California, and that includes transforming California with another high-speed rail line coming down from the south, going through central part of the State. Guess what? There's—they're going to—that's train is going to go 220 miles an hour. Things are changing, folks. We have to get with the rest of the world. We have to—we're the best—we're the most innovative country in the world. What the hell have we been doing? [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Think about it. And look, just like Franklin Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act back in the thirties—he provided electricity for every home and farm because it was necessary. Electricity was the new need, and rural areas and poor folks couldn't afford it, so he signed the Rural Electrification Act. Well, we're bringing high-speed internet everywhere in America—because internet today is just as essential to doing business as electricity was then. So far, that includes nearly 270,000 households across Nevada that are paying less than $30 a month now for internet, instead of two to three times that amount, so children can do their homework, businesses are able to thrive, farmers and ranchers can know when the best time to sell their product is. And by the way, we're ripping out every poisonous lead pipe in America so every child—not a joke—so every child can turn on a faucet and drink clear water without worrying about brain damage. And guess what? It's creating thousands of good union jobs. And the one State I don't have to talk about gun violence in is here. I've been hearing the tragic times that occurred here in this State. We passed the most significant gun safety law in decades, but I want to make clear to you: I will not stop until I once again ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. There's no rationale for it. None, none, none. I mean it. I did it once when I was a Senator, and I will do it again. Look, we're saving the planet with the most significant investments in climate change ever—ever, anywhere, anytime, in the whole entire history of the world. And that includes, just in your State, an investment of $12 billion in clean energy provisions that—so you'll be a national leader in electric vehicles, batteries, and more, creating tens of thousands of jobs and generating significant economic growth. I signed into law a thing called the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws helping veterans exposed to toxic materials, and their families. It matters, and there's so much more we're doing that we can do with these folks. I've been saying for a long time—— Audience member. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. ——and I think it's—well, thank you. Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. Folks—— Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. Thank you. I've been saying for a long time, America has many obligations but only one sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm's way and to care for them and their families when they come home. It's a sacred obligation. So, when I introduced this legislation, well, a lot of my Republican colleagues weren't sure they wanted to vote for it. But guess what? I also included, from my generation, Agent Orange. How many people in the Vietnam generation had Agent Orange come down upon their heads, but they couldn't prove without a doubt that whatever their ailment was, was because of the Agent Orange? Well, guess what? What it should have been is what it is now, and the same way with burn pits. The burn pits out there where they burn—these pits are a size of a football field, 10 feet deep, 40 yards wide, and almost 100 yards long. And guess what? They burn everything in there, from jet fuel to body to—everything, all contaminated waste. And it generates—just like you saw what happened to those 9/11 firefighters. They all came out with cancer, many of them, because of the smoke they were inhaling. Well, the same thing happened. Matter of fact, I had a son who was the attorney general of the State of Delaware, and he should be here, not me. And guess what? He volunteered—he was attorney general, and he gave up his—active attorney general, and he said, ""I'm going with my National Guard unit,"" because they were going to go to Iraq. And he spent a year there. I was in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 19 times. And his hooch where he slept was only about 200 yards, maybe a little—maybe more, maybe 400 yards from where he slept, breathing in that air for a year. He came home with stage 4 glioblastoma, a brain cancer that there's no cure for. And he died—and he died. The idea that he'd have to prove it was because of that is bizarre. And guess what? Now anyone that's exposed to these burn pits, anyone who can demonstrate they were there, if they come down with the disease, it's covered. And if they—[applause]. And one other thing it means. It means if they passed away, their children are entitled to the education benefits and the other benefits they would have been if he'd been alive and come home—they'd been alive and come home. So, folks, look, the same way, as I said, with Agent Orange. Now, imagine the nightmare if Donald Trump is reelected. No—— Audience members. Boo! The President. No, no, no. And by the way, this is the guy who, when he was in France and he was—they asked him to go to this—a American cemetery in France from World War II where Americans were buried. And you know what he said? He said those folks buried in that cemetery were ""suckers"" and ""losers."" ""Suckers"" and ""losers,"" the guy said. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I'm not kidding. By the way, that's beyond—I'm glad I wasn't there. [Laughter] No, no, I'm serious. I shouldn't say that. But I'm glad I wasn't there. To call my son and your sons and daughters who gave their lives for this country ""suckers"" and ""losers."" That's how this guy thinks. Who the hell does he think he is? After a recent deadly shooting in Perry, Iowa, where two kids [people; White House correction] were killed—a sixth-grader and a school principal, what did Trump say? It wasn't long ago. He said, ""they've got to get over it."" ""They've got to get over it."" Audience member. We don't get over it! The President. Well, we're not going to get over it, we're going to stop it. And now Trump, from the beginning—and by the way, you all know there's no climate problems, right? [Laughter] I mean, think about it. Think about it. All kidding aside, think about it. This guy is denying we have a problem with climate. This guy is saying—and his MAGA Republican friends want to repeal the historic climate legislation I got passed. And get this, 100,000 Nevadans will get health care this year through the Affordable Care Act—and access to affordable premiums. But after trying and failing more than 60 times, Trump and his MAGA Republican friends are promising to get rid of the Affordable [Care; White House correction] Act again if they get elected. Audience members. Boo! The President. And by the way, it's the only reason why people all over this country have the protections for preexisting conditions—and they'll take it away. I don't know what they're thinking. I don't know what they're thinking. I really mean it. And seniors here in Nevada and all across America should know this: Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away their $35-a-month insulin, as well as the $2,000 cap on prescription drugs. How many of you believe the tax system is fair? Raise your hand. [Laughter] And even those of you who are doing well. We've made progress making sure the biggest corporations pay their fair share by paying a minimum 15 percent—just 15 percent. That paid for all the programs I'm talking about so far. And we did that, and we still cut the deficit $7 billion. But guess what? Trump passed, last time out, a $2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefiting the very wealthy and big corporations that expanded the Federal debt significantly. And now, instead of protecting Social Security and Medicare like I am, Trump and his MAGA friends want to give another billion-dollar—multibillion-dollar tax cut to the superwealthy and the biggest corporations. Look, I'm not antiwealth. I'm not anticorporation. I come from the corporate State of the world. [Laughter] Seriously. More corporations are incorporated in my State, as you know, Gov, than every other State in the Nation combined. But they've got to pay their fair share. I'm serious. Think about it. Look, folks, we—before the pandemic, there were 750—48 maybe—roughly 750 billionaires in America. Now there are a thousand. You know what their average tax rate they pay—the Federal tax rate? Eight-point-two percent. Anybody wouldn't trade that—for that tax rate? Well, let me tell you something. If in fact they paid their fair share, over the next 10 years, it'd be forty—$400 billion in new income coming in. We could take care of all these problems. We could have daycare for all kids. We could increase economic growth even more, et cetera. But Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away that opportunity. But I'm going to—if you reelect me—I tell you what, man—hang on, taxes. And I promise, not anybody making less than 400 grand would have one penny in Federal taxes raised. I kept that promise in the beginning. I haven't make—and I will not make—I will not break it again. But look, Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away your fundamental freedoms. Your voting rights are under attack: where you can register, how you can register, when you have to register, whether there's mail-in ballot, all the stuff they want to do to change the law. And now Trump is bragging about having overturned another basic freedom: Roe v. Wade. Audience members. Boo! The President. No—he's on television, and he's out saying, ""I did this because it's the Supreme Court that I appointed."" God love him. Well, Roe v. Wade has taken away a woman's right to choose. And by the way, now they're planning a national ban on the right to choose. They made it clear. If MAGA Republicans try to pass a national ban on the right to choose, I will veto it. And by the way, Kamala is doing an incredible job going around the country making this case. And here's the deal, folks. Here's the deal. The idea, if in fact you do what I hope you will do—we'll get more registered people—more people who are registered to vote between the—now and the general election, elect all the Democratic Congressmen and Senators all across the country, give me a Senate and a House, I'm going to bring back Roe v. Wade. And by the way, I love how Trump is now saying, ""Biden is for abortion on demand."" Not true. That's not what Roe v. Wade said. It said there are three trimesters and how it worked. Let me close with this. Look, Trump and his MAGA friends are dividing us, not uniting us; dragging us back to the past, not leading us to the future; refusing to accept the results of legitimate elections; and seeking, as Trump says, to ""terminate""—his words—""terminate"" elements of the U.S. Constitution. And you're telling me he doesn't—democracy is not at risk? Embracing political violence—never since the Civil War has any President engaged in or said political violence was ever appropriate—political violence in America. Calling January 6 insurrectionists—you know what he calls them? ""Patriots."" Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, no, I—no, I'm—I mean, think about this. People have pled guilty. You know, right after I was elected, I went to what they call a G-7 meeting, all the NATO leaders. And it was in the south of England. And I sat down, and I said, ""America is back."" And Mitterrand [Macron; White House correction], from Germany—I mean, from France looked at me and said, ""You know, what—why—how long you back for?"" [Laughter] And I looked at him, and the—and the Chancellor of Germany said, ""What would you say, Mr. President, if you picked up the paper tomorrow in the London Times, and London Times said, 'A thousand people break through the House of Commons, break down the doors, two bobbies are killed in order to stop the election of the Prime Minister.' What would you say?"" And I never thought about it from that perspective. What would we say that happened in another democracy around the world? Well, the whole world watched—the whole world watched. And what's going on? Well, guess what? It's not going happen. He's not—you know what's going to happen if he loses—and he's going to lose. You know, this guy has an interesting vocabulary. He calls immigrants ""vermin"" who ""poison the blood"" of the Nation. No—— Audience members. Boo! The President. It's hard to make this up. And he says they threaten our very democracy. He said—folks, we must make clear where we stand. Well, we have to make sure we stand for the truth and will defeat the lies. We must make it clear that in America, just like all of you do in Nevada, we still believe in honesty, decency, dignity, respect. Folks—— Audience member. You'd better win, Joe! Audience member. Get 'em, Joe! The President. Well, you're right—— Audience member. We love you, Joe! The President. Well, that's the reason I'm running, because we have to win. Audience member. Thank you! The President. No, no. I give you my word. We have to. It's not much of a choice here. Look, we're the most unique nation in the history of the world. I'll end with this. And that sounds like hyperbole, like Americans beating their chest, but we are. We're the only nation in the world built on an idea. Every other nation is built based on ethnicity, religion, or other common traits. The only—thing we're built on is that ""we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all women and men are created equal, endowed by their Creator,"" et cetera. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it before. We've never—we leave nobody behind in America. We believe everyone deserves a fair shot—just a fair shot. My dad used to say—and he'd say at the dinner table—my dad was a well-read guy who didn't get to go to college because of the war. And—but he'd come home before he went back to close the business he was manager of. And we'd have a conversation and, incidentally, eat. And he'd look and he'd say, many times: ""Joey, remember, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about being able to look your child in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" He meant it. We don't give hate any safe harbor in America. We believe in America. We know what the stakes are. We must keep the White House and keep the Senate by reelecting Jacky Rosen. And, folks, we have to win. We have to win back the House of Representatives and win it up and down the ticket—and State and locally. And that's why we have to get more people to register to vote after this primary—to do that—to do that in the primary. Anybody wondering, tell them—where they vote—go to iwillvote.com. And here in Nevada—here in Nevada—you'll know—you'll be given exactly where you vote. We have to must—we have to organize, mobilize, vote. When we do that, we'll be able to look back and say something few generations have ever been able to say. When American democracy was at risk, like it is now, you all saved it. [Applause] I mean it. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together. We're the only nation in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went in. And that's what we're going to do again. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. [At this point, music began to play. The President then resumed his remarks as follow.]  Every time—every time I'd walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan's house up in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandma—""No, Joey, spread it."" Let's go spread the faith, guys.","","",""

On Trump's legal chaos… ""He's got multiple court cases. I haven't necessarily kept up with them. I'm not a lawyer. I'm an accountant. I don't know the legal ramifications, but what I do know is one just came down. We just saw in his campaign disclosures he just paid 47 different law firms $50 million of campaign donations that came into his campaign. If you see that and he hasn't even gotten started on all these cases for the next year he's going to be sitting in a courtroom… I think it speaks for itself that he's [Donald Trump] saying he's going to be spending more time in a courtroom than he's going to be spending on the campaign trail. We've got a country in disarray and a world on fire. We need a president that's going to give us eight years of focus and discipline, not one that's going to be sitting there ranting about how he's a victim and how this isn't right and how this isn't just. He hasn't once talked about the American people and that's the problem I have."" On Biden and Trump's inability to lead the country…  ""You have 70% of Americans who have said they don't want Joe Biden or Donald Trump. Why are we doing this? Why are we allowing ourselves to have two 80-year-olds, who can't serve eight years, who both are diminished, whether it's in their character or in their mental capacity? Why are we doing this? We deserve better. America deserves better. I voted for Donald Trump twice. I was proud to serve America in his administration, but he is not the right person to lead us going forward. That's a fact. And I think you look at these court cases, you see how he's acting. All you had to do was see how he acted after I got 43% of the vote in New Hampshire. He was upset because he thought I was going to be down 25%. He threw a temper tantrum. Why? Because he wasn't controlling the situation. But he never talked about the American people. He never talked about the out-of-control spending and inflation. He never talked about how we were going to get kids reading again. He never talked about the border and the lawlessness. He never talked about the wars that were happening. He just talked about himself. That's the problem, this isn't about Donald Trump, this is about where we go in America.""","","",""

The ad, titled ""Grumpy Old Men Say What?"" is the first video installment of the campaign's ""Grumpy Old Men"" series against the two party front-runners. The over two-minute long spot features video of Biden seemingly mumbling during speeches and video of Trump mixing up Haley for former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and confusing Sioux City, Iowa, for Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The ad is the third part of the campaign, which launched earlier this week. The Hill was the first outlet to obtain the spot. ""Sixty percent of American families are living paycheck to paycheck, we've got an all-out crisis on the southern border, and wars blazing in Europe and the Middle East,"" Haley's national spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said. ""We need to know that our leaders are at the top of their game and these grumpy old men are not passing muster."" ""Nikki Haley is a new generational conservative leader with the strength, focus, and stamina to save our country,"" she added. Haley has been working to distinguish herself from Trump in the Republican primary as a newer face for the GOP, while using a similar strategy to contrast herself with Biden. Polls show the tactic could be working against Biden in a general election scenario. A Quinnipiac University poll released this week showed Haley trouncing Biden in a general election matchup, 47 percent to 42 percent. The Hill's Decision Desk HQ polling average shows Haley beating Biden by just over one point. However, Haley faces a tougher primary race against Trump.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/369460",8432,"Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Hello, Delaware! Can we please give it up for Julie, who is an extraordinary human? I have to tell you, I have worked with Julie for years, and she is someone who really just represents all that I know that we all stand for: about the people, about organizing, about coalition building, bringing people together, and the work that it requires around the clock. Julie, thank you for all of your work. And, Mr. President, Dr. Biden, the first Second Gentleman of the United States, my husband—[laughter]—I want to—I just—I have to tell you what joy Doug and I were feeling as we were coming into Delaware. And we were reflecting, Mr. President and Dr. Biden, on those days that we were waiting, as we all remember, for the announcement about who would be the next President of the United States. And this is a community that is so extraordinary in terms of the support that you give so tirelessly and so selflessly. And we know this is what it's going to take: all of us being here together, understanding that it is about all of us. The Senators are here. The soon-to-be-Senator is here. And this election, yes, it is about each of us asking of ourselves: What kind of country do we want to live in? That really is what is at stake. Knowing that we each have the power to answer that question. Yes, it is about our ticket. But it is about all of us. And I'm so proud to work every day with our President. I will tell you—[applause]—he is a son of Delaware. This is family. So I know you know what I'm talking about. But, for the sake of the cameras—[laughter]—let me just tell you something: Joe Biden, first of all, is fearless. When you look at what he has pushed through, in spite of the odds, that's the story of his life. But it is the story also of his Presidency. Joe Biden doesn't hear ""no."" Some people talked about ""Infrastructure Week"" forever. Joe Biden said, ""We're going to make it a reality."" So many of our young leaders know what is at stake in terms of the climate and what we must do to build up our ability in terms of adaptation and resiliency, bringing down greenhouse gas emissions, saving this beautiful planet God has given us. Joe Biden is the one, under his Presidency, that pushed through historic legislation, together with our Senators and so many of our friends in Congress. Joe Biden is the President who said—as he has always said—we're going to invest in science. He was the author of the Moonshot. And when he became President, it was about saying we're going to get a CHIPS and Science bill and invest in what we need to do to be a global leader on the challenges that face the world. And those are just a few of the things. But I have to tell you, it is a great blessing and privilege for me to work with him every day. Because he really, really cares. And you know, there is a certain perversion that has been taking place, I think, in our country by some to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. But the measure of our leader is based on who he lifts up. With the character of a true leader, which is someone who has a profound character of caring about the suffering of other people and then spending days and nights doing what he knows is possible to lift people up. And so it is my great honor to be with him and to introduce our President, Joe Biden. The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It's good to be home. You know what's really good about it, Kamala? These people know me, and they're still here. [Laughter] These are the folks, as that saying goes up in Claymont, who ""brung me to the dance."" [Laughter] Folks, you know, no one did more of that. I remember my sister coming home when we were starting to run for the Senate and said, ""I think you need some help."" [Laughter] This was back in 1990. No, I'm only joking. [Laughter] Hey, John, how are you? Nineteen seventy two. And she said: ""There's a guy named Ted Kaufman. Works for the DuPont company."" Ted, good to see you. One of my best friends in life and friend to my children. And it's great to see you, buddy. Or I should call you ""Senator"" because—[Laughter]. He's the only guy when I said, ""You've got to be Senator,"" he said, ""I don't want to be Senator."" [Laughter] Well, look, folks, you know, Doug and Kamala are here. I was hoping—you know, they came here, and I'm leaving from here to their home in Los Angeles. So, you know, it seemed kind of—kind of ass-backwards here. I—[laughter]. Well, look, I'm feeling good about where we are. I really am. You know, the folks are starting to focus in. And the guy we're running against, he is—he's not for anything. He's against everything. No, I mean it. It's the weirdest campaign I've ever been engaged in. It's even worse than—in terms of his behavior—than the last time in 2020. And you know, Kamala mentioned there's so much at stake. And you all, this crowd, really knows me extremely well. They know me too well. Don't tell everything you know, guys. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, the—I meant what I said back in—when we announced the first time for President against this guy, and we went up to legislative—up to Independence Hall and made a speech on democracy. And the press kind of thought it was a little bit of an exaggeration, except the American people didn't. The American people get it. They understand what's going on. And so this is a group of folks assembled in this room who are going to be able to say, God willing, that you helped—this generation helped save democracy. I mean in a literal sense. You have—and by the way, as I go around the world, which I do a lot, meet with other heads of state—because I've known them for so long, I'm engaged in the—Madeleine Albright was right. America is the essential nation. And they all look—all look to us, as my colleagues know. And every time I leave—not a joke—whether it's at the G-20, the G-7, wherever they are, they'll pull me aside, one at a time, and say: ""You've got to win. You've got to win. We can't afford—my country is at stake""—meaning their country. So there's a lot at stake here, folks. We have an enormous obligation. But you know, I think it's time to finish the job here. I think it's time for us to—[applause]. And if I don't stop talking, I'm going to get the hook from Jill. She's going to pull me off this little—[laughter]. But, folks, look, things are—people beginning to focus. They're beginning to focus, and the polling data—everything is picking up across the board. The new Quinnipiac poll, the national poll, has us beating him 50-44. Our neighbor State of Pennsylvania, the Susquehanna poll has us beating him 47-39. And another one in Pennsylvania, 42-37. And by the way, in New Hampshire, we weren't on the ballot. Couldn't campaign there. And guess what? We got 64 percent of the vote. So, folks, I'm going to put all of this away and just say: Thank you, thank you, from the bottom of my heart. I look out there and I see—Tommy, it's great seeing you, pal. I'm going to miss you. But I'm—you're not getting away. [Laughter] You're not getting away. And Chris is there all the time for me. And our soon-to-be-Senator-former-Congressperson. Your dad was incredible, by the way. And that woman behind you, that sister of yours, she ran my operation for a long time. [Laughter] She is the reason I was able to win the first time. God love her. But I look out and see so many of you. Gov, you're the best. Because, like me, you married way above your station. So, anyway, I—if I start naming everybody, I'll name everybody in here, including Vince D'Anna. Vinny, how are you, buddy? Good to see you, man. I haven't run a campaign without Vince giving me hell and helping me win around the way. Anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you. We've got a lot to do. And I think you all get it along with me: We can't—this is not just the campaign. This is more of a mission. We cannot—we cannot—we cannot lose this campaign, for the good of the country. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. It's not about me. It goes well beyond me. It goes about the country. And I think everybody knows it. And I think people are—beginning to dawn on people. And as long as I've got Ronnie Olivere still hanging out with me, I'm okay. [Laughter] So, anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. You're the best in the world. I'm going to hang out with you, if I can. Thank you, thank you.","","",""

She will be a strong president focused on fixing America's problems and a leader we can be proud of."" Around 67% of Americans indicated they were ""tired of seeing the same candidates in presidential elections and want someone new,"" according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. In that same poll, Trump bested Biden 40% to 34%. Trump is the overwhelming favorite to become the GOP standard bearer for the Nov. 5 election. The 77-year-old former president handily defeated Haley in both Iowa and New Hampshire by double digits. Trump has secured 32 delegates to Haley's 17. Polls show him with a yawning lead both nationally and in Haley's lightly surveyed home state of South Carolina. Haley has been barnstorming the Palmetto State, where she served as governor from 2011 to 2017, ahead of the Feb. 24 contest. She is hoping to pick up momentum against him there. In a recent Washington Post/ Monmouth University poll, Trump nabbed 58% support in South Carolina, compared to Haley's 32%. The 52-year-old has insisted that the race is ""just getting started"" and emphasized that she is the last major challenger to Trump still left standing. Trump's campaign shrugged off Haley's broadsides against the 45th president. ""Nikki Haley is a stone cold loser who is becoming more irrelevant by the day,"" Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told The Post. ""The more people get to know her and her Democrat ties, the more they despise her for being a fraud. It's clear she just simply does not have what it takes or the fortitude to stand up to Crooked Joe Biden."" On Thursday, Trump's campaign held an event featuring a slew of South Carolina Republicans who endorsed him over Haley, touting his grip on the party. Ahead of the showdown in South Carolina, Haley has tempered expectations, arguing that she doesn't have to win her home turf, but rather just has to ""show that we're competitive."" Haley's campaign had $14 million cash on hand by the end of last year as her Super PAC dries up, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Trump's campaign had more than $33 million cash on hand.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370339",3662,"By: Jennifer NassourOnline here Here's the least surprising news of the decade: Donald Trump has a woman problem. No, I'm not referring to his sordid personal life. I mean the women who vote. Here are the facts. In a Quinnipiac poll released this week, Trump had the support of just 36% of women. That's down five points in a single month. Joe Biden's favorability ratings are higher. That's saying something. Where'd the rest go? You guessed it: Joe Biden. A stunning 58% of women are ready to vote for him. And while Trump is losing ladies, Biden is gaining them, month over month. The gender gap is higher than it's ever been. The Quinnipiac pollster had the most understated line of the year: ""The gender demographic tells a story to keep an eye on."" No kidding. Every Republican should be looking at these numbers and freaking out. You know what happens when a Republican presidential candidate loses that many women? They lose the election. End of story. And a margin that big means a big loss. The kind of loss that sinks down-ballot races, from the House to the Senate to your local school board. The question is why. Why do so many women dislike Donald Trump so much? Those on the left can be expected to back Biden, of course, if for no other reason than abortion. But many independent and even Republican women will run from him, too. I'm a proud Republican — and a good case study. I have three daughters. I've spent countless hours trying to raise them right. You know what I've never tolerated? Rudeness, lewdness and disrespect. I've told them never to be like Donald Trump or to allow men to treat them like Donald Trump would treat them. Trump thinks he's a macho man, but in fact, he's a mean girl: He bullies. He lies. He throws temper tantrums. He trash-talks. He spends every moment either building up himself, tearing others down, or both at the same time. The thing about mean girls is they sow chaos everywhere they go. Donald Trump's no different. He's always breaking, never fixing. But after four years of him and four years of Joe Biden, America is already broken enough. We need a president who can put the pieces back together. The only way to do that is to earn the trust of enough women to win the election. Instead, Trump has chased away the very suburban women needed to swing the race. You know, the ones who used to vote solid Republican. We're talking women who want safe streets, good schools, reasonable prices and a booming economy for themselves and their children. They'll never get that under Joe Biden. But they dislike Trump so much, they'll still choose Biden over him. Or vote for neither. We need someone who can beat Joe Biden and bring America back. Someone who can win over women. That's why it makes sense to look to the only woman in the race: Nikki Haley. Unlike our former president, Haley is a case study in class. She fought the old boys club as governor of South Carolina and as ambassador to the United Nations. She's stuck to her conservative principles while expanding the tent. The polls prove it. While Trump has been running close Biden, Nikki Haley has enjoyed large leads over him. A CNN poll just put her a whopping 13 points ahead of Biden in a head-to-head match up. She dominates with suburban women. Fact is, despite what the media says, the race for the Republican nomination is far from over. There's still time for the party faithful to realize that Donald Trump has a woman problem that can't be solved. In fact, he has another woman problem: Nikki Haley isn't backing down.

The theme of the new campaign, which launches Thursday, is ""A Great Day in South Carolina.'' It highlights Haley's record as governor from 2011 to 2017 while also redoubling efforts to ""combat Donald Trump's lies."" The details of the new campaign were first obtained by CBS News. ""After defying predictions in New Hampshire, Haley will spend the next 23 days campaigning across the Palmetto State, reminding voters about her record of taking on the establishment and fighting for taxpayers over the political class,"" Haley spokesperson Brittany Yanick told CBS News. ""Good luck to Donald Trump if he tries to lie about Nikki's record. South Carolinians aren't buying it because it's a great day in South Carolina."" The new effort comes at a critical time for Haley, since her home state may be her last, best chance to convince voters and donors that she'd be a stronger GOP candidate in a general election matchup against President Biden than Trump and that a Trump ticket would also hurt Republican prospects in the Senate and House. A Monmouth University-Washington Post poll released Thursday shows Trump with a 26 point over Haley ahead of the South Carolina primary. The campaign will launch with a new 30-second-digital ad reminding South Carolina voters of her accomplishments during her tenure leading the Palmetto State. ""The great people of South Carolina know I cut their taxes, they know I signed the toughest illegal immigration bill in the country,"" Haley says in the ad. ""They know I passed voter I.D. and tort reform and ethics reform and they know we moved 35,000 people from welfare to work."" Haley's message in the ad highlighting her record is one she has been delivering in recent campaign stops across South Carolina on the heels of her loss in the New Hampshire primary last week and her third-place finish in Iowa the week before that. Haley is trying to persuade South Carolinians that she can replicate her successes as governor on the national stage.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370334",2952,"CHARLESTON, S.C. – The Nikki Haley for President campaign released the second installment of the ""Grumpy Old Men"" series, highlighting Donald Trump's refusal to debate Nikki Haley. Trump likes to say he is ""sharper than he was 20 years ago,"" and brags about his ability to ace a mental competency test. If that's true, why won't he debate Haley? Could it be that he is simply a grumpy, old man who doesn't want to answer the tough questions? Narrator: Yes. Keep reading for the top 10 reasons Donald Trump won't debate Nikki Haley. 1. Donald Trump doesn't want to answer questions about his recently proposed 10 percent tax on all Americans.    Donald Trump recently proposed a 10 percent across-the-board tariff, AKA, a 10 percent tax. That would cost every family an extra $2,600 per year on average. In a debate with Haley, he'll have to answer questions about why he wants to tax every American. 2. Donald Trump is confused.    Donald Trump 2024 is not the same Donald Trump from 2016 or even 2020. A week ago he accused Nikki Haley (four times) of being in charge of security on January 6. Uhhh… he might have meant Nancy Pelosi. 3. Donald Trump knows that every time he makes a mistake, Nikki Haley raises $1 million.    4. Donald Trump blew $50 million of his campaign money on legal fees. How in the world does he plan to beat Joe Biden with that kind of baggage?    5. Donald Trump is running a campaign based on revenge. The American people want to know how he will fix our country's biggest problems.   6. Donald Trump and the establishment want to coronate him even though only two states have voted. They're determined to bully their way through the nomination process.    7. Donald Trump performs much worse against Joe Biden than Nikki Haley. Nearly every reputable poll shows Nikki Haley trouncing Joe Biden in the general election while Trump barely squeaks by or loses. 8. Donald Trump is… unpredictable to say the least.  Trump's consultants can only do so much damage control when he goes off on a long rant during a rally or a 3 a.m. all-caps Truth tirade. Letting Trump loose on the debate stage for 90 minutes is a campaign's worst nightmare. 9. Donald Trump doesn't want to admit he failed to deliver on his signature campaign promises.    Donald Trump spent four years talking about building a wall, cutting spending, enacting a five-year lobbying ban, and so much more. He did not deliver. In fact, he increased the deficit by $8 trillion in just four years. He can keep piling up more promises, but the American people want to know: Where's the beef? 10. Donald Trump doesn't want to get called out for lying about Nikki Haley's record.    Donald Trump spent millions of dollars lying about Nikki Haley's record, but that won't work in South Carolina. South Carolinians know Nikki Haley delivered conservative wins from cutting taxes to protecting life to combating illegal immigration. They're not going to buy Trump's lies.","","",""

Supporting you is the easiest thing I've ever done. [Laughter] Not a joke. I was raised on GM. [Laughter] My dad managed a dealership—didn't own it; managed it. And in Delaware, we used to have the highest percentage of auto workers of any State in the Nation because we're a small State. We had the largest GM facility and the largest Chrysler facility outside of Detroit. And we—that's how we got through school. That's how we all made it. But look, folks, I'm going to be brief because I know you have been doing a lot of work here. First of all, thank you, thank you, thank you. You know, that old expression in a little town I grew up in in Delaware called Claymont, Delaware: You all are the ones that ""brung me to the dance."" [Laughter] And I never left you. I never left you. To me, it's a basic, basic thing. And I mean this sincerely. You know, Wall Street didn't build the middle class. Labor built the middle class. And the middle class built the country. Really. And when labor does well, everybody does well. No, no, I'm not just saying it. I know I'm the most pro-union, you know—anyway. [Laughter] We won't go into all that. But the reason I say it is true. I asked the Treasury Department to do a study on the impact of unions on wealth and society. The single biggest reason why we have—unions are growing, the single biggest reason why the economy is growing, because you are the best workers in the world. That's not hyperbole. No, you really are. You really are. And when labor does well, everybody does better. You even got nonunion shops a raise. [Laughter] They owe you. They owe you. Folks, look, this is—I'll—I'm going to go on a little—just a little bit more. [Laughter] There used to be a theory called trickle-down economics. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I mean it. Democrat and Republican Presidents adhered to it for a long time. It was that if the wealthy do very well, the whole economy will grow, and it will all trickle down. Well, not a whole hell of a lot ever trickled down on my dad's kitchen table. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Not a joke. And I've always believed, you give a—everybody an even shot at a job, they want to do it, they'll do it, and they'll do it well. And you are the best trained, you are the best workers in the world. I'll give you one example. I was in—I was—I decided that I had to do something in the first year because remember all those computer chips weren't available for the cars? There was—well, I got in a plane, and against the advice of many, including some my own folks—I went to South Korea, and I met with Samsung, and I met with the President of South Korea. And I said, ""Why don't you""—we used to have—we invented the damn chip. No, we did. We refined it. We used to have 40 percent of those chips we made. I said, ""Why don't you invest in America?"" He said, ""We're going to invest in America."" Invested $100 billion in America. Guess what? Excuse me—$50 billion invested by these guys. Well, I said, ""Why are you coming to America, Samsung?"" He said, ""Two reasons: One""—I give you my word—""you have the best workers in the world."" No, no, that's not a joke. The best in the world. ""And secondly, it's the safest place in the world for me to make my investment."" And, folks, look, we now have—in large part because of you and organized labor—the strongest economy in the whole damn world. We do. We do. In the whole world. Inflation is coming down. Jobs are growing. We created 800,000 manufacturing jobs. Remember they told us we were dead—manufacturing is dead in America and China was going to eat our lunch? Well, guess what, man? We don't taste that good. [Laughter] So, look, folks, I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And the whole country owes you. They really owe you. And I tell you a guy I owe. I owe this guy named Shawn. He stood up—he gets it. No, no, no. He gets it. He—come here. Come here. I really mean it. Because when we got all these numbers moving and we—and you guys endorsed me, he talked about a simple thing. He said, ""This is about giving people a shot."" That's all it is. It's just fairness, give people a shot. And that's what you do. That's what you do. And besides, you built my '67 Corvette. [Laughter] My pride. Any of you ever watch ""Jay Leno's Garage""? Audience members. Yes. The President. And watch me race on my '67 Corvette? It's only a 327/350. [Laughter] I tell you what, man, I got up to 130 miles an hour though. [Laughter] Secret Service doesn't like riding with me very much anymore. [Laughter] Anyway. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And you're not only helping auto workers, you're helping every worker in the world. You really are. You're the best workers in the world. That's not hyperbole. And I learned a long time ago—last comment I'll make—I've been doing this a long time. I know I only look like I'm 40, but I'm—[laughter]—right? [Laughter] Anyway, but—40 times two. [Laughter] But the thing is that, you know, there is a provision in the law that was passed during Roosevelt's time about—the big fight was the—could unions organize then. That was a big issue. It not only said unions could organize; it said we should encourage the union movement. That's what it says, the law. And it says one other thing. When a President of the United States is given money by the United States Congress to spend, whether it's on an aircraft carrier or a highway or any public event, they should do two things. One—this is what the law says—one, they should hire American workers. Two, they should use American products. And you can make an exception. If you didn't have a worker for a particular job or a product —or the material, you could hire somebody out. But guess what? For the longest time, we didn't pay attention to it. I pay attention to it. That's why we're growing. Made in America by Americans—that's why we're the best in the world. And you're the best. Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh, wait a minute. Come here, Gov. Come here, Gov. Turn—did they turn the mike off? [Inaudible] Governor Gretchen E. Whitmer of Michigan. No, it's on now. [Laughter] The President. I'm not going to turn the mike off when I've got the best Governor in the country standing next to me here. Senator, come here. And a great Senator as well. And a woman you'd never know before—she's very quiet. [Laughter] She never tells me her opinion bluntly, like: ""Joe, get the hell over here quickly. Move."" You know Debbie Dingell. She's a fighter for you all. She's a fighter for you. Participant. [Inaudible] The President. [Laughter] Your Lieutenant Governor—[applause]. If I get first pick for a team, he's my guy.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370336",2030,"CHARLESTON, S.C. – The fourth quarter FEC reports confirm what many have long known: Donald Trump is the weakest general election candidate Republicans can put forth. Democrats couldn't dream up a weaker candidate if they tried. Donald Trump isn't running a campaign. He's running a legal defense fund. Trump is spending buckets of money on his legal chaos, which will only grow more expensive in the coming months. Trump spent a stunning $50 million on legal fees in 2023 and $29 million in the last six months with plenty of shenanigans afoot. In an unusual move, he appears to have moved $30 million from his super PAC, MAGA Inc, to his Leadership PAC, Save America, so he can pay for his legal bills. Donald Trump performs terribly against the most unpopular incumbent in 70 years. All the reputable polls show Nikki Haley trounces Joe Biden in the general election while Trump barely squeaks by or loses. The latest Quinnipiac poll shows Haley beats Biden by five points while Trump loses by six. Haley beats Biden by 16 points with Independents while Trump loses by 12. Donald Trump's decline blunts Republicans' potent argument against Joe Biden. Joe Biden's infamous gaffes, confusion, and fatigue offer Republicans a potent electoral argument… unless they nominate another octogenarian plagued by similar confusion and chaos. Donald Trump is unhinged. From 3 a.m. all caps social media rants to a campaign based on vengeance, Trump gets in his own way more often than not. That's why his campaign consultants try to keep him hidden as much as possible. That's why he doesn't want to debate Nikki Haley. That's why nearly 70% of Americans don't want a Trump-Biden rematch. ""If you put in a factory order for the worst general election candidate ever, you couldn't dream up a weaker option than Donald Trump,"" said Haley communications director Nachama Soloveichik. ""From his legal drama and expenses to his growing confusion and temper tantrums, Republicans are begging for an electoral wipe out with Trump on the ticket.""","","",""

So, you know, the fact is this comes down to…Trump lost in 2018. He lost in 2020. He lost in 2022. How many times do we have to lose to realize that we've got to get this right? When we look at the situation, we will have a female president. It will either be me or it will be Kamala Harris. If you nominate Donald Trump as the Republican nominee, Joe Biden will win and Kamala Harris will become president. That's a fact."" Nikki Haley on Donald Trump's failed policies… ""He did a proposal for DACA and wanted amnesty. That happened while he was president. The same way he proposed a 25 cent gas tax increase per gallon when he was president. The same reason that you look at the fact that he supported and praised President Xi a dozen times after China gave the world COVID. There are multiple things you want to talk about. He had a good economy, yes, but at what cost? He put us eight trillion dollars in debt in just four years. Our kids are never going to forgive us for it.""   Nikki Haley on Donald Trump's hefty legal bills… ""I mean get ready to spend more campaign dollars on legal fees because those court cases have just started. He's got two in March and they go on for the rest of the year. It is unconscionable to me that a candidate would spend $50 million in legal fees. It explains why he's not doing many rallies. He doesn't have the money to do it. It explains why he doesn't want to get on a debate stage because he doesn't want to talk about why he's doing it. It explains why he had a temper tantrum, you know, the election night of New Hampshire is because he wants me out of the race and he wants to be the presumptive nominee so that all that cash starts going to him and he doesn't have to spend anymore."" Nikki Haley on Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce, and the conspiracy theories… ""I'm not gonna lie, I don't know what the obsession is. Taylor Swift is allowed to have a boyfriend. Taylor Swift is a good artist. I've taken my daughter to Taylor Swift concerts before. You know, to have a conspiracy theory of all of this is bizarre. Nobody knows who she's going to endorse.

By: Jazmine UlloaOnline here Two curmudgeonly old rivals, reclusive spendthrifts, are marching toward a showdown that a lot of people really wish wasn't happening. If that is the plot of a slapstick comedy, it's also the latest knock from Nikki Haley on former President Donald J. Trump and President Biden as she fights for oxygen ahead of the Republican primary in South Carolina on Feb. 24. In a new series titled ""Grumpy Old Men,"" the Haley campaign on Wednesday plans to start unveiling online videos, digital ads and voter emails that will underscore the ways in which Ms. Haley has argued that the two party front-runners are alike. The episodes, with titles like ""Stumbling Seniors,"" ""Basement Buddies"" and ""Profligate Pols,"" take shots at, among other things, her rivals' signs of mental confusion, their light presence on the campaign trail and their economic policies leading to high inflation. The push is part of a shift in strategy that Ms. Haley began after the Iowa caucuses, casting Mr. Trump, 77, and Mr. Biden, 81, as belonging to the same bygone era of politician, one she says is deeply at odds with the country's needs. It also follows her more aggressive posturing toward Mr. Trump as the two head into a heated face-off in South Carolina, the state where she was born and raised, and which she led as governor. But the series, with its reference to a movie from 1993, could prove a risky bet as she looks to court a Republican base that is largely graying, white and Christian. Polls show her trailing the former president by double digits in her home state. Attacks on Mr. Biden's age did not play well during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. Ms. Haley, 52, who served as a United Nations ambassador under Mr. Trump, has consistently pitched herself as a ""new generational leader"" for her party and called for mental competency tests for candidates who are 75 or older. Yet, until recently, she has taken a careful approach toward both men and their age. Her most pointed attacks on the issue have been against Mr. Biden, though she often tells her audiences that she is not being disrespectful. ""We all know 75-year-olds that can run circles around us,"" she often says on the stump, ""and then we know Joe Biden."" She has been even less inclined to go after Mr. Trump. She directly criticized him as being in mental decline for the first time only this month, after he appeared to confuse her for Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker. Days later, and just hours after the polls opened for the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23, she told reporters that she believed he was ""mentally fit"" to be president. But she has nevertheless ramped up her critiques of his mental acuity. On Saturday in Mauldin, S.C., she called his reaction to her momentum in New Hampshire ""totally unhinged."" ""Nearly 50 percent of Republicans and 70 percent of Americans don't want to watch grumpy old men stumble across America when our country is on the brink and the world is on fire,"" Olivia Perez-Cubas, a spokeswoman for the campaign, said in a statement.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370433",4667,"By: George F. WillOnline here Until Feb. 24, the geography of 2024's presidential politics will suggest a satisfying symmetry. The first state that voted for secession can put the nation on a path away from today's political vitriol — the worst since the 1850s. A South Carolinian who lives here, 27 miles from the Charleston harbor fort at which the Civil War's first shots were fired, is neither in a surrendering mood nor short of ammunition. South Carolinian truculence threatened the nation's unity 163 years ago. Today, that trait has the state's former governor Nikki Haley, a self-described ""street fighter in heels,"" spoiling for a fight. Almost the entire Republican elite, in Washington and in this state, is prostrate before Donald Trump, the supposed populist scourge of the ""establishment."" She is, however, approved by 76 percent of this state's voters. They remember that Haley earned the enmity of the state's political establishment by enforcing transparency: Before she did, only 8 percent of House and 1 percent of Senate decisions were by recorded votes. This state's voters also might reasonably resent Trump's apparent belief that her continuing candidacy is an affront to his grandeur. And his impertinence that their primary election is a nullity, given his inevitability. Calling herself a ""happy warrior,"" looking inexplicably rested and exuding an exuberant pugnacity, she is wagering that Trump cannot keep his composure for four weeks. And that a majority of voters, already embarrassed and exhausted by Trump, will be more so if he has a testosterone spill when she relentlessly needles him about being afraid to debate someone with two X chromosomes. President Biden's handlers cannot allow him out campaigning for nine months because they know what voters will see. Trump's operatives cannot know what he does not know: what he will say next. One of Haley's tasks is to trigger him. In South Carolina, independents can vote in either party's primary. Many of them — especially independent suburban women, who are apt to be decisive in November — are weary of behavior from Trump that they would not tolerate from their children. A British diplomat, one of Theodore Roosevelt's close friends, when asked to explain TR, said: You must understand that the president is about 6 years old. The ambassador was referring to TR's overflowing enthusiasm, energy and curiosity. Trump only has a 6-year-old's defects: lack of impulse control, and a penchant for infantile insults — e.g., referring to Haley as ""birdbrain."" Laughing at him might not be Haley's preferred mode of attack. Voters, however, are in no mood for policy speeches, such as the one she gave at the Hudson Institute in 2020 — a luminous defense of economic freedom against the statism, corporatism and protectionism that make Biden and Trump kindred spirits. For perhaps the first time in U.S. history, and certainly for the first time in modern polling, voters' concerns about immigration — Biden's chaos at the border — eclipses all other issues, including the economy. This fact. And Trump's weirdness. (Between his inauguration and his expulsion from the platform, he tweeted 26,237 times — about 18 times a day). And his increasingly erratic behavior under the pressure of his legal difficulties. And Haley revealing his manifold insecurities. All these facts require her to run a MANA campaign: Make America Normal Again. Trump's electoral weakness is as obvious as is the probability of a Haley landslide against Biden. Trump was weaker in the Iowa caucuses (51 percent) than in the 2020 election in Iowa (53 percent). He won just 30 percent of independents in New Hampshire, where 21 percent of voters in the Republican primary said they would not support Trump in November. In 21 coming Republican primaries, including 11 of the 15 on Super Tuesday (March 5), voters do not have to be registered Republicans. South Carolinians, remember this: In 2020, Trump lost the suburbs by 10 percent. And 6 percent more women than men voted. And Biden carried women by a larger margin than Trump carried men. Why would anyone consider Trump a stronger candidate than Haley against Biden? This is a cliché: It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness. This is a fact: Haley is the last candle fending off darkness. Many South Carolinians are eager to snuff out Republican competition by supporting Trump. Do they wonder why Biden, too, ardently wants Trump's nomination guaranteed immediately? If, however, South Carolina prolongs the nominating process by supporting Haley, there will be time for pleasant Republican surprises and sudden Democratic forebodings.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370434",4085,"CHARLESTON, S.C. – This afternoon, Nikki Haley joined America Reports and Newsmax to discuss the Iran-back attack against American troops, defunding UNRWA, and Donald Trump being too afraid to debate. Haley on FOX News    On Biden's weak response to attacks on Americans:  ""This is 160 strikes. As a military spouse this is what we fear, when our loved ones are overseas if you're not taking care of them that something like this happens. This is not about hitting Iran hard. This is about hitting Iran smart. I don't know what Biden is waiting on, he has got to strengthen those sanctions. When he loosened them, he allowed billions of dollars from China to go into Iran when they imported oil. You've got to take away the money from Iran because that takes away the money from the proxies. That's the first thing they need to do. The second thing they need to do is to go and take out any of the production sites that are allowing them to do this in Iraq and Syria that they're coming from. And then the third thing is you have to figure out which Iranian leaders are making the decisions and you take them out. This isn't about hitting Iran. This is about being strategic and smart about what you do take out. When you do that, you're taking away their capabilities of hurting more American soldiers."" On hitting Iran:  ""He needs to go after the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC. He needs to go after the leadership there, those that are making the decisions. That's what leaves them flat-footed. Find one or two of them that are making the decisions. It will chill all of them when you do that. They don't necessarily care if you take out all of their equipment and their weapons. They don't care if you take out any of the proxy fighters because they'll just add new ones to it. What they do care about is when you touch their money or you touch their leadership. That's what gets Iran's attention."" Haley on Newsmax   On funding UNRWA:  ""Not surprised at all. It is why when I was at the United Nations I cut off all US aid going to UNRWA because we saw in the schools, the textbooks, they were spreading terrorist conversations. It would say if you have five Israeli soldiers and you kill three Israeli soldiers how many Israeli soldiers do you have left? That's what the textbooks were. We knew that the people working in UNRWA were helping all of the terrorist projects. You could see it. And so we stopped all US aid going. The world condemned us over it. I said, well, if the Arab countries care so much, they can pay for it. Why does the U.S. have to pay for it? And look at what happened. This is absolutely no surprise. Biden went and started giving money back to UNRWA and he can sit there and say he actually was part of the problem as to why this happened to Israel in the first place."" On Trump surrounding himself with the political elite:  ""I've never been part of the political elite. I don't want to be a part of the political elite. The people who are saying that are the congressional members around him, the Lindsey Graham's of the world, and everybody who's got nothing done on cutting wasteful spending, nothing done on the border, nothing done on preventing war. They've done nothing. So Donald Trump has surrounded himself once again by people who have done nothing and will do nothing. What I'm saying is it's time to start listening to the American people. 75% of Americans have said they don't want a Trump-Biden rematch. The majority of Americans both say they disapprove of Trump and Biden. We are $8 trillion in debt in four years because of Trump. He needs to start answering. It's why I've said he's got to get on a debate stage. Answer the question about why you put us that much in debt. Answer the question on why you now want to raise taxes on all Americans by putting a 10% tariff. That's anything from baby strollers to appliances. You've got to answer that. Answer why you went and praised China's President Xi a dozen times after China gave us COVID. There are too many questions for him not to get on a debate stage and answer.""","","",""

Trump's proposed 10% tariff on U.S. imports is a 10% across-the-board tax on all Americans. It will make the items middle-class families rely on—everything from baby strollers to appliances—more expensive, costing households $2,600 in new taxes in a single year. Americans are already paying sky-high prices thanks to Biden and Trump's inflation. They don't need another tax on top of that.   On Trump's 10% tax:  ""Now I'm telling the truth about him. This is a man that put us $8 trillion in debt in just four years. Think about that. This is a man who praised China's President Xi a dozen times after China gave us COVID.

But that night in New Hampshire after the court case, he's never once talked about the American people."" On Trump's reckless spending: ""You know, he didn't do anything that much different than Biden. He paid off people to get votes. You know, we saw it when he gave out the COVID stimulus checks, the same way we see Biden going and throwing out all this money. What I would do differently, everything you do with the economy, should be how to get people less dependent on government. You look at the economy, look at the economy under Trump. Yes, it was good, but at what cost? Look at the economy now under Biden. Everybody's talking about how good it is, but look at how government has grown. That's what you don't want… I'm going to be honest with the American people. We've got to let the American people know that what Donald Trump's about to do to you is going to raise every household expense by $2,600 a year. They're going to raise it, they're going to raise the cost of anything from baby strollers to appliances under Donald Trump. Middle-class families can't afford that."" How Haley would handle the Iran-backed attack on U.S. troops in Jordan: ""Military families want to know their loved ones are protected. Biden didn't protect them. And there have been 160 strikes. There shouldn't have been one. There shouldn't have been two. And you've got 160 and you've got dozens injured. We lost three heroes because Biden was scared of his own shadow… There would be no Hamas without Iran, Hezbollah without Iran, or Houthis without Iran… You go after wherever those missiles are, the production, wherever it is in Iraq and Syria, you take that out. Wherever it is in Lebanon that they're doing that, you take that out. You go after the leaders making the decisions. It's not after Iran, the country. It's after the people who are making these decisions. When Soleimani was assassinated, it sent a chill up their spine. It took their breath out. You have to be strategic. It's not starting war, it's actually preventing war.""","","",""

I’ve worked alongside governors, senators, congressmen, state legislators and other leaders to make South Carolina a better place to live, work and raise a family. The strongest leader I’ve worked alongside was Gov. Nikki Haley. When South Carolina was in crisis and desperate for a leader, Gov. Haley stood in the gap time and again and held our state together. Whether it was a 1,000-year flood, a mass shooting, economic turmoil or South Carolina’s domestic violence surge, Haley led with moral clarity and compassion. She never failed to show her strength. I watched Haley lead in both public and private as governor. I believe the rest of America is beginning to catch on to what I have known for quite some time — Haley must be the next president of the United States. Gov. Haley and I worked together to help women suffering from domestic violence. Together, we pushed for the Domestic Violence Reform Act, sending a message that South Carolina prioritized strengthening survivors over the convenience of abusers. The law enacted harsher penalties for offenders and an education program for students. We increased funding to ensure each domestic violence case was prosecuted by a licensed attorney and did a complete overhaul of the entire system. Just as importantly, Haley used her leadership position to combat the cultural stigma that too often prevents victims of domestic violence from coming forward and seeking help. In just two years, South Carolina made major strides in combating domestic violence, taking the state off its first-place pedestal for domestic violence homicides for the first time in many years. With Haley at the helm, South Carolina prioritized safety and security for all citizens. Haley’s commitment to justice and steady leadership didn’t stop there. When, in a matter of months, a white cop shot a fleeing black man multiple times in the back and then a white supremacist murdered nine innocent people at Mother Emanuel Church, South Carolina was rocked. I watched Nikki Haley stitch our heartbroken state back together. The governor and I worked side-by-side during these prosecutions. Haley’s commitment to justice never wavered. With Haley at the helm, our state didn’t have riots, we had vigils. We didn’t have protests, we had hugs. During our state’s most painful moments, Haley helped our state move forward while other states facing similar crises were ripped apart by violence. In all my years watching the leaders of our state come and go, Nikki Haley stands out for her grace and grit. Haley’s principled and strong leadership mended our state, and that makes me hopeful for what she can do for America. Our country is divided. We need a leader who doesn’t create chaos. We need a leader who inspires the best in people and gets results. I know Nikki Haley is that leader. Scarlett Wilson is the 9th Circuit solicitor.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370437",4260,"GREENVILLE, SC – After holding a rally with 1,500 voters last night in Mauldin, S.C., Nikki Haley spoke with Meet the Press’ Kristen Welker about the state of the presidential race, Donald Trump’s temper tantrums, the border crisis, and her support for Israel.   On fighting the political elite:  He can't bully his way through the nomination. I think that it's not surprising that he is surrounded by the political elite, but let's keep in mind the political elite has got nothing done for us in stopping the wasteful spending, has got nothing done to secure the border, has got nothing done to keep us more safe as we see wars around the world. And so, look, that's exactly what we don't want. The reason the political elite are upset and the members of Congress are upset is because I've pushed for term limits. I've pushed for a mental competency test. I've said if they don't get a budget out on time they shouldn't get paid. I have fought this political class my entire life and I'd much rather be fighting for the people than fighting for the elected officials in DC. On Trump being unhinged:  He's just going to become more unhinged, Kristen. Hold on. It's going to get worse. Because that's what he does when he feels like he's not in control. On Trump being distracted:  I've always said I trust the American people. They know how to make good decisions. And so I think that they're going to see this for what it is. They see that he's completely distracted. They see that he's going on these rants about how he's the victim. And I think that's exactly what we don't need a strong leader to be. And so these court cases are going to keep happening. One by one we're going to keep seeing him in a courtroom and we're going to see him come out and do a press conference. That's not what you want a president to be. On Trump’s insecurity:  I laugh every time I see one of his tweets, every time I see him throw a temper tantrum because I know Donald Trump very well. When he feels insecure, he starts to rail, he starts to rant, he starts to flail his arms, and he starts to get upset. When he feels threatened, he starts to throw all kinds of things out there. I would always tell him he was his own worst enemy. He's proving that right now. He proved it in the fact that he continues to be chaotic. Those things don't hurt my feelings. This is not personal for me. What is personal for me is getting America back on track. On Hamas:  When I was at the United Nations I gave a speech five years ago and it told the world that there were maps. These maps were held by Hamas and it showed that if they could break through the barrier this is how they were going to kill as many Jewish people as fast as they could. That happened. I know there would be no Hamas without Iran. I know that they want to eliminate Israel. We've got to find a way to protect Israelis and get those hostages home. This may work. We have to see, but what we also have to do is not take our eyes off of Hamas because they're going to use this time to kill more people and do more things to build up their military. On the border crisis and a proposed border deal: My message to Republicans is do not leave D.C. until you finish the job. We have waited for so long for Congress to do something about the border. First, Joe Biden should be securing the border. This is a national security threat. The idea that he is actually suing Governor Abbott for trying to protect the people of Texas is wrong. America is acting like it's September 10th, and we better remember what September 12th felt like, because it only takes one person to cause a 9/11 moment. The second thing is Republicans and Democrats need to get into a room. They don't need to leave until they figure this out, because the American people are not safe at this point. And Donald Trump, the last thing he needs to do is tell them to wait to pass a border deal until the election. We can't wait one more day, but they do need to get this right. I don't know exactly the details in the bill, but one of the things I saw is that they didn't have the Remain in Mexico policy. You have to have the Remain in Mexico policy because people don't even need to step foot on U.S. soil. That's the first place we need to start.","","",""

The Trump campaign wanted that formal designation bestowed but reversed course after several members of the party's governing body called it undemocratic, given that 48 states have yet to cast primary or caucus ballots. ""I should do it the 'Old Fashioned' way,"" the former president posted on social media, ""and finish the process off AT THE BALLOT BOX."" That's progress: Mr. Trump wants voters, not an angry mob of his supporters, to decide an election. Apparently, he saw that it would have been politically unwise, even within the party he dominates, to so blatantly short-circuit the nominating process, in which he has thus far received 232,652 votes from Iowa and New Hampshire, earning 32 of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the nod. Still, the machinations inside the RNC reflect the degree to which Mr. Trump has emerged as the boss of a new party establishment, having vanquished the old guard against which he waged political war for the past eight years. The last opponent standing in his way is former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who is determined to contest the primary on Feb. 24 in her home state. Mr. Trump, brushing aside her accusations that he is ""totally unhinged,"" refuses, insultingly, to debate the woman he calls ""Birdbrain."" To be sure, debate avoidance is standard operating procedure for front-runners. If he were really so confident of his intellectual superiority to a rival whom he once admired enough to appoint as his ambassador to the United Nations, however, Mr. Trump would relish the chance to debate. Such a clash would certainly serve the Republican Party, and the country as a whole, by focusing attention on the degree to which Ms. Haley's accusations about his fitness for office have merit — as well as on the significant policy differences between the two. A debate with Ms. Haley would force Mr. Trump to explain his proposal for a 10 percent tax on all imports, essentially a $300 billion annual tax increase, and why he allowed the national debt to grow $7.8 trillion during his term. Mr. Trump has demagogued Ms. Haley for acknowledging that the retirement age needs to be raised for younger people to save Social Security from insolvency. Abortion is a vexing issue for both candidates. Ms. Haley said she'd sign a six-week ban if still governor but calls for ""consensus"" at the federal level because Republicans won't have 60 senators to overcome a filibuster. Mr. Trump takes credit for appointing justices to overturn Roe v. Wade but won't commit to supporting a federal abortion ban. Ms. Haley opposed Democratic efforts to eliminate the filibuster, but Mr. Trump pushed Republicans to do so during his presidency. Arguing over the filibuster might sound esoteric, but it's hugely consequential if Republicans win the White House and both chambers in November. Mr. Trump recently mocked Ms. Haley for her botched answer to a question about the cause of the Civil War. ""I'd say slavery is sort of the obvious answer, as opposed to about three paragraphs of bulls---,"" Mr. Trump said this month. The next day, talking out of the other side of his mouth, he bizarrely insisted that he, unlike Abraham Lincoln, could have averted the conflict through negotiations. As governor, Ms. Haley took down the Confederate flag flying on State House grounds after a 2015 white-supremacist massacre of Black churchgoers in Charleston. Two years later, amid violence in Charlottesville, Mr. Trump opposed removing Confederate monuments. We'd like to hear the two of them explain themselves regarding all of the above. Ms. Haley says she believes climate change is caused by human activity. As governor, she helped coastal communities adapt to more frequent flooding caused by more intense storms. But Mr. Trump has called global warming a ""hoax."" Republicans rallied behind Mr. Trump last year as he was indicted on 91 counts in four cases, widely perceiving these prosecutions as politically motivated. But a jury awarding $83.3 million in damages on Friday to E. Jean Carroll for defamation pointed to risks the GOP assumes by coronating Mr. Trump and offers a rationale for Ms. Haley to keep running. Mr. Trump has been willing to face his accusers in court, even when he's not required to show up. Why won't he face Ms. Haley on a debate stage?","","",""

Trump (1st Term), Remarks at a Campaign Rally in Las Vegas, Nevada Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374953",69107,"TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. CROWD: Trump, Trump, Trump— TRUMP: [cheers and applause]. Thank you very much. Thank you. And you know outside, I don't know if you know what's going on. There's—this place is packed. There's more people outside trying to get in. So, if anybody wants to leave, please leave. Does anybody volunteer to leave? No? No, we have close to 3,000 people outside trying to get in on top. So thank you very much, and thank you, Michael. I'm thrilled to be back in Las Vegas with thousands and thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. That's what you are. [cheers and applause]. As you know, two weeks ago in Iowa, we had a great time in Iowa—40 degrees below zero. We won the Iowa caucuses by the largest margin in the history of the caucus. Thank you. Thank you. Very enthusiastic people. No, they're friends. They're friends. CROWD: USA, USA, USA- TRUMP: Thank you. No—they're actually friends, enthusiastic friends. Then earlier this week, we had a spectacular victory in New Hampshire. We shattered the all-time record for the number of votes cast from either party. It has never happened in the entire history of the New Hampshire primary. We got the most votes ever gotten by anybody. That's a good sign, and I'm proud that we're the first non-incumbent— remember this, look at this, in either party to win both— think of this, Iowa and New Hampshire. We won them both quite easily. [cheers and applause]. Thank you. Now we're going to have an even bigger victory right here in Nevada, perhaps the most astounding of all as we achieved our monumental victory in New Hampshire, despite the fact that more than 50% of the voters were not even Republican. You know, they were Democrats and Independent. That was a setup and we still won by a record margin, over 70% of the votes cast. Oh, wow. I didn't even know this fact. Did you hear this? 70% of the votes cast for Nikki Haley. Did anybody ever hear of her? Bird brain [booing] Nikki. You know the—the Republican Party wanted to nominate me and just say, skip the whole thing, and we're just going to give you our nomination. I said, don't do that. Don't do that. I want to win it the fair way. Pretty easy way too because we're leading by so much. But over 70% of the votes cast for Nikki Haley on Tuesday came from outside of the Republican Party. They came from outside. It came from outside. She got about 24%, 25% Republican votes because they had liberals interfering on her behalf. They had Democrats voting. They had everybody voting, and we still won by a lot. That was the one shot. The message from the voters of our party is clear. It's time to finish this primary and get going and defeating. And you remember this, we all call it a primary, but I like calling it a caucus because it really is. Your primary vote doesn't mean anything. It's your caucus vote. So, in your state, you have both a primary and you have a caucus. Don't worry about the primary, just do the caucus thing. We're going to go on to defeat crooked Joe Biden, and we're going to, very simply, make America great again. Make America great again. [cheers and applause]. So it's very important to remember that you have a big thing coming up. Don't waste your time on primary. Waste all of your time on caucus and because the primary doesn't mean anything—it's psychologically maybe a little bit, about 2%, but it doesn't mean anything. With the help of everyone here today, we're going to secure a gigantic win in the Nevada caucuses on Thursday. So, it's Thursday, February 8th. Right around the corner this November. And we do want to get a good vote. We're not going to have a lot of competition, I think. But it doesn't matter. We want to get a great beautiful mandate. And this November, we're going to win the swing state of Nevada. You ever think of it as a swing state? And we're going to keep the House, and we're going to take back the Senate. We're going to get a lot of great talented people here. We're going to also take back that beautiful—isn't it one of the most beautiful places in the world? The White House. The White House. Victory cannot come soon enough. Under crooked Joe Biden, our country is dying. Our country is dying. Our border's open and gushing. It's a big gushing wound letting drugs, crime, and millions upon millions of illegal aliens pour into our country like we've never seen before. Nothing like this has ever happened to our country before. It's also the number one place on Earth for a thing called human trafficking, number one place. Our border has become a weapon of mass destruction, our destruction. It's a weapon of mass destruction. It's our destruction. We're destroying our country. As I've been saying for so many years, this is an invasion. It's an invasion of our country. On behalf of all Americans who want a strong and secure border, I want to express our thanks to Governor Greg Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick and the great state of Texas where we, right now, have about a 40-point lead for rightly invoking the invasion clause of the U.S. Constitution. It is an invasion. But we didn't need to do it just three years ago. We didn't need anybody's help because we had the safest border in U.S. history three years ago. We didn't need anybody's help. Today, we have a catastrophe waiting to happen. It's a terrible situation. Never had anything like it before. It's the worst border anywhere in the history of the world, and I believe that includes other countries. There's never been a country where millions and millions of people are able to flow in with no vetting, no checking, no nothing. We don't know who they are. We don't know where they come from. They're pouring into our country, and they're coming from prisons, they're coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. They're human traffickers. They're coming in. They're drug dealers. They're coming in. We have no idea, and we have no idea what we're doing with our country. Our country's going to hell because of incompetent or bad people. Terrorists are pouring in unchecked from all over the world. We have more terrorists now. I never really believed this fully, but I know we did a good job on it. In 2019, remember they said they had no terrorists. They do these checks—I don't know. None sounds like something Trump would say, to be honest. They say, only Trump would say—they actually have it down. It's a report, and it says none. And then the following two years later, they have record number of terrorists now pouring into our—same report, record number of terrorists coming into our country. There's a 100% chance that there will be a major terrorist attack in the United States or many attacks maybe, and it's all because of what's happened over the last three years. When I'm President, instead of trying to send Texas a restraining order, I will send them reinforcements. [cheers and applause]. CROWD: USA, USA, USA- TRUMP: Instead of fighting border states, I will use every resource, tool, and authority of the U.S. president to defend the United States of America from this horrible invasion that is taking place right now. There's never been anything like it. Texas will be given full support, and I will deploy all necessary military and law enforcement resources to seal up the final section of border. You know we built over 500 miles of wall, fortunately. But what they're doing is just not even—It's not even believable. Usually, you like to know the other side, and you like to know where the other side's coming from. Nobody, to this day, can explain why this open wound is good for our country and even politically. Why is it good politically? First of all, with the Hispanic vote, we're doing better now than the Democrat Party. So, I think it's good for us. But we're going to seal the border, complete it, and we're going to repeal the invasion. You know that—remember that in 2016 when I campaigned, everybody remembers that we had a very bad border, nothing like today. And I solved the problem. Then when I ran in 2020 and, by the way, got the most votes in the history of any sitting president running for president, we got the most votes. We got more votes than any other sitting president. Think of that. But we had a campaign, and we did great in that campaign. Frankly, we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016, but something happened. Not going to happen this time. Something happened. Bad, bad things happened. But anyway—but I didn't have the border to run on because I did such a good job with the border that the border wasn't an issue. And I went backstage to all of my people. I said, I want to talk about the border. Sir, nobody cares about the border. You solved the problem. I said, so I did such a good job, I took it out of play. And now I'm saying the border is in play like it's never been in play before because what they've done is they've taken all of the things that I did to make it so good. Literally, we couldn't put it in a speech. Nobody wanted to hear about the border. We had no border problem. We had the strongest border we've ever had in history. But now we can talk about the border because it's never ever been worse than it is now. I don't think any border in the entire world has ever been worse. Third world countries would fight with sticks and stones to keep people out in that kind—That's, that's incredible. I believe that the number by the end of the Biden administration will be close to 18 million people. That's bigger than New York state. I believe that's going to be the real number. Eighteen million people. And who does it hurt the worst? African Americans and Hispanics. It hurts the Hispanics and the African Americans first. When you look at the poll numbers, how well we're doing with Hispanics and African Americans, nobody's ever seen anything like it. They're a little concerned, the Democrats. The Democrats on the left. It was just announced that 302,000 illegal aliens trespassed across our border last month, 302,000. [booing]. By the way, that's an all-time record. There's never been a number like that. Last month—302,000, that's bigger than most cities in our country. Yet unbelievably, rather than helping Texas to build our border security up, crooked Joe Biden is fighting Texas to tear our beautiful border security down. They're cutting all the wire. Let's cut the wire. Let everybody in. No, no. They want open borders. They could've solved—in three weeks, I would have been able to get another 150 miles of wall up. Think of that. The wall was there. All they had to do is put it up. It was all set to be put up, and you know what they did? They sold it for five cents on the dollar. They sold it as scrap. They want to have open borders, and you're going to remember that come November. Now they're trying to blame anybody that they can. They're going to blame your great lieutenant governor who's here. I appreciate it. We're going to introduce him in a second. They're going to blame you. They're going to blame the governor. They're going to blame me. They're going to blame everybody. They're going to blame Leo. They're going to blame Leo 2.0. Look, Leo. They're going to blame you, Leo. But Leo can handle it. That's one thing. Leo can handle it. [cheers]. Thank you. But let there be no doubt, what Joe Biden is doing is a crime against our nation. It's an absolute betrayal of our country, and it's an atrocity against our Constitution. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. Crooked Joe will not get away with these crimes. He will be tried at the ballot box in November, and you will go back to having the strongest border, even stronger than I gave you. But we'll take that, too. We'll take anything when you look at what's happened to our country. And with your vote, he will be judged and convicted by the American people of this atrocity that he's done. Nobody can believe what's happened. Under the Trump administration, we ended catch and release. Remember catch and release? You know what release is? We release him into our country, criminals. What do you do? I murdered someone. Comes from a jail. We release them into our country. We got Mexico to send 28,000 troops. You remember this? 28,000 troops. You think that was easy, don't you? It wasn't easy. I had to tell the President of Mexico, we want you to send us 28,000 troops. He said, you have to be kidding. He's a very smart guy. He actually is a great guy. I like him. He's a socialist, but that's okay. You can't have everything. But no, he's a great guy. He said, I'm not going to send you—why would I send you 28,000? Which is what anybody here would say. I said, no, no, you will. One hundred percent sure you will. He said, I'm not sending troops. I said, you will. You will. Send me your rep. I don't want to get into an argument with you. I like you too much. Send me your top negotiator. And he sent this very handsome guy. He actually came into New York, and I met him in New York. Can you believe that? We met during the United Nations, and I said, ""We need 28,000 soldiers. We need Remain in Mexico. We need catch and release in Mexico."" This is now catch and release in Mexico. There's a little difference, right, not catch and release in the USA. But I went to the Border Patrol, Brandon Judd, fantastic. I went to Tom Holman separately. I went to a whole group of incredible patriots. I said, ""Give me the top 10 things."" And I was dealing with a woman from the State Department who was a very quality woman, but a lousy negotiator. She was there 24 years. She said, ""I worked in Mexico for 24 years, sir. You're not going to get any of these things."" I said, ""Give me a top 10 list, top 10. Give me 10 things you want. I'll get every one of them."" ""Sir, you won't."" They gave me a top 10 list. Brandon Judd, all the guys, they know exactly—they gave me that 10. I put it down, and I said, ""I'll get every one of these things."" And then he came in. The gentleman came in, tall, handsome, obviously from Mexico. I said, ""Where did you buy your suits? I love your suit. Where did you buy it?"" I said, ""I'm going to that shop right away. I think it's beautiful."" I said, ""How much did you pay for your suit?"" I said, ""Now let's get down to business. We want you to give us 28,000 soldiers, free of charge."" He said, ""No, we're not going to do that. Why the hell, sir? Why would we do that? I want to be respectful, sir. But we wouldn't even think about that."" ""Yes, you will, 100%."" He said, ""No, no, we won't."" I said, ""You will."" He said, ""No way."" I said, ""Way."" [laughter]. And then I said, ""I want you to have a policy now I'm going to institute. It's called Remain in Mexico. They had to agree to it."" They said, ""We're not going to let you. You're talking about hundreds of thousands of people."" I said, ""Maybe millions because the way they're coming up in the caravans."" A name I came up with, by the way, I'm very proud of that name. I came up with fake news. Look at all the fake news back there. I came up with a lot of good names. I came up with a lot of good names. I said, ""No, we want a Remain in Mexico policy."" Nobody ever even heard of that, Remain—It sounds nice, right? Not remain in the USA, remain in Mexico until they can be vetted, which might take about three years. I said, ""Remain in Mexico. I want catch and release in Mexico."" I wanted Title 42 to keep people that had big problems out. I wanted a policy where we bring children back to their parents, wherever they may be, and we had that very strongly. All things that they said, ""No, no, no, no."" He kept saying, ""No."" I said, ""Listen, you're saying no to everything, right?"" ""Yep."" ""Here's the story. These 10 things, I want them. I'm going to give you one last chance."" ""We can't do it, sir. We just can't."" I said, ""Here's the story. It's Friday at 4:00. On Monday morning at 7:00 in the morning, every single item, especially the cars that you stole out of the USA to manufacture them in Mexico, every single thing that comes into the United States is going to have a 25% tariff. In two weeks, if you don't approve it, in two weeks, the 25 goes to 50%, every single item. So we want 28,000 soldiers. We want Remain in Mexico. We want catch and release in Mexico. We want all of these things."" I gave him five other things, which were almost as bad. He said, ""Sir, may I have five minutes to make a phone call?"" I said, ""You're going to call the president?"" ""Yes, I am."" He calls the president. He comes back in about two minutes. ""Sir, it would be our great honor to supply the United States with 28,000 soldiers. Great honor. It would be our great honor, sir."" That was how I got all that stuff. And then Biden comes in. The first week, he let it all go. Just very sad. You've seen a lot of him at the beach. We all have consultants. The thing is, I don't listen to mine enough. I should listen. But we've been right about almost everything. Did you ever see the hat, ""Trump is right about everything?"" I hope I'm not right about World War III because you're very close to World War III. I'm not predicting it, but I'm saying you're very close. We have a man negotiating for us who can't put two sentences together. He can't see the stage. He can't find the stairs to get off the stage. I'm not going to imitate him because every time I imitate him, they say, ""He couldn't find his way."" It's true. It's true. True, Robert. It's true. Two weeks ago, I did one of the greatest imitations. I imitated him. He finishes the speech. His speeches last for about three minutes because his gasoline sort of runs out a little bit. It's a little bit like an electric car, isn't it? It doesn't go far. It doesn't go far. Got a couple of problems. Doesn't go far now. No, but he finished his speech, and I did this great imitation. He always points like, "" Huh?"" And then he walks in a different direction. But I did it. He goes like, ""Huh?"" And then- CROWD: We love Trump. We love Trump- TRUMP: Thank you. And then a handsome secret service agent, one of these handsome guys, the secret service is great, they run up on stage and they pretend like everything's normal. Like, ""Oh, it's right over here, sir. Right over here."" I got to thank him. No, he's negotiating with Putin and with Kim Jong-Un. Think of it. He's negotiating with President Xi of China. Think of it—Kim Jong-Un North Korea, he's negotiating. I did a good job with Kim Jong-Un. We had a very good relationship. People don't like it when I say that, but we were very safe when I was your president. You're not safe now, but you're very close to a third world war. And you know the bombs are starting to drop all over the Middle East again. You see that, right? And all those things could be fixed to our benefit with strength, to our benefit with strength. And Israel would've never happened, and Ukraine would've never happened. There wouldn't have been an attack on Israel. There wouldn't have been an attack on Ukraine, and we wouldn't have had any inflation. Inflation was caused by energy, by fuel, by oil going to $100 and $110 a barrel. But our border was perfect. But remember this—so I did the imitation, and the next day, all over television, ""See Trump get off. He can't get off the stage either."" They're the same. Then they said, ""We don't like these 81, 82-year-old…"" I said, I'm 77. Five years is a big difference. But no, they always say I'm 81. They say like we're the—we're not the same age. But you know what? I know, guys. I know one man who became a billionaire. He was sort of not a loser. He was a very smart guy. But his whole life, he never was able to make money. On his 80th birthday, he made a deal and he became a billionaire from 80 to 90. And to this day, he's very sharp. He was sharper, and he told me he felt stronger and smarter. I'll tell you what, I feel sharper now than I did 20 years ago. I really do. I don't know. It's probably not true. It's probably not true. And I think anybody running for president should take an aptitude or a cognitive test. I do. I think you want to have people that can pass things. And I took one in office. Remember they were saying—first, they said, "" This guy is brilliant. He wants to take over the world. He wants to take"" That didn't work. Then they went to about four different scenarios. Then they said, ""He wants total control of the United States. He's never going to give up control. He's totally brilliant."" Then they went to a different one. That didn't work too much. That didn't scare people. Then they said, ""He's dumb as a rock. He's dumb as a rock."" I said, ""Ooh, that one I don't like."" So I said to Doc Ronnie—Do you know Doc Ronnie? From Texas, the White House doctor. Doc Ronnie. He's the great doc. He's a doc. He's a doctor— White House doctor for Obama, for Trump. He was Obama—and they asked him, ""Who is in better health? Who's more physically fit?"" You know what he said? Trump. And I said I'll endorse that guy anytime. He said, ""Trump would live to 200 years old if he wouldn't eat so much junk food."" Sort of interesting. Dr. Ronnie Jackson, so he was an admiral, a doctor, White House doctor. Now, he's a great congressman from Texas. And I said to him, ""Ronnie, I'd like to take a cognitive test."" I never heard of it before, but whatever it is. I like tests. I've always liked tests. Tests are very interesting. And I had an uncle. He's the longest serving professor, Dr. John Trump, in the history of MIT. Same genes. We have genes. We're smart people. We're smart people we're like race—Mr. Lieutenant Governor, we're like race horses too. The fast ones produce the fast ones, and the slow ones, doesn't work out so well, right? But we're no different in that sense. But I said, ""So what do you think, Ronnie?"" He said, ""Well, you're going to take it. The thing is, it's a very public test because we're doing it at a great hospital, Walter Reed, a great hospital. They have incredible doctors."" I said, ""Is it tough?"" He said, ""Yeah, it's a tough test."" The first couple of questions are easy. They'll have a lion, a giraffe, a whale, and a shark, and they'll say, ""Which one's the lion?"" Okay. And that's all the press covered. The first question. They didn't cover the last question. Multiply 4,733, multiply times seven, divide, without paper and pencil, by the way, divide it by four, add up another 37 and a half, 0.5. I remember that. Now, what's your number? How many people in this room could do it? Not too many. Or they give you six names in a row. I took a lot of heat on this. They give you six names in a row at the beginning. ""Sir, I'm going to give you six names."" Good. They look at them, a chair, a hat, a badge, a necklace, and they vote those things. We're going to give you six things. And I say, ""Good. What's going on?"" ""Can you rename them?"" So I name them. Then they go back, ""And if you can do it in order, that's even better."" I do them in order. Perfect. Then they come back to you 30 minutes later at the end, last question, they say, ""What were those six things?"" There aren't too many people—and they laughed. Everyone said, ""Oh, that's so easy."" There's only about 2% of this room can do it, but I did it. I did it very easily, but I got mocked. They said, ""Oh, that's so easy."" It's not easy. It's not easy. Go home and try doing it. Okay? Go home—so I took a cognitive, and Ronnie announced that publicly, there were doctors sitting there, a team of doctors, he said, ""The bad thing is if you do poorly, sir, it's going to get out."" I said, ""Will it get out if I do well?"" ""Yeah, but not nearly as much,"" because that's not what the fake news wants, right? So I aced it. And then recently, I took another one because I had my physical exam, which worked out very nicely. I feel I have an obligation to take a physical exam. Excellent exam. I took a cognitive test. Excellent. And I would challenge most of the people running to cognitive tests because most of them couldn't come anywhere close. And you have to be able to do that because these people are people of misinformation and disinformation, and you have to be ableut I really believe it's important. I don't know. They say it's not constitutional. I don't know why. They say it's not constitutional to take an aptitude or cognitive test. But I think anybody running for president, that includes vice president, and maybe even some other positions, I think taking certain tests, cognitive tests, aptitude tests, I think that would be a good thing, personally. Not based on age. I don't care if you're 35 years old, but we want intelligent people. Now, that's not a pure sign of intelligence, but we want people that are intelligent. So I'm going to go out and I'm going to say that's my thing. I don't know if the fake news is going to report it, but I think everybody running for president and vice president should take a cognitive test. Okay? Everybody. And you would be amazed at how many people would fail it. So now, Biden is trying to gas—oh, how do you think he's doing a test? Okay? He might not get that first question right, actually. So now Biden is trying to gaslight the American public by claiming that his border disaster is Republican's fault. It's the Republican's fault. Look at these great people, all big shot politicians. It's your fault. Even though we had the safest border, the best border in history three years ago, he's actually trying to blame us for the border. And I think it's just disgraceful. And that's what they do. They're a party of disinformation. They will take something. And they feel if you say it over and over and over again, people will start to believe it. This is purely set up by Democrats, and I think they're trying to get out. [turns to crowd and sees someone in need of medical attention] Medical? Okay. Yeah, medical, please. Are they okay? Yeah. Please go ahead. Doctor in the house. Thank you. Thank you. I love those people. You know they're waiting outside for 10 hours, 12 hours. I love you, darling. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. No, we don't want to see anybody, even the other side, we don't want to see them hurt, even the other side. Thank you, doctor. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Take your time, doctor. These are our great friends. These are our loyal, incredible friends. We take care of everybody, but we take care of our friends. You see, if this were the State of the Union Address, I wouldn't do that because it's got to be this way. You can't say, ""Oh, if someone—"" But we're all very good friends. We love each other. It's very hot outside. We have to do it, right? Right, Robert? Joe Biden made a State of the Union last year. It was the worst speech I think I've ever seen. And I listened to MSDNC and CNN. And they said, ""this had shades of FDR."" I said ""you've got to be—"" You know FDR was a very good speaker, very elegant speaker. They said it was shades of FDR. I don't think so. [Addresses the doctor]. You looking good doctor? That's good. CROWD: Thank you Trump, Thank you Trump, Thank you Trump— TRUMP: Yeah, that's good. Thank you, doctor. Great job. Thank you. I'm getting a thumbs up. They have a great group here. We have a great group of people. All right, let's get going, right? Come on. Let's go. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. And that great supporter, I want to thank you. They've been here so long and standing in the sun. The so-called border security deal Biden is gushing out and pushing out is not designed to stop illegal immigration. It's designed to continue the invasion of America while sending billions of dollars to Ukraine and other countries. And you know Ukraine's an interesting case. People always want to know my feeling. Number one, we're in for 200 billion plus, and the European nations are in for 20 billion, and it's more important for them. And don't you think they should equalize? Nobody asks them. It's like I did with NATO. I said, we're spending, we're paying for NATO, and we don't get so much out of it. And I hate to tell you this about NATO. If we ever needed the help, let's say we were attacked, I don't believe they'd be there. I don't believe—I know the people. I know them. I can tell you country by country, who would be there and who—but I don't believe they'd be there. But I took care of NATO. I said, ""You got to pay your bills. If you don't pay your bills, we're not going to be there to support you."" And the following day, the money came rolling into NATO. But the European nations, if you add them up, the economy is about the same size as the U.S., believe it or not. A lot of people are surprised. You add them all up, and they are in for about $20 billion, and we're in for $200 billion because we're stupid. All we have to do is say pay. Nobody ever says to them pay. You don't even hear that. I say pay, and they'll pay too. You have to equalize. It's just one example of the border bill, the monstrosity that we're dealing with. Two million illegals crossed the border every single year in the past, and now that number is changing to maybe eight times that amount. We cannot let this happen to our country. As the leader of our party, there is zero chance I will support this horrible open borders betrayal of America. It's not going to happen. I noticed that—and I'll fight it all the way. I noticed a lot of the Senators, a lot of the Senators are trying to say respectfully— they're blaming it on me. I said, ""That's okay. Please blame it on me, please,"" because they were getting ready to pass a very bad bill. And I'll tell you what a bad bill is—I'd rather have no bill than a bad bill. A bad bill, you can't have. And that's what was happening. And the house, as you know, the speaker who's—by the way, I think he's going to prove to be a very good speaker. It's tough when you have a very small majority, very tough. Mike Johnson, speaker, he just said, ""It's dead on arrival in the house. It's dead on arrival."" We want either a strong bill or no bill, and whatever ","happens, happens. But this is the single greatest threat to our country right now, is the people pouring into our country because we have no idea who they are. The fact is that if Joe Biden truly wanted to secure the border, he doesn't really need a bill. I didn't need a bill. I did it without a bill. I did it with the current laws. I used border patrol. I didn't have a bill. I didn't need lots of different things. It's not that complicated. You say, ""I don't want the people coming in."" They say, ""Yes, sir, there won't be any people coming in."" And that's what we did. It's not that complicated. But all Biden needs to do is to reimpose every single border policy of the former president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Did you ever hear of him? And remember I alluded to it, the bathing suit. He's in the bathing suit. If he would just go to the beach and—if he would've just gone to the beach— You know what? They think he looks good in a bathing suit. You know the chair, those chairs are meant for little children to lift up for their grandfathers. Okay? He can't lift up the chair. He can't drag his feet through the sand. It doesn't work too well. Remember what he said? I'd like to take him behind the barn and punch him. Remember? And they all thought—the fake news said, ""Isn't that nice? Isn't that cute? Oh, that was such a cute?"" Supposedly, I said that about him, ""I'd like to take him behind the barn and give him a shot."" They'd say, ""He's a fascist. He's the fascist."" They would call me a fascist. With him, he can say it. They thought it was so cute. I remember when he said that. And you know what would happen if he took me behind the barn, I'd go like this. It would happen very fast. It would be over very fast. But they called me a fascist when I suggested it. Every day, Biden's extremist open borders agendas destroying innocent lives. Last month in Texas, a savage, illegal alien monster was charged with brutally murdering a 16-year-old Texas high school cheerleader, murdered her, stabbing her 19 times, and leaving her body in a bathtub. He was led into our country illegally, just—oh, and the crime is rampant, by the way. In New York, in the Roosevelt Hotel, they say they are just— they're fighting everybody, including themselves. They're beating the hell out of each other. This is a rough group of people we're living in. Many of them are very rough people. These are not babies. Again, they come from prisons and jails, right? They come from mental institutions. These are rough people. These aren't babies. The only thing is they make our prisoners look like very nice people. Just weeks ago, a five-time deported illegal alien who claims he was possessed by a demon was sentenced for beating and raping a young woman with special needs in what one law enforcement official described as among the most heinous crimes that she'd ever seen, 15 years that she'd ever seen in law enforcement. And just recently, a vicious illegal alien criminal who was wanted for murder, all over the planet wanted, everybody knew this person, not a good person, was discovered living as a fugitive right here in Las Vegas. Isn't that nice? We have no choice. Within moments of my inauguration, we will begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. [cheering]. That's right. We have no choice because this is not sustainable. It's no wonder Joe Biden and his thugs are so desperate to stop us. They know that we are the only ones who can stop them. They know that. That's why they're weaponizing law enforcement for high level election interference. You know that. And I'm the victim of it, but that's okay. I'm the victim of it, and it's my great honor because you're finding out they're doing things to me that has never happened. And here I am, and we're leading in every poll. So just, let's get there. Let's get there. The closer we do, and the better we do, the more dramatic they become. Joe Biden is a threat to democracy. He is for a lot of reasons. Number one, he's incompetent. That's a threat to democracy. Incompetence is a gross threat to democracy. But he's a real—he's a real threat. What they're doing with elections and election interference, as an example, what they do with me, look at yesterday, look at all this crap that's going on, but we keep marching forward. We just keep going. And somehow it all works out. Somehow. People say, ""How do you do it, sir? How do you do it?"" I get two questions. If you had it to do again, would you do it? Because in history, they say the president that was treated the worst was Abraham Lincoln, but he had the Civil War, so he had a little civil war going. Abraham Lincoln. And Jackson was treated very badly, and a couple of others were treated—Andrew Jackson, he was treated very badly, and a few others. And I haven't seen the new list, but if I'm not number one over Abraham Lincoln, I will be very disappointed because I don't believe any president's ever been—and they do that because their policies can't work. This is the only way they think they can win. Because we have strong voters, we have strong elections. We have to—if you don't have borders and elections, you don't have a country, and we have strong borders, and we are going to have very strong elections. So virtually every poll has us crushing crooked Joe in the general election debate. Well, you saw the ones that came out today, one at six, one at seven, one at eight, and one at eleven in the swing states while Nikki Haley—have you ever heard of her? I didn't know she was still campaigning. She's still campaigning? She was just endorsed by Liz Cheney. Can you believe it? If Liz Cheney ever endorsed me, I'd say, ""No, I don't want it. I don't want that in."" And there's a comparison graphic that they're going to put up on the screen, which is sort of interesting, but we're beating everybody. We're beating her by a lot, but we're beating Biden. She can't beat Biden, the polls are showing, the most recent polls, because she doesn't have Republican support. You know what she doesn't have? She doesn't have MAGA. She doesn't have MAGA. There's no MAGA. The radical left Democrats want Nikki Haley because they know she's the easiest person to beat and she will. She doesn't have Republican support. Nikki Haley supports a 23% national sales tax and she wants to gut Medicare and Social Security, raising the retirement age of Social Security too. Think of this, about 77, about 10 years, 12 years. Anybody in their 60s or 70s? Would you like to say, ""I'm just about there darling?"" You're 62 years old. ""I'm just about there darling, but I see Nikki Haley wants to make it 10 years longer."" Despite being completely unelectable, and I believe she's unelectable, Nikki is a continuing—she's got a continuing plan in a shameless, radical left craziness because she's basically a Democrat. She's almost a radical left Democrat, which is hard to win elections like that, but it's like they used certain things as like a Trojan horse in the Republican primaries. Haley made a corrupt deal to sell out to the radical left, taking the Democrat money from donors and recruited all the votes. In the primaries that you just saw, she got killed in both of them. You had Iowa, you had New Hampshire. She got absolutely beaten badly, and she tried to cancel out Republicans and she sort of did. She only got 25% of the Republican vote in Iowa where she came in a distant third, a distant third. Remember, we have Ron DeSantis. Now, you know I've terminated that other name, right? They asked me, they said, they said, ""What about the DeSanctimonious?"" I said, ""No, I put that into retirement, that name."" So now I called Ron DeSantis, but Ron DeSantis came in second. She came in third, a distant third, and he got out and then she went to New Hampshire and she got slaughtered in New Hampshire, even though she had a lot of Democrats voting for her, because in New Hampshire they allowed Democrats and Independents to vote. I said, ""This could be a little tough,"" and we still won by a lot, by a landslide, I guess. Sort of a landslide. And she didn't come to Nevada because they looked at a poll and I was at 97%. She said, ""I think we're not going to win Nevada."" And we have a caucus, and it's not really a traditional thing, it's a caucus. Caucuses can be very good. Caucuses—like Iowa was a caucus, it's very interesting. It's actually a lot more work, but it's a very interesting way to go. Trump Republican voters are going to defeat Nikki Haley's Liberal Democrat donors every single time. I mean biggest donor is a radical left donor who will drop her right after this, but the donor is a big radical lefty, a slob. He's a slob. You take a look at him, he's a radical left donor who gave her a lot of money because they want to fight her. They want to be against her because they didn't do too well in 2016, and they got lucky as hell with all the theft in 2020. They got lucky as hell. They don't want to go through that again. So now they've weaponized, they hope that's going to be their new form of cheating, weaponizing. They want to weaponize the FBI, the DOJ. That's going to be their form of cheating. The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024. And every time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, communists and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor because I'm being indicted for you. I am being indicted for you. Think of it, Al Capone. I got indicted four times. This was not on my books, you know? I went to the Wharton School of Finance. They didn't teach Indictment 101. I got indicted four times. Al Capone, the meanest of all, Scarface, they used to call him Scarface. Alphonse Capone. Al Capone, the great gangster. He was indicted less than me. I wonder what my parents looking down saying, ""Son, we're so proud of you."" Never forget our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. Never, ever. [crowd cheers] They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. That's what they want to do. That's the game they play. And in the end, they're not after me. They're after you. I just happened to be standing in the way. Here I am. It's been a lot of fun. It's been a lot of fun. Had a good time. You get indicted because, one of the indictments, ""He fought the election."" Yeah, the election was rigged. Of course, you fight it. By the way, you still have them fighting the 2016 election. I think every Democrat Congressman and Senator fought the 2016. It's okay for them, but if we fight it—but we actually caught it and it was rigged and it was stolen. Did you see where Biden two days ago said, ""I want to see the real Governor, the real Governor of Virginia?"" In other words, he said the election was rigged and stolen. Is he going to be indicted for that? What do you think, Robert? I don't think so, right? I don't think so. I don't think so. We're delighted to be joined today by a lot of people that are great leaders of your state. A man who's done a fantastic job as Lieutenant Governor, Stavros Anthony. Stravros, thank you very much. Thank you. Republican National Committeewoman, Sigal Chattah. Sigal, sit up. Thank you darling. Sigal. Clark County Chairman, Jesse Law. Thank Jesse. Thank you, Jesse. Will you make sure they don't cheat in Clark County? I'm putting you in charge, because we had a lot of problems with Clark County last time. Thank you, Jesse. I appreciate it. Esmeralda County Chairwoman, Teresa Barnes. Teresa, thank you. Thank you, Teresa Barnes. State Senator, Jeff Stone. Good guy too. A good guy. Thank you, Jeff. Good job. Nevada Assembly Members, Richard MacArthur, Greg Hafen, Toby Yurek. Thank you fellas. Got a lot of power in this room. We got a lot of power in this 100 degree room, don't we? You know the fake news, sometimes it's 100, 110 degrees. Sometimes it's some of these—these buildings weren't built for this, right? Crowds like this? And if I'm a little bit wet, they say, ""Oh, he was sweating. He was sweating."" I don't think that too many people up here that wouldn't be sweating. Not too many people could speak the first paragraph, but you know what? It's great. And the people are getting very close to getting in now. I hope they haven't missed too much. U.S. Senate candidates, really good people. Ambassador Jeffrey Gunter. Jeffrey. Jeffrey. These are three great candidates. Sam Brown and Amy, his fantastic wife. Sam Brown. Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Amy. Thank you very much. Great. It's going to be a very good race and we'll see what happens, but it's going to be great. And Jim Marchant. Jim. Jim. Thank you, Jim very much. Jesus Marquez is the American Christian caucus leader. Jesus, thank you very much. And Wayne Allyn Root, he's something. Wayne Allyn Root, I think he's back there with the fake news. And a guy who I just happen to love. He used to be a Democrat. I used to watch him on Sean Hannity as a Democrat, and somehow he flipped. I don't know if he's a Republican actually, I'm not sure. I don't think he is, but he is a Trump guy, that I know. Leo 2.0. Leo Terrell. He's great. He's a great guy. Boy, I'd like to have him as my lawyer. I could use you. Do you want to get out of this television business, Leo? Former Acting Attorney General of the United States, Matt Whitaker. Matt, thank you very much. And a warrior, Kash Patel, a warrior. He loves it. He loves war. And one of our big television stars, and you know who he is. He's been to a lot of rallies. He had a tragedy this week. His son passed away. Fentanyl. Fentanyl. And he is a fantastic person and a great television personality, but your boy is up there looking down on you, Rick Harrison. He's looking down on you and he loves you and he's proud of you and it's not an easy deal, the fentanyl. So very special guy, one of the best developers you'll ever see. He's big. He's rich, but he's a high quality man. Built some of the most beautiful things you'll ever look at. Robert Bigelow. Robert, please. Good-looking stuff. Thank you. And another tremendous businessman, he just sold his company for like 3 billion. He's very solid. He's very liquid, but he has done a fantastic job and he loves this area. This is where he grew up. He was born here. He's built here. He's done a fantastic job. Don Ahern. Don Ahern. Don, thank you. [points to Don] Thank you, man. Thank you. We love you too. You've done a hell of a job. So our top phone call volunteer, these are the people—Don, I have to introduce. This person made 114,000 phone calls, Rose Worrell. She's made like hundreds of thousands. Where is Rose? Right there, Rose. [points to Rose] We love you. You are more important than these rich people, Rose. Thank you very much. And our top caucus captain, Marie Arena, who's done over 100,000. Think of this, hundreds of thousands of calls, but she's got hundreds of friends coming to the caucus and they'll be leading the caucus, and I want to thank you very much. She's been with me since 2015, if you can believe that, right? 2015. So I want to thank you both very much. It's beautiful. That's beautiful. And sign up to volunteer and you get one of those beautiful caucus caps like we gave out. I noticed we gave them out in Iowa. Everybody wanted those caps. I wanted one. I wore one all day long. I loved it. I like it better than any other cap I think I've ever had. From the very first day that we take back the White House from crooked Joe Biden, I believe we're going to have the greatest four years in our country's history. I believe that. I believe that, or I wouldn't be doing this. I wouldn't be doing it. You know if I wasn't running or if I was in fourth place, fifth place, seventh place, we started off with 12, sort of reminds me of 2016. We started off with 18, including me, and then week by week, boom, boom. It was like chopping down a tree. Boom, what a great feeling. Boom, boom, boom. We started off with 11. The first few fell off fast, and then they got a little bit tougher, boom, boom, boom. And now we're down to one and she's not doing too well. She's in South Carolina and I'm leading by 78 points. That's a lot. But I wouldn't do this, and you know if I didn't think we could do a great job because we had among the greatest four year periods in the history of the presidency. Think of the things. We cut your taxes more than the Reagan tax cuts. Number one biggest tax cut, number one biggest regulation cut in history, which is even frankly for the business people, more important, it employed so many. We had the greatest economy in history. We had we rebuilt our military. We defeated ISIS. Everybody said, ""You can't defeat ISIS."" We came out with Right to Try. That's space-age medicines that can't be used for years because they're under. You know I used to say, ""Why don't we use these great medicines?"" ""Sir, we can't use them. People may get hurt."" "" Well no, these are people that are terminally ill."" They didn't want to do it because the insurance companies had a problem. The labs had a problem, doctors had a problem, and the country had a problem. One of the people said, ""We don't want to get sued if they die,"" but they're going to die anyway. So I said, ""Why?"" They've been trying to get this for 71 years approved. I got go Right To Try. And we have saved thousands and thousands of people with this with the right to use certain space-age medical. The medicines that they're using wouldn't be out for five or six years, and it's really turned out to be the opposite. Thousands of people are now living. Some of them are living… They were terminal and now they're living perfectly. They don't even have to go back. I mean it's gone. What they've done, and in the old days, which was six years ago, people would go, they'd go to Asia, they'd go to Europe, they'd go all over the world looking for a cure, and they'd usually come back home and die. Or if they didn't have money, they'd go home and die. Now you sign a piece of paper, there's no liability to anybody. They give you these new drugs, pills, shots, whatever it might be, and many, many thousands of people are living now that would not be living. So we did so many things. Rebuilding our military was so great. Unfortunately, we gave $85 billion of it to Afghanistan because we had a bunch of not smart people running that operation. Under my leadership, virtually everyone was better off, including very importantly, our cherished Hispanic American community. [crowd cheers]. By the way, did you see the poll today? I'm leading in the Hispanic community. I'm leading. That's right. It's the first time in their history of the poll, this particular one, where a Republican is leading with Hispanics. CROWD: We love Trump, We Love Trump, We Love Trump TRUMP: Wow. Look at over there. [looks to the outside]. Look at over there and look at all the people that couldn't get into this place. Wow, they didn't get in. They're screaming from outside with the same amount of enthusiasm. Thank you. That's amazing. You know what? That's like a poll. You know that, right? That's better than a poll. When you see crowds like this, and let's say somebody else came here, anybody, if you had 100 people, it would be a lot. We have thousands and thousands of people and thousands of people that can't get in, which is really very nice and uh I appreciate it. We're going to make our country great again. We're going to make it great again. When I was your president, Hispanic Americans had the lowest unemployment rate in the history of these polls. You know these polls have gone back a long way, but they never had numbers like you're having today. Today, the polls are beyond anyone. Uh six, seven years ago, you had actual numbers, not polls. You had actual numbers where they were the best till that time. We're blowing them away and we're blowing them away with African-American people who are the single most affected people by what's happening at our border, African American, number one, Hispanic American, number two. They are being horribly threatened because of what's happening, because millions of people are pouring in and the real number is 18,000,000. You remember that, I said it earlier because the fake news wants you to think, it's bigger than New York State, bigger than New York State, and that's affecting… that's I think I have the highest African-American numbers that anyone's seen, and I have the highest Hispanic numbers that anyone's seen. And if those polls are right, that means the Democrats are in big trouble. ""We better indict Trump a couple of more times."" Go ahead. They're going to indict me right into office. Crooked Joe Biden has devastated the Latino community. Biden's inflation disaster has crushed your household finances. I mean what he's done to your finances are incredible. He's crushed your finances and his open borders policy. They've demolished your wages. His inflation that he caused and would've been so easy not to. All it was, is energy. Remember this, gasoline, fuel, oil, natural gas went up to a level that it was impossible not. That's what caused inflation, and we're going to bring it down because we're going to go drill, baby drill. We drill, baby drill. We're bringing it way down. [crowd cheers] And all communities, but again, Hispanic and African-American, they've flooded. They've absolutely flooded. He's allowed this to come into our country, coming in from China, from all parts of the world, through the southern border. Four years ago, they didn't have that. They had to go through hell. I remember I was negotiating the prices of machinery that would capture the scent of drugs, and we had great stuff. By the way, you know what the best machine is? A German shepherd, a certain German shepherd. There is no machine that is comparable to our dog. Is that a—I just thought I'd throw that out, but it's true. How do we get some more of those dogs? I like that better than spending a million bucks for a machine that doesn't work as well, but it's true. The crime and all of the problems that have come in, and you got to remember, they could have stopped it, but the black community and the Hispanic community are—is affected more than anybody else by far. And so remember that when you go to the polls, and especially when you go in November, but on top of it all, crooked Joe and… I call them thugs, they're persecuting Catholics. Anybody in here Catholic? Anybody? They are persecuting Catholics. I don't know how. I've never seen anything like it. The FBI, the DOJ is persecuting Catholics, and yet the Catholic vote… With the Evangelicals, I got 88%. With the Catholics, we got 50/50. It was a 50/50. I think that's going to change. Catholics for whatever reason, are being persecuted by… You talk about weaponization, persecuted by Joe Biden's DOJ and FBI. So Catholics, will you remember that please, in November? I'm sure it'll only get worse. Every disaster Joe Biden has created for Hispanic Americans, I will solve, I'll get it solved and I'll get it solved and start the process on day one. On day one, we will start that process. That's why we're going to win the record share of Latino votes, the first time ever. We're going to get the record share and we'll get the highest number of African-American votes ever recorded, and I think pretty much everyone is agreeing on that. You know Senator Tim Scott was on television yesterday and he said, ""Trump has done more for African-Americans than any other president."" Opportunity zones, I did that with him. Funding for the black colleges and universities. They had no funds. I'll never forget it, the heads of the black colleges, universities, they would come in and they'd see me every year. After two years, I said, ""What are you doing?"" They said, ""For many years we come and see the president and we have to beg."" He used that term, a great guy. A lot of really good people, really good people, work hard. They came in and they need funds to keep their schools going. And then you have Harvard and you have all these other places with billions and billions of dollars and they still get funds, which is pretty stupid, right? But they'd come in and they'd see me and they'd say, ""We need help."" After the third year I said, ""What are you doing this for?"" And I got them long-term financing, more money than they asked for. Tim Scott was relating that story today and many other things, by the way. But you ought to look at opportunity zones. There's never been an economic development program, I think… That for Black Americans and Hispanic Americans, there's never been an economic program like that. Opportunity zones, and nobody likes to talk about it, but it's one of the most successful economic development programs. Just to finish that off, I also happened to do a thing called criminal justice reform that Joe Biden didn't want. And a lot of people didn't want it, and a lot of liberal people and some conservatives. It's interesting, they had a lot of conservative support and a lot of liberal support. Not a lot of support in the middle, but we got that done. So between those three or four things, nobody's ever done what I've done for the Black community. I appreciate Tim saying it this morning on one of the fake shows. Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. I'll get it done fast. I know them both. We will restore on this planet peace through earth. I am the only candidate who can make this promise to you. I will prevent World War III and we're very close to World War III. We're very close to World War III. On day one, I will end crooked Joe Biden's insane electric vehicle mandate. They weren't working too well in Iowa. It was 40 degrees below zero and you couldn't—you get into an electric car and you hear a buzzing. I said, ""What's that, sir?"" It works in zero, but you start getting below zero and you had those cars all over the place. It'd be a good time to take one. You could have taken one. You could have had all you wanted, but it wasn't, they were not working too well in Iowa. Think of that. We voted on a day where it was 40 below zero and we had a tremendous vote. It was like those people are hardy people. Somebody said, ""They're very hardy."" The people of Iowa are very hardy indeed. They voted in record numbers and I will end his American energy war. It's a war on American energy. It's a war. Just yesterday, Biden blocked the export of American natural gas to other countries. You know he doesn't want plants built in the United States, even though that's the best thing you could do. This stuff has been worked on for years. We approved, I approved many of them. We got many built in Louisiana and other places, but he stopped it. Now, why he stopped it? I guess it was the environmentalists I guess. But uh it's good for the environment, not bad and good for our country. I will approve the export terminals on my very first day back. I'm going to be signing so many different mandates on my first day back. All of that stuff, all of that stuff will be approved. I will direct a completely overhaul DOJ to investigate every radical out of control prosecutor in America for their illegal racist and reverse enforcement of the law. And I'm also going to indemnify all police officers and law enforcement officials throughout the United States to protect them from being destroyed by the radical left for taking strong action on crime. We don't want crime. These cities are crazy, what's going on? Hundreds of people yesterday walked into a department store and just walked out with everything. They emptied the store. Now the store's going to close. Five years ago, they were all pushing for this store to open. They open, now people are just walking in and robbing it. You can solve that in one hour. All you do is one hour. You have to treat the first one out the door the next time it happens extremely tough. That means anything you want to do and as soon as that word gets out and you let people know from now on, you don't walk out with aspirin. You know I have a building on 40 Wall Street, and we lost the big drug company where they sell drugs, drugstore. And uh I called the people, I said, ""What happened?"" He said, ""The people steal everything off the shelves. We have to build glass."" They built glass containers on the shelves. This is not just New York, all over the place. It's like a new form of crime. They walk in, they just take a bag. In some of these places, they don't prosecute you unless it's more than 2,000. In other words, you could take $2,000, anything more than that. But even that, they won't do anything. Guys walk in with bags. They go like this, they push everything into the bag and they walk out the store. They actually had an employee that got into a fight with one of these guys, and the company fired the employee for doing that. [crowd boos] What is wrong with our country? What's wrong with our patriotism? We're going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety, and beauty better than they've ever been before. And we will help them on crime because we're not going to let them be crime ridden monsters. And we will take over our horribly run capital of our nation in Washington DC and clean it up, renovate it, rebuild our capital so that it's no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world, which it was once before. You know we didn't have the problem with… It's happened over the last couple of years, but two nights ago, three people were shot. They walked out. They come in from Nebraska, they come in from all over the country. Three people are shot. They're just shot. They don't even know why. They're just shot and people don't wa","nt to go there anymore. It's our capital. We will treat those people when we catch them. We'll catch them rougher than any people have ever been treated and it'll all stop. It'll all stop. It's got to stop. Nobody wants to go there. And we will take all of the graffiti off the marble and we will clean up the roads and rebuild the roads and we will put medians in that aren't falling down all over, all over the asphalt. I went there about a month ago for one of the Biden trials. You know I got so many trials. I say, ""Which one is it, sir?"" ""That's number 14."" That's what they're doing. I got so many trials. So I'm going in, I'm going to a federal courthouse, which is in bad shape, very bad shape. But going there, I'm writing over paper, paper that's been laying on the roadway. These are the major roads into Washington DC. Paper that's been laying there for six months, cans, garbage. I said, ""Can you imagine?"" The median. You know the median, the metal crap that they have that's always falling, falling down before you even build this stuff? Somebody's a good lobbyist, but it's always falling down. I could ask Robert, ""What the hell is wrong with that stuff?"" You know exactly what I'm talking about. The day they put it up, it must be the sun, the heat, something, but it also gets hit and it's laying out on the roads. I'm saying, ""Can you imagine? You're the prime minister, you're the king, the queen of a country. You're the president of a country and you're driving in and you're driving over garbage to get to the White House or get to the Capitol. And you see roads that are in worse shape than most countries have. Roads that have potholes all over them. You see graffiti all over the white marble columns."" This is what's happening in our great Washington DC. We're going to take over Washington DC, we're going to federalize it. We're going to have the toughest law enforcement in the country. We're not going to have any more crime, and it's going to look beautiful. On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content onto our children. And I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate. And something I can't believe I have to say, but I guess I do. Because who would've thought even 10 years ago this was necessary? Because there are politicians that think this is a wonderful policy because they, they're not smart people or there's something going on. I will keep men out of women's sports. Can you imagine? Can you imagine weightlifting? You ever see the difference? Weightlifter, they broke the record by, I think, 142 pounds. The record stood for 18 years. They couldn't break it. A quarter of an ounce here, a quarter of it. They couldn't get it. This guy comes along. ""Have you ever lifted before?"" "" No, I haven't."" He broke the record by 142 pounds. I don't think… That record will stand a long time. You know if we ever get it straighter, we will because I'm going to sign it right away. But when that's straight, women are going to look back and they're going to say, ""Who the hell was it? That's 142 pounds more."" So we're going to have to bring back those records, I think. What do you think? Yes. Because those records aren't going to be broken within the next a hundred years by the women. How about the swimmers where you look at the swimmers, all these great swimmers and all of a sudden this woman against a guy. He looks like he's got the wingspan of the great Wilt Chamberlain, right? And uh he jumps into that pool and the young women left and right, they're badly injured by the wind as he goes by. They get windburned. I will fully uphold the second amendment and I did a great job in doing that. I don't ever allow the creation of a central bank digital currency, which is a big thing because they'll take all your money. ""They'll take all of your money, Don,"" and you won't know what the hell happened to my money. Of course the court systems here like to do that too. They do it there. That's like communism you know. When you think it's like a communist move, but digital currency, what do you see? But we'll get rid of that. We will protect innocent life and we will restore free speech and I will secure the elections like never have been secured before. [crowd cheers] Because if we don't have fair and honest elections and if we don't have border security, if we don't have strong borders and strong elections, we don't have a country. We don't have a country. And remember when I used to talk about the wall, I built this tremendous amount of walls. That's why we had the best record. But they used to say, ""Walls, we don't need walls. We need things flying up in the air."" No, you need walls because there's only two things in history that work long-term, everything else is obsolete. You do a new computer, it's obsolete in like three days. Walls and wheels. You always have walls and wheels. A wall has worked for a long time. Our goal will be one day voting with paper ballots and voter ID. But until then, Republicans, you have to win, Republicans. Go out and win. When we get in there, we're changing it around. We're going to get rid of all the stuff. Paper ballots, they make special paper today. It's incredible. It sounds crazy, but it's incredible, watermark and it's uh good. And some governors are doing it. Some of the Republican governors have actually already started it. And number one, you're going to save a hell of a lot of money. It's about 9% the cost of doing it the other way. If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States and added them up, they would not have done near the destruction to our country as crooked Joe Biden and the Biden administration have done. He's destroying, he's destorying our country. So if you want to save America, then get everyone you know out to vote in the Nevada caucuses on Thursday, February 8th. And it's very important for you to help educate all of our supporters that we're not talking about the government run, universal mail-in ballots. We don't want mail-in ballot. CROWD We want Trump. We want Trump. We want Trump. We want Trump. Trump: Thank you. CROWD MEMBER: We want Trump. Trump: Thank you. CROWD: We want Trump. We want Trump. Trump: Thank you very much. Don't go on Tuesday, February 6th. That's two days earlier. Don't do it. Don't use a mail-in ballot. Don't do anything. It's a meaningless event. There are no delegates. It's a con job. We could have done it, but we really want to do it the right way and the legitimate way. So don't do the sixth, do the eighth. Do the caucus, not the primary. The primary is meaningless. I don't know, maybe they'll try and use it for public relations purposes. Every time Trump supporters and they need something. What you have to do is caucus on February 8th. It's the only, it's the only way you can vote for President Trump. So caucus on February 8th. If you have any details or need anything, it's nv.donaldjtrump, did you ever hear of it, .com. Ok. So in conclusion, when we leave this 109 degree room from Henderson to Minden, from Elko to Reno and from Carson City to right here in Las Vegas, we stand on the shoulders of Nevada patriots, who crossed the ocean, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up those great skyscrapers, won two world wars and lit up the most beautiful lights anyone's ever seen right here on the Las Vegas strip. Together they built America into the single greatest country anywhere in the world. But now we're a nation in decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, its willpower and its strength. We are a nation that has quite simply lost its way, but we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Three years ago, we were a great nation and we will soon be a great nation again. It was hardworking patriots like you who built this country and it's hardworking patriots like you who are going to save our country. We will fight for America like no one has ever fought before. 2024 is our final battle. With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state. We will expel the war mongers. We will expel them. We're going to drive out the globalists. We will cast out the communist, Marxist and fascist, and we will throw off the sick political class that hates our country. We will route the fake news media and we will evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House on election day 2024. The great silent majority is rising like never before. And under our leadership, the forgotten man and woman will be forgotten no longer. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you, Nevada. Thank you. Get out and vote. God bless you.",""

The Dispatch reported on Thursday afternoon that the RNC was considering a resolution to recognize Trump as its presumptive nominee despite the fact that only two primary contests have taken place so far and Nikki Haley's continued presence in the race. The RNC historically stays neutral during the GOP presidential primary season. Subsequently, Trump reacted to criticism of the resolution by declaring that while he ""greatly"" appreciated the effort, he felt, ""for the sake of PARTY UNITY, that they should NOT go forward with this plan, but that I should do it the 'Old Fashioned' way, and finish the process off AT THE BALLOT BOX."" But according to Collins, Trump had initially favored the measure. Here's her report from Thursday night: In a Friday morning appearance on Fox & Friends, Haley said she was ""disappointed"" by RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel's endorsement of Trump, and blasted Trump for trying to name him the nominee already.

Pamela Evette, state Attorney General Alan Wilson and state House Speaker Murrell Smith, as well as Sens. Tim Scott and Lindsey Graham and Reps. Nancy Mace and Jeff Duncan.

I know Trump wants to be Putin, but we are not in Russia. Minnesota State Representative Kristin Robbins: I expect the RNC to vote this resolution down.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/369399",15322,"Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. Hello, UAW! Audience members. UAW! UAW! UAW! The President. It's great to be home. One of the best unions in the world. You look out for one another. And the whole country—the whole country—benefits from what you do. You know—please take a seat if you have one. [Laughter] You're tough as they come, starting with your president, Shawn Fain, a leader with backbone, a backbone like a ramrod. I don't know where he is, but he is. Together, we're proving what I've always believed: Wall Street didn't build America. The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class. That's a fact. Look, I kept my commitment to be the most pro-union President ever, and I'm proud you have my back. Let me just say I'm honored to have your back and you have mine. That's the deal. It comes down to seeing the world the same way. It's not complicated. You know, my dad—who never went to college; who was the smartest, toughest, most gracious man I knew; who managed a car dealership for the bulk of my life—taught me a very important lesson. He'd say: ""Joey""—this is the God's truth—""a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about decency. It's about your dignity. It's about your place in the community. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going be okay,' and mean it—and mean it."" Folks, that's what the UAW is all about, and it's always been that way. Just after the UAW was founded nearly 90 years ago, it launched what historians call the most important strike in the 20th century: Flint, 1936. Walter Reuther organized a sit-down in a factory. They weren't sure what would happen. They were worried about getting beat up. But they were determined. They were determined. And it took 44 days, but they won the first collective bargaining victory in American history. And the leadership of the UAW spread across the country and led to the first substantial wage increase in a long time, the first cost-of-living allowance, the first employer-provided health care. Within 4 years, workers across the entire auto industry unionized, inspiring workers across other industries as well, giving life to new industries in the labor movement. I share that history with you because all of you made history again. I'm confident—and I mean this—90 years from now, people are going to look back on the impact you had—you in this room. Just like them 90 years ago, you matter now. You lead. And I respect all of you here today. And you represent unions that always led, always lifted, and always inspired workers. The UAW legacy from Walter Reuther to Shawn Fain today—Shawn, you took a lot of heat, but you demonstrated extraordinary leadership. [Applause] You did. And that's what I saw a few months ago during your historic UAW strike—the time—this time in Belleville, Michigan. And I'll say I was so damn proud to stand on that picket line with you. It's not the first—it's not the first UAW picket line I stood in. In my home State of Delaware, I've done it many times. But it's the first time a President did it, I found out later. [Laughter] I've always fought for a strong auto industry, with UAW-built cars leading the world. This is what—it's about a simple proposition: You built these iconic companies. You built GM. You built—you built these companies. You sacrificed to save them in the worst of times. And you deserve to benefit when these companies thrive. As Shawn said, record profits mean record contracts. I'm serious. And that's what you got: record wage increases, winning back cost-of-living adjustments, greater retirement security, more paid leave, and eliminating tiers. [Laughter] Whoa, whoa, whoa. [Laughter] You all know my position. I'm tired—I've tried—you know, I'm tired about jobs going overseas, having products shipped to—look, during the Trump administration and a lot of administrations before that, what'd they do? So many—so many—people around America lost their sense of pride. Because whether it was an automobile company or any company at all, that factory that was there for 30 years. Hiring—they maybe only had 150 people in it, but it was a part of the community. Guess what? Corporate America found the cheapest labor in the world, and they sent the jobs to those laborers and sent the product back to us. But not anymore. We're building product here and shipping it overseas. Buy America and build America. [Applause] I mean it. And what's really important, you made sure the auto future of the world will be made in America. Oh, I mean it. You know, I'm going to digress just a second. Most people don't know that back in the thirties when Roosevelt was talking about the value of unions, he didn't just say unions are okay. He said any product that—in fact, that Congress—any money that Congress gives the President to spend, to build a product—whether it's an aircraft carrier, an automobile, a tanker, a staircase—no matter what that was, it should be built—— Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. UAW! UAW! UAW! The President. For—— Audience members. UAW! UAW! UAW! The President. But for a long time—for a long time—— Audience members. UAW! UAW! UAW! The President. For a long time, the Congress would make an appropriation and send it to the President to spend, whether it was building an aircraft carrier or staircase. And guess what? It was supposed to be built by an American worker with American products. Well, guess what? I'm going back to that. We build in America, and we buy American. And here is what you all did: You won commitments from the Big Three to create thousands of more jobs. So that's tens of billions more dollars. Building an auto future made in America. It wasn't just about what you did for the UAW workers. The fact is, you've transformed the entire auto industry that's not yet unionized—or, as we call that, the ""UAW bump."" Because of you, Toyota, Volkswagen, Nissan, Tulsa [Tesla; White House correction] all gave their workers double-digit raises. Because of you, workers across the country have seen the largest wage increases for workers building cars and trucks and any other transportation equipment in nearly 30 years. Thousands of these workers are already asking to join your union. Even before this, the UAW has been expanding its reach to workers in auto plants in—from auto plants to casi—to casi—casinos. [Laughter] You can tell I don't spend much time there. [Laughter] But guess what most people don't know what the UAW represents? Researchers in higher education and workers. And because of this union, I'm pleased and proud that you expanded the UAW to include 5,000 researchers at the National Institute of Health—UAW workers. I, honest to God, have always believed that the union movement in America is important because it produces the best skilled workers in the world. That's what happens. It's good for everybody. It's good for companies. It increases the quality of the jobs, the quality of the products. And it's good for economic growth. In fact, I asked—which is unusual for a President to do—I asked the Treasury Department to do a significant study—the most comprehensive report ever—detailing how unions are good for all workers, including nonunion workers; how they found that unions raise standards across workplaces in industry, improving skills and save—pushing up wages, strengthening the benefits for everyone. It matters. It matters, it matters. And some in corporate America are finally beginning to figure it out. And look at what we're doing—what's good for workers and companies. Since I took office, we've attracted billions of dollars in investment here in the United States. We supercharged advanced manufacturing, including electric vehicles made by union workers in America. China is determined—[applause]. China is determined to dominate that market, with EV predominantly made in China and Chinese jobs. The previous administration consent—was content to sit on the sidelines and let China take all these jobs, but I won't let that happen. [Applause] I will not. That's why I—[applause]. That's why I pushed and drafted the CHIPS and Science Act, investing more than $50 billion in manufacturing semiconductors here at home. Automobiles today require 3,000 chips—of these chips to be made. That's why my bipartisan infrastructure law is building a network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations all across America, installed by your brothers and sisters at the IBEW. That's who is doing it. And that's why the Inflation Reduction Act—which, the other team, not a single person supported—that I signed into law—dramatically—is a dramatic incentive for the Big Three and other auto companies to make it here—their future here in America with American jobs, jobs that we want to make union jobs. That's why I announced $12 billion to help companies that respect their workers implement a just transition to electric vehicle future. Because I strongly believe that companies transitioning to new technology should retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories in the same communities with comparable wages. And existing union workers should have the first shot at those jobs. As Shawn said, I appointed a historically pro-union National Labor Relations Board, because I don't believe any company should be using threats or tactics to stand in the way of workers' rights to organize. Period. And, folks, you've been very patient, sitting a long time. But these investments are paying off. Since I came to office—by the way, the last guy said he's looking for—he's hoping for a recession—— [At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.] ——[laughter]—because he does not want to be the next Herbert Hoover. He's already Herbert Hoover. [Laughter] He's the only President other than Herbert Hoover who lost jobs when he was President. Look, since I came to office, with your help, we've created 14 million new jobs—14 million—nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide. And that means we're creating American jobs and exporting American products instead of the other way around, like we saw for too long. Unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in 50 years, and it's going down. Wages are up; household wealth is up. We have the lowest inflation and fastest recovery of any major economy in the world. We have the fastest growing economy in the world. I know we have more to do. And we're making real progress. Over the last year, prices are down on everyday items from a gallon of gasoline to a gallon of milk. And folks are beginning to feel it. Last week, we saw one of the biggest jumps in how positive consumers are about—feeling about their personal circumstance. But we have more work to do. But our plan is delivering for the American people, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. That's what I said I was going to do—that's what I tried to do as a Senator and Vice President—but because, when we do that, the poor have a ladder up and the middle class does well, and the wealthy do well. Although, they should be paying a hell of a lot more in taxes. We all do well. It's called Bidenomics. If you notice, all the major economists who are talking about ""there's going to be a recession next week, next month""—they're all of a sudden—they're seeing the Lord. [Laughter] I'm a little worried; some of the major economists in American history are now giving me credit. You know, it's like, ""Oh, God, what's going on?"" [Laughter] But look, all kidding aside. This is a fundamental break from what used to be called trickle-down economics. And some Democrat Presidents did it as well as Republican. You know, I sat—not a lot trickled down on my dad's kitchen table growing up. There wasn't a lot. The idea was, if the wealthy do very well, there will be a lot left over, and it will trickle down to ordinary folks. Well, guess what? That trickle-down economy was supercharged by my predecessor. He cut taxes for the very wealthy and the biggest corporations. They shipped good-paying jobs overseas because labor was cheaper. It shrank public investment in infrastructure and education—invested less. It hollowed out entire communities, closing factories—I'm not making this up; you know this to be true—closing factories, attacking unions, and leaving too many Americans behind. In fact, when Donald Trump was in office, six auto factories closed around the country. Tens of thousands of auto jobs were lost nationwide during Trump's Presidency. During my Presidency, we've opened 20 auto factories and more to come. We've created more than 250,000 auto jobs all across America. And while I stood in solidarity with you on the picket line—as your president said, I went to the picket line; Donald Trump went to a nonunion shop and attacked you. [Laughter] Let me tell you something I learned a long time ago. If I'm going to be in a fight, I want it to be in a fight with you, the UAW—with you. [Applause] No, no, I mean it. We have a big fight in front of us. We're fundamentally changing the economy in this country. And everybody is getting a little worried about it, the very powerful. Some are seeing the light. But changing the economy—taking it from an economy that takes care of those at the top and changing an economy that gives people who built this country a fair shot. Getting back to my dad, all anyone wants is just a fair shot—just a fair shot, an even shot to be able to make it. That's what my economic plan is all about. That's what the UAW is all about. That's what the—your battle has been about. The days of working people being dealt out of the deal are over in this country as long as I'm President. Working people are going to get their fair share. You've earned it, you fought for it, and you deserve it. So today I want to say to all of you: Thank you, thank you. I could not be more proud or more honored that you've chosen to stand with me. Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. For all the progress we've made together, you're the real hero. I mean—I want to make it clear: You're the heroes of this story. It's not what I did; it's what the American people standing up with backbone did. You're the reason why. And I mean it sincerely. I'm supposedly an expert in foreign policy. I've known every major world leader for the past 25 years. And guess what? As I tell every world leader, remind them, whether they're an adversary or an ally, it's never, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against the American people—never, never, never. And that's been true throughout history, and it's still true today. Because of you—I mean this—because of you, I've never been more optimistic about America's future. We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. And I mean this: There is nothing beyond our capacity when we work together. We're the only nation in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went in. So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops, and God bless the American worker. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Every time I'd walk out of my grandfather—leaving his house up in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother would come to the door, and she'd say, ""No, Joey, spread it."" Let's spread the faith.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370448",4778,"By: George F. WillOnline here When Donald Trump won 20 of Iowa's 40 nominating delegates — 20 of the 2,429 who will be allocated nationally; 20 of the 1,215 needed to nominate — he declared the game over. Enlarging his emotional repertoire — leavening a barrel of petulance with a pinch of synthetic magnanimity — he said it is ""time now for everybody, our country, to come together."" Presumably, he was not inviting to this group hug those Americans he calls ""vermin."" After winning less than 8 percent of Iowa's registered Republicans, he received less than five percentage points more than a majority in New Hampshire. There, flanked Tuesday night by grinning, ring-kissing, cringeworthy toadies (Vivek Ramaswamy and Tim Scott, you are the sum of your choices), he declared the game over. As the game enters the bottom of the first inning — 62 delegates allocated; 2,367 not yet — the nomination is his to lose. However, he, who despises ""losers,"" is one. He, and the cult-cum-party under his tutelage, has lost the national popular vote twice, the presidency, the Senate and the House. His party spectacularly underperformed in the 2022 elections. And in numerous court challenges to the 2020 election results, he has compiled 20 fewer wins than the famously futile 1899 Cleveland Spiders baseball team, which went 20-134. Trump's wisdom makes him flinch from debating Nikki Haley. Readers who did not see her combative, soaring Tuesday night speech can do so on YouTube. They will then recognize that his wisdom is a coward's caution. On Feb. 24, South Carolinians can extend the nomination process into the middle innings — into March, giving voters elsewhere time to consider the following. Trump's inversion of conservatism is complete. His prospective program features higher taxes at home and retreat abroad. To be fair to him, it is simply beyond his poor powers of comprehension to understand that tariffs — he vows 10 percent on all imports from everywhere — are taxes paid by American consumers and producers. So, to a nation furious about inflation, he promises to raise the cost of living, especially for his lower-income idolaters, who necessarily devote disproportionate shares of their incomes to consumption. A reelected Trump could keep this promise because Congress has abandoned to presidents (who cite spurious ""national security"" and other ""emergencies"") its constitutional power to ""regulate commerce with foreign nations"" (Article I, Section 8). This should especially interest South Carolina — and other exporting and importing states, in the Southeast and elsewhere — that will vote on March 5, Super Tuesday, when more than half the number of delegates needed for the nomination will be selected. The Port of Charleston is one reason South Carolina's population is burgeoning. And one reason South Carolina has changed more, and more for the better, in the past 50 years than any other state. Upward of 400,000 South Carolinians have arrived since Haley left the governorship in January 2017, and the state was the country's fastest-growing by percentage in 2023. They might not know this, but many have become residents because of her. Haley — like some other South Carolina governors, but she more than any other — has made her state an economic dynamo, where unemployment is 3 percent. Trump, whose understanding of wealth creation is, like his wealth, wildly exaggerated, will dump sand in the dynamo's gears. In foreign policy, Trump, a leader obedient to his base, promises to ensure that Ukraine loses the war that he was sure would not occur. (In 2016, of Vladimir Putin: ""He's not going into Ukraine, okay? … You can mark it down. You can put it down. You can take it anywhere you want."") Trump, obsessing about the cost of U.S. assistance (a rounding error on the federal budget), is oblivious of the fact that almost 90 percent of U.S. dollars devoted to arming Ukraine are spent in the United States. His blinkered parsimony is ludicrous from someone who blithely presided over an $8.4 trillion increase in the national debt. South Carolinians should contemplate the deluge of measures likely if Trump, who has never had and never will have 50 percent approval, is a lame duck president in 2026, when Republicans will be defending 20 Senate seats, Democrats only 13. A Democratic Senate majority's agenda in 2027 might include ending the filibuster, packing the Supreme Court, instituting card-check procedures to vitiate unionization elections (and the South's attraction of investments), pursuing statehood for D.C., and much more. Haley's gallant ""game on"" message on Tuesday night might ultimately be unavailing. She is, however, standing alone against Trump possibly becoming the most valuable president progressivism has ever had.","","",""

National Review's Rich Lowry: All that said, if you had told me several months ago that she'd get 43% or so in New Hampshire, I would have been shocked. She has over-performed in this campaign, and done better than anyone but her loyalists would have expected. NBC's Ali Vitali: There is still a hopeful and excited attitude here, in large part because the margins just are not what they were expected to be…That was the only thing they wanted to prove they could do tonight; they wanted to prove they could make a go of it in a one-on-one race with Trump…that's a huge current we're watching Haley and her campaign continue to push against, as they continue to be defiant…This is a group of people who feel like they are fighting the establishment here. Politico's Burgess Everett: New: some of Senate GOP's remaining unaligned Republicans hope primary isn't over yet. Sen. Ernst says Haley is ""great …really proud of her. I think it's good to have that discussion and highlight the different candidates. So, I'd love to see her stay in."" USA Today's Ingrid Jacques: Trump wins New Hampshire, but if Haley drops out Democrats will get their wish. Don't do it. NBC's Ali Vitali: It literally looked like the boys club telling the woman to get out of the way. 7News Boston's Victoria Price: Not long after AP race call projecting Trump win, Nikki Haley takes the stage here in Concord at Haley HQ. Crowd is still energetic, and Haley is beaming. ""God is good!"" @7news #NHPrimary Atlanta Journal Constitution's Patricia Murphy: ??Nikki Haley in Concord says she's not dropping out of the race. ""New Hampshire is the first in the nation, it isn't the last."" Washington Examiner: Does Trump have the guts to stand with Haley? The Wall Street Journal: Nikki Haley earns the chance to fight on after New Hampshire Jon Karl, ABC News: You can't say she doesn't have a path, we've only had two states vote. They're small states. It goes to South Carolina, she got elected governor there twice by big margins, she was a popular governor. Charleston City Paper: Haley should stay the course and keep running National Review's Dan McClaughlin: So long as she can raise the money & stay above 20% of the vote, I don't see a downside for Haley in remaining in the race as long as possible.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370460",4659,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — Nikki Haley for President released a memo outlining the state of the presidential race as Granite Staters head to the polls in the first in the nation primary. With the political class and the DC elites lining up behind Donald Trump, the Haley campaign has a simple message: in America, we have elections, not coronations. Read the full memo here or below. Read more about the memo in the New York Times. To: Interested Parties From: Betsy Ankney, Campaign Manager Date: January 23, 2024 RE: State of the Race It's officially a two-person race. It's Nikki Haley vs. Donald Trump. We've come a long way in these 11 months. We started at 2%. We started with zero dollars in the bank. No one thought we had a shot. No one thought we could get it done. And here we are, $50 million dollars raised, over 200 stops, and 12 fellas later, and Nikki's still standing. The political class and the media want to give Donald Trump a coronation. They say the race is over. They want to throw up their hands, after only 110,000 people have voted in a caucus in Iowa and say, well, I guess it's Trump. That isn't how this works. Roughly 50 percent of Republican primary voters want an alternative to Donald Trump. Seventy-five percent of the country wants an option other than Donald Trump and Joe Biden. And while members of Congress, the press, and many of the weak-kneed fellas who ran for president are giving up and giving in – we aren't going anywhere. Nikki's been up against this before. No one in South Carolina thought she had a chance. The entire political class – including many who are now supporting Donald Trump – lined up against her. But she tuned out the noise, focused on the people, focused on doing what was right for her state and her country – and the voters responded. Nikki is the last hope to get our party and our country back on track. And we're going to get the job done. We've heard multiple members of the press say New Hampshire is ""the best it's going to get"" for Nikki due to Independents and unaffiliated voters being able to vote in the Republican primary. The reality is that the path through Super Tuesday includes more states than not that have this dynamic. Independents voting in primaries is nothing new – historically, GOP nominees have relied on Independents as part of their path to victory, including Donald Trump in 2016. But in 2024, Nikki Haley is the beneficiary of those Independents – in both the Republican primaries and the general election. That's why Trump's own pollster shows her beating Biden by 17 points. First up is Nikki's home state of South Carolina, which has no party registration, and anyone can vote in the Republican primary if they have not already voted in the Democrat primary. South Carolina elected Nikki as Governor twice, against the odds. As a state representative, she beat the sitting Lieutenant Governor, the sitting Attorney General, and a popular member of Congress. The people of South Carolina KNOW Nikki's strong conservative record because they lived it. After South Carolina, we head to Michigan, which also has an open primary, followed by a closed primary in Washington, DC, and caucuses in Idaho and North Dakota. Then it's on to Super Tuesday on March 5, where, despite the media narrative, there is significant fertile ground for Nikki. Eleven of the 16 Super Tuesday states have open or semi-open primaries. Of the 874 delegates available on Super Tuesday, roughly two thirds are in states with open or semi-open primaries. Those include Virginia, Texas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Vermont, all with favorable demographics. After Super Tuesday, we will have a very good picture of where this race stands. At that point, millions of Americans in 26 states and territories will have voted. Until then, everyone should take a deep breath. The campaign has not even begun in any of these states yet. No ads have been aired and candidates aren't hustling on the ground. A month in politics is a lifetime. We're watching democracy in action. We're letting the people have a voice. That's how this is supposed to work. And the choice voters face is clear. Do they want to focus on the past, or do they want a positive vision for the future? Do they want grievances and chaos and baggage, or do they want to get our country back on track? Do they want an 80-year-old man consumed by vendettas and confused by basic names and facts – that's both Trump and Biden – or do they want a new generation of leadership with the strength and competence to get the job done? And most importantly – DO REPUBLICANS WANT TO WIN? See y'all in South Carolina.","","",""

The narrow result speaks volumes about Trump's weakness going forward and Haley's surprising strength. ""The political elites never learn. The same naysayers who said Nikki Haley couldn't defeat a 30-year incumbent state legislator or win the governor's race in South Carolina are the same people declaring the presidential race over after only two states have voted,"" said Haley communications director Nachama Soloveichik.

Miscarriage—[inaudible]—— Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Yesterday—yesterday marked the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, which recognized a woman's constitutional right to choose, her right to make the deeply personal—— Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. We're going to have—this is going to go on for a while. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. We've got a couple more of these, I think. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. And, folks, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right, and so do a majority of Americans. And they still do. We all know what happened a year and a half ago: A new Supreme Court made an extreme decision overturning Roe v. Wade with their—with their Dobbs decision. Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. I'm sorry this is taking so long. Folks, the Supreme Court did what it never had done before: It ripped away a fundamental constitutional right that was in place for nearly 50 years and that was so important to so many Americans for so long. As I said on that day, the health and lives of women in this Nation would be at risk and the consequences of this decision. Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. That's exactly what happened. Today, in America, women are being turned away from—emergency rooms, forced to travel hundreds of miles to get basic health care, forced to go to court to plead to help to protect themselves and the ability for them to have children in the future. The cruelty is astounding. And it's a direct affront to a woman's dignity to be told by extreme politicians and judges to wait, to get sicker and sicker before anything can happen, even to the point where, as you heard, your life had been determined to be in danger. Or the idea that a woman should have to carry a fetus after she's been raped or the victim of incest—it's outrageous. It's outrageous. Or the idea—a woman receives competent medical advice that the fetus she is carrying won't live and will impact on her ability to have children in the future, and she still can't get medical care. I think it's unconscionable. Did anyone think—did anyone think that this is where America was going in 2024? Audience members. No! The President. I could go on. But look—and let there be no mistake—the person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump. Audience members. Boo! The President. Listen to what he says. Trump says he's ""proud"" that he overturned Roe v. Wade. He said, and I quote, there has to be ""punishment"" for the women exercising their reproductive freedom. He describes the Dobbs decision as a ""miracle."" But for American women, it's a nightmare. So let's be absolutely clear what Trump is bragging about. The reason there are 21 States where abortion bans are in effect, may [many; White House correction] with no exception for rape or any other—or incest, is Donald Trump. The reason women are being forced to travel out of State—— Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. This is going to go on for a while. They've got this planned. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. [Laughter] The reason women are being forced to travel across State lines for health care is Donald Trump. The reason their family members are trying to get help—them to—are threatened with—with prosecution is because of Donald Trump. And the reason their fundamental right has been stripped away is Donald Trump. And because of Donald Trump, doctors are fleeing their home States, setting up practices in other States, because they're afraid they'll be put in prison if they exercise their responsibilities. In States like Texas, doctors can get a life sentence for providing the care they were trained to provide. It's outrageous. Audience member. [Inaudible]—is a war crime! The President. And frankly, Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans—including the woman hollering—[laughter]. Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience member. Keep going! The President. And frankly, Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, including the Speaker of the House, are hell-bent on going even further. To date, MAGA Republicans in Congress have proposed three additional national abortion bans to criminalize health care in every State. Let me tell you what they are. First is a zero-week ban with absolutely no exceptions. The second one introduced is a 6-week ban with a penalty for violating it—jail. And the third is a 15-week ban, and the penalty is a 5-year jail sentence. You know, and they're in Congress now. In the past year, Trump himself endorsed a Federal ban, promising to ""lead the charge,"" God love him. [Laughter] And that means even if you live in a State where extremist Republicans are not in charge of the State Government, your right to choose, your right to privacy is still at risk. But as long as I have the power of the Presidency, know this: If Congress were to pass a national abortion ban, I will veto it. I will veto it. Look, MAGA Republicans—MAGA Republicans are trying to limit all women in America from getting a safe and effective medication— Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. MAGA Republicans are trying to limit all women in America from getting a safe and effective medication, approved by the FDA to—for over 20 years now. They're trying to block women from getting this medication even in States where women's health care choices are still protected. And if you live in a State where you cannot get care that you need and you make a plan to travel to another State to get the care you need, MAGA Republicans are trying to stop you as well. And get this. In the State of Alabama, the attorney general is threatening to prosecute family members who help their loved ones travel to another State to get healthcare they need. That can't be America—— Audience members. Boo! The President. That can't be America in 2024. It can't be. So let's be clear that the Dobbs decision also puts at risk the broader rights of privacy for everyone. That's because the fundamental right to privacy, which Roe v. Wade recognized, has served as a basis for so many other rights that are part of the fabric of this country: the right to make the best decisions for your health, the right to—use birth control, the right to marry someone who you love. Justice Thomas wrote as much in his concurring opinion in Dobbs that the future cases of the Court, he said, should be considered—reconsider all substantive due process precedents from Griswold on. That's what he said. Look—— Audience member. [Inaudible] [At this point, the President addressed audience members in the balcony.]  The President. Please don't jump. Folks, the extreme laws passed by Dobbs have no place in the United States of America. But what does have a place is your voice. The Dobbs decision practically dared women of America to be heard. In writing, they said, ""Women are not without electoral or political power."" No kidding. I said at the time, I don't think this Court and the MAGA Republicans have any clue about the power of women in America. I don't think they have any clue. But they're about to find out. Since the Dobbs decision, all over this country, from Ohio to Kansas, Michigan, Kentucky, Wisconsin, and right here in Virginia, Americans have showed up—women and men of all races, all backgrounds—voting to protect the freedom to choose. And there's one other person who doesn't have a clue about the power of women in America: Donald Trump. Audience member. [Inaudible]—genocide. The President. But look—— Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. What I said is, there's one other person who doesn't have a clue about the power of women in America. It's Donald Trump. But I promise you, in 2024, he's going to find out about the power of you all. We—[applause]. Oh, he—watch. We need the protections of Roe v. Wade in every State. And we can do it. You can do it. Together, we can do it. It's within your power to do it. So let me be crystal clear. Today isn't just a day to remember the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, today is a day to call to action. With your voice, with your power, with your vote, we can restore the protections that had been around for over 50 years under Roe v. Wade. We can—[applause]. We can—we can once again make it the law of the land in America. And we're going to do that. Are you ready to make it happen? Well, to do that, we need a new Congress. Are you ready to make that happen? Give me a Democratic House of Representatives, and give me a bigger—a bigger Democratic Senate, and we will pass a new law restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade, and I will sign it immediately. And let's remember: It was Donald Trump and his Supreme Court who ripped away the rights and freedoms of women in America. And it will be Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and all of you who are going to restore those rights for the women of America. Donald Trump is betting we won't—you won't vote on this issue. But guess what? [Laughter] He's betting we won't hold him responsible either, for taking away the rights. He's betting you're going to stop caring. Audience members. Boo! Audience members. We have daughters! The President. By the way—that you'll get distracted and discouraged and stay home. Audience members. No! The President. Well, guess what? I'm betting he's wrong. I'm betting you're the—won't forget. I'm betting you won't stop caring, that you won't get distracted. And I'm betting, come November, we will vote in a record number. And when we do that, we'll teach Donald Trump a valuable lesson: Don't mess with the women of America unless you want to get the benefit. Look, let me close with this. I believe 2024 is going to be the most important election we've had since 1864. I mean it. And the reasons are clear. Democracy is on the ballot. Freedom is on the ballot, like the freedom to choose; the freedom to vote; the freedom to love who you want; the freedom to go to work, go to school, go to your house of worship without fear of being gunned down by a weapon of war. So my question to you is simple: Are you ready? Audience members. Yes! The President. Are you ready to defend democracy? Audience members. Yes! The President. Are you ready to protect our freedoms? Audience members. Yes! The President. And are you ready to win this election? Audience members. Yes! The President. Let's get this done. Talk to your families and friends. Organize your community. Register to vote. Get people to the polls. And let's remember who we are: We are the United States of America. And there's nothing—nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. All right. You heard me say this before. Every time I'd walk out of my grandfather's house, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" Guess what? My grandmother would yell, ""No, Joey, spread it."" Let's spread the faith. Thank you.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370399",3957,"[As prepared for delivery] I congratulate Donald Trump on his victory tonight. He earned it. And I want to acknowledge that. Now, you've all heard the chatter among the political class. They're falling all over themselves saying this race is over. Well, I have news for all of them. New Hampshire is first in the nation. It's not last in the nation. This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go. And the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina! At one point in this campaign, there were fourteen of us running, and we were at two percent in the polls. Well, I'm a fighter. Now, we're the last one standing next to Donald Trump, and today we got close to half of the vote. We still have a ways to go, but we keep moving up. For a lot of people, politics is way too personal. It's not personal for me. I voted for Trump twice. I was proud to serve America in his Cabinet. I agree with many of his policies. I decided to run because I'm worried about the future of our country, and because it's time to put the negativity and chaos behind us. We have an economy that is crushing middle class Americans. We have a border that is totally open and dangerous, creating a disaster in our country. We have schools that are failing too many of our children. And we have a world on fire, with war in Europe and the Middle East, and a huge and growing threat from China. And then you look at Washington. We have a Congress that fights about everything and accomplishes nothing. And we have Joe Biden in the White House, making one bad decision after another, when he's making any decisions at all. Our country's in a real mess. And the question is, who's going to fix it? With Donald Trump, Republicans have lost almost every competitive election. We lost the Senate. We lost the House. We lost the White House. We lost in 2018, in 2020 and in 2022. The worst kept secret in politics is how badly the Democrats want to run against Trump. They know Trump is the only Republican in the country who Biden can defeat. You can't fix the mess if you don't win the election. A Trump nomination is a Biden win and a Kamala Harris presidency. I defeat Biden handily. With Donald Trump, you have one bout of chaos after another. This court case, that controversy, this tweet, that senior moment. You can't fix Joe Biden's chaos with Republican chaos. The other day, Donald Trump accused me of not providing security at the Capitol on January 6th. I've long called for mental competency tests for politicians over the age of 75. Trump claims he'd do better than me on one of those tests. Maybe he would, and maybe he wouldn't. But if he thinks that, then he should have no problem standing on a debate stage with me! Most Americans do not want a rematch between Biden and Trump. The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to win this election. I say it should be the Republicans! So our fight is not over, because we have a country to save. In the next two months, millions of voters in over twenty states will have their say. We should honor them and allow them to vote. And guess what, in the next two months, Joe Biden isn't going to get any younger or any better. We'll have all the time we need to beat Biden. When we get to South Carolina, Donald Trump is going to have a harder time falsely attacking me. The great people of South Carolina know I cut their taxes. They know I signed the toughest immigration bill in the country. They know we passed voter ID, and tort reform, and ethics reform, and they know we moved 35,000 people from welfare to work. Every time I've run for office in South Carolina, I've beaten the political establishment. They're lined up against me again. That's no surprise. But South Carolina voters don't want a coronation. They want an election. And we're going to give them one. Because we're just getting started! Thank you for the energy and love, New Hampshire! We're going home to South Carolina!","","",""

AUDIENCE: USA, USA, USA. TRUMP: Well, I want to thank everybody. This is a fantastic state. This is a great, great state. You know, we won New Hampshire three times now--three. And we win it every time. We win the primary. We win the generals. We've won it and it's, uh, a very, very special place to me, it's very important. If you remember in 2016, we came here and we needed that winner. We won by 21 points and it was great. And, uh, today, I have to tell you, it was very interesting because I said, ""Wow, what a great victory."" But then somebody ran up to the stage all dressed up nicely--when it was at seven, but now I just walked up and it's at 14--but she ran up when it was seven and, you know, we have to do what's good for our party. And she was up and I said, ""Wow, she's doing, uh, like a speech like she won."" She didn't win, she lost. And, you know, last week we had a little bit of a problem. And if you remember, Ron was very upset because she ran up and she pretended she won Iowa. And I looked around, I said, ""Didn't she come in third?"" Yeah, she came in third. And then I looked at the polls. She was talking about most winnability, who's gonna win? And I had one put up, I don't know if you see it, but I have one put up. We've won almost every single poll in the last three months against Crooked Joe Biden, almost every poll. And she doesn't win those polls. [cheering] And she doesn't win those. This is not your typical victory speech, but let's not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night, she had a very bad night. And you, uh, you have the now very unpopular governor of this state-- this guy he's got to be on something. [booing] I've never seen anybody with energy. He's like, uh, hopscotch. And, uh, you know, I'm watching this guy and two weeks ago he said, ""We're gonna win. We're gonna win in a landslide. We're gonna win."" About three days ago he started saying, ""Well, we wanna do well."" That's a big difference. But I walked out just now, we're 14 points up and I don't know what it's gonna be, but when she was up here, it was like six or seven and you know with like 7% of the vote counted. Now, uh, let me just tell you, we, uh, had an unbelievable week last week. And Iowa, we set a record. [cheering] It was the best in the history of the caucus, in the history! And, uh, I remember I sorta had the same feeling. I'm up and I'm watching and I said, ""She's taking a victory lap."" And we ki—we beat her so badly, she was-- But Ron beat her also. You know, Ron came in second and he left. She came in third and she's still hanging around. The other thing, she only got 25% of the Republican votes. I don't know if you saw that. Tremendous numbers of Independents came out, because in this state--because you have a Governor that doesn't frankly know what the hell he's doing--in this state, in the Republican primary, they accept Democrats to vote. In fact, I think they had 4,000 Democrots—Democrats--before October 6th. They already voted. Now, they're only voting because they want to make me look as bad as possible because if you remember, we won in 2016, and if you really remember it, if you want to play it straight, we also won in two thousand twenty. [cheering] By more! And we did much better in two thousand twenty than we did in two thousand sixteen. But as they said, we lost by a whisker, just by a whisker. No, no, no. But we can't let that happen. You know, you have to have people that speak up. I said, I can go up and I can say to everybody, ""Oh, thank you for the victory, it's wonderful, it's what--"" Or I can go up and say, ""Who the hell was the imposter that went up on the stage before and, like, claimed a victory?"" She did very poorly actually. She had to win. The governor said, ""She's gonna to win, she's gonna to win, she's gonna to win."" Then she, she failed badly. Now, I have here, if he promises to do it in a minute or less, but the only person more angry than let's say me, but I don't get too angry. I get even. [laughter, cheering] The only person, because he was there and he did fantastically well by the way, then he endorsed me. And we don't have to talk about Tim Scott, who by the way just got engaged. We have to tell you. [Turns to Scott standing behind him, cheering] And that's more important than all of this stuff. But a man that got to know her very well is Vivek [Ramaswamy]. I said, Vivek. I said, ""Vivek, go up and say a few words about it."" He has to do it in one minute or less, and then we're gonna just say, ""We had one hell of a night tonight."" And one other thing before Vivek comes. Do you see that poll? [points to his left.] We're gonna put it up. We have beaten Biden. You could almost say, ""Who can't? Who da hell can't?"" The man can't put two sentences together. He can't find the stairs off a stage. Who can't? But Vivek, one minute or less, go do it, Vivek. [cheering] VIVEK RAMASWAMY: What we saw tonight is America first defeating America last. That's what we saw tonight. If you want America Last, you can go to Joe Biden. You've got another candidate still apparently in the Republican primary, cut your social security to fork over more money to Ukraine so some kleptocrat can buy a bigger house. Go to Nikki Haley. But you know who delivered a double-digit victory tonight?--it is a double-digit victory as of right now--is this man Donald J. Trump the leader of America First. And that means something. [cheering] Now, USA and Donald Trump, America First. Now, I've got 30 seconds left. I want to make this point, here, OK? We gotta to say this, we gotta say this right. What we see right now with her continuing in this race is the ugly underbelly of American politics where the megadonors are trying to do one thing when we the people say another. And it's up to us, to we the people, to at long last say, ""Hell, no. We the people create a government that is accountable to us."" And we, the people have said tonight, ""We want again, as we did in Iowa, Donald J. Trump."" And so you want to actually speak truth, that's the truth tonight. And the only thing they're rooting for is an ugly thing that we don't wanna see happen. That's what these people are rooting for, is playin' to say long enough so the Reid Hoffmans and the ugly Democratic George Soros Juniors, who are funding the lawsuits against Trump, can prop up their puppet. We say no to that vision. I say the general election begins tonight, and this man will win it in a landslide. God bless you, Donald J. Trump. Vote Trump USA. [cheering, embraces Trump] TRUMP: Very nice. Wasn't that nice? So this was a great evening and I wanna thank everybody in the audience, and I wanna thank the people that are standing behind me. You know, uh, I--I think we called it right, immigration's a big deal, a big deal, a very big deal. We have millions and millions of people flowing into our country illegally. We have no idea who the hell they are. They come from prisons and they come from mental institutions, and it's gonna—it's just killing our country. And I'm talking about millions and millions and millions. They are drug dealers, they're everybody. And they come in just like, walking right through. There's nobody to check, and there's nobody to vet, and we have a man with us tonight, Tom Homan, who is—[cheering] central casting, he's central casting. And I'd like you to say a few words about the border, and who's gonna solve that problem, and how quick are we gonna do it, Tom. Go ahead, please. [applause] TOM HOMAN: Look, I worked for six presidents starting with Ronald Reagan, and every president I ever worked for did something to secure the border, but no one did more than President Trump. The most secure border in my lifetime. [applause] The most secure border we've ever seen. And Donald Trump's goin' a do it again. We're gonna lock the border down, and we're gonna protect Americans. Because what's happening at the border right now, a record number Americans have died from fentanyl poisoning, a record number migrants have died. A record number of women and children to sex traffic, a record number known suspected terrorists across the border. There's one man who's proven he can secure the border and he's standing to my left, Donald J. Trump. He's gonna do it again. [cheering] TRUMP: Thank you very much, Tom. So, this is an evening, uh, that I will not forget because it's the third time, but more importantly, uh, I think it's gonna be—it's gonna be the most important time. We won, uh, both—it was I think they said--somebody said, ""you rarely--if you win both--"" they've never had a loser, let me put it that way. When you win Iowa and you win New Hampshire, they've never had a loss. There's never been. So we're not gonna be the first, I can tell you. And I just, I just do wanna reiterate the polls--we're way up on everybody. We're way up on Biden. And over the last couple of months, if you check--and you have to remember in 2016, they were saying, ""Oh, what does he know about elections? He's not gonna win. He can't win. He can't w--"" We won, and we got millions, and you can check this, and I hope the cameras don't turn off 'cause they hate this, but we got millions and millions of more votes the second time, right, Mr. Congressman? Millions and millions of more votes, and, ah, but we had COVID, and they use COVID to cheat, and they did a lot of other things, too. We're not gonna let that happen, and that's still—and that's still goin' along. You can't forget--you can never forget history because if you forget, you never, you never recover from it and you repeat, you repeat. And we're not gonna repeat. We're gonna have the greatest election success. We're gonna turn our country around. And if you take a look throughout the history of our country, if you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of this not great country right now, it's a country in decline, it's a troubled country, it's a failing country frankly. But if you took the 10 worst presidents and put 'em together--the 10 worst, absolutely 10 worst. I used to say five. Remember I started, I'd say five. Then I said, ""Wait a minute, we can add another five."" They would not have done the damage that crooked Joe Biden has done to our wonderful country. They would not have done the damage. There's never been anything like it. And you say, ""Are they stupid people?"" I don't think so, because nobody can cheat that well if they're stupid. Do they hate our country? They must hate our country because there's no other reason that they can be doing the things they do. Take a look, the taxes, they want to raise your taxes times four. They want to let the Trump Tax cuts-- the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country--they want them to expire. Your taxes are gonna go through the roof. You take a look at regulations, they're throwing regulations. You can't breathe. You can't even breathe with what they're doing. You take a look at our border, so bad, there's never been a border like this in the world. Four years ago we had the safest, best border in the United States. I built hundreds of miles of border wall. And they always say, ""Oh, he didn't build hundreds of miles,"" because if there's a board laying on the ground, they say ""That's a renovation."" They call it a renovation. If there's two nails laying from 50 years ago, they say, ""Oh, that was a renovation."" These are very dishonest people and you're always fighting them. And just a little note to Nikki: She's not gonna win. [laughter] She's not gonna win. But if she did, she would be under investigation by those people in 15 minutes, and I could tell you five reasons why already. Not big reasons. A little stuff that she doesn't want to talk about. But she will be under investigation within minutes and so would Ron have been, but he decided to get out. He decided to get out. Now, Vivek, I don't think would be at all because he's perfect, right? [cheers] And Tim Scott, I know would never--that's no chance. Hey, Tim. Do you wanna say something? Come on, come on. I want him to say something. [applause] TIM SCOTT: Le--New Hampshire, the President said a double-digit win in New Hampshire and you delivered a double-digit win for President Trump. [cheering] But I'm gonna invite you to my home state startin' tomorrow. [cheering] Where this election--is over! It is time for the Republican Party to coalesce around our nominee and the next President of the United States, Donald Trump. Let's get that party started tonight. [cheering] TRUMP: What a good guy. What a good man he is. But just remember, I did hear Nikki say, ""And now it's off to South Carolina."" Well, I love South Carolina. Audience: We love you. TRUMP: I love it. But she forgot one thing. She forgot one thing. Next week it's Nevada. Next week it's Nevada, it's not South Carolina. We love South Carolina, but next week it's Nevada. And I'm pleased to announce we just won Nevada. [cheering] We just won, 100%. Because all of 'em, they looked at it, and they took polls, and I was polling at 95% to 4 or 5%, and they decided not to play in Nevada. So we just won Nevada. We have a man from Nevada here, Steve Wynn, wherever he may be. And John Paulson, the great John Paulson made plenty of money in Nevada. Doesn't live there, but he makes a hell of a lot of money. He makes money everywhere he goes, actually. So, money machine. Maybe we'll put you--you know what? Put him at Treasury. You want to make a little money? Let's put-- Anyways, good to have you guys. Uh, but we go to Nevada and that's been won, so we pick up all of those delegates. And then we do go to South Carolina where we've done really well, where I've done well. We have a great governor and lieutenant governor and great everything, because almost every one of them have endorsed me--two great Senators--which is hard. I mean, did you ever think that--she actually appointed you, Tim? And [laughs] think of it, appointed and you're the senator of the state and she endorsed me. You must really hate her. Naw, it's a shame. It's a shame—[Tim Scott steps forward to Trump's left shoulder] Uh-oh. [laughter] SCOTT: I just love you. [applause] TRUMP: No, that's-- That's why he's a great politician. [applause] That's why he's a great politician. So this is a great evening and it is-- We are going to Nevada for a little while. We're not gonna have to do too much. We have a great team there. But it's a team that uh we can now send someplace else. They did a fantastic job but, uh, we--and it's a fantastic place, really a fantastic place. But we'll be leaving there very quickly. We'll head out to South Carolina where I think we're gonna win easily. I think we're 50 points up, five-oh, five-oh. Fifty points up on a person that was governor, that tells you something. But I felt I should do this because I find in life you can't let people get away with bullshit, OK, you can't. [shouts and cheering] You just can't do that. And when I watched her in the fancy dress that probably wasn't so fancy-- come up-- I said, ""What's she doing, we won?"" And she did the same thing last week, but he was much more angry about it than I was. I said, ""Get up there and you let them know."" We are going to win this, we have no choice. If we don't win, I think our country is finished, I do. I believe our country is finished. We have an opportunity to do something so amazing. And the good news, and the reason we have such support--the best numbers I've ever had--the reason we have support is because they are so bad at what they're doing and so evil. And they're destroying our country. So I wanna thank everybody for being here. I wanna thank this group of people [gestures at crowd in front of him]. We will never forget you. We will never forget. [cheering] And I made a pledge—I made a pledge to your state that you have the highest energy costs in the country. In the first year, they're gonna be reduced by 50% because we are gonna drill, baby drill. Drill, baby drill. Inflation is going to come way down. But in the first year, your energy costs are going down by 50%. Thank you very much. We love you. Thank you very much. We'll see you soon. We'll see you on the trail. And thank you everybody, thank you very much. We will see you on the trail. Thanks. [Music: Sam and Dave: Hold on I'm Coming]","","",""

We're seeing young college kids come back into the fold with us. Because they want to see somebody who's going to be a new voice, a fresh voice, a fighter for them. That's what we care about. That's what we've always cared about is normal people. We don't care about the political class. We don't care about those that are trying to fight for the power of stuff. We want to just get normal people, and we want it to be in a way that they feel safe and they feel comfortable and they feel like someone's fighting for them. And I think that's what's missing in America right now."" *** ""And at the end of the day, you do results and policy. It's no drama with me. There's no personal feelings with me. This is about the fact that we have a country to save. I have a husband serving overseas. I've got a daughter who just got married, and I saw how hard it was for them to buy a home. We need to start making sure that we get the economy back on track, we get education back to the basics, we secure our border with no more excuses, we bring law and order back to our country, and that we prevent wars and start putting our enemies on their heels. That's what I want for America."" Haley on running against the establishment …  ""This is a marathon. It's not a sprint. The political and media elite say everybody needs to coalesce around Donald Trump. He literally got 56,000 votes out of a state of 3 million. That's it.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370417",1868,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — The Wall Street Journal editorial board lays out the stark choice facing Republican primary voters tomorrow and in the coming weeks and the questions they should ask themselves. Can Trump win the general election with indictments and court cases weighing him down? If he wins, can Trump deliver on his promises as a lame duck president, no mandate, and an increasingly divided country? With Trump on the ticket, will Republicans hold onto its razor thin majority in the House or will they lose it to Hakeem Jeffries? Will an ideologically incoherent Trump administration be able to deliver on any of its promises? With Trump in the White House, will Republicans be able to ward off a likely electoral wipeout in 2026? Read an excerpt below or the entire editorial here.   The 2024 Republican Choice A second, chaotic Trump term, or a new conservative beginning? Start with the fact that Mr. Trump would be an immediate lame duck. He can’t serve more than one more term, and if he does win it will be narrowly with little political capital. He has never reached an approval rating above 50%, and his rolling seven-week RealClearPolitics average favorability is 41.5%. If there’s a strong third-party ticket, he might win with the smallest plurality since 1912. Mr. Trump would lack the most potent presidential power—the ability to persuade. Republicans are favored to win a Senate majority, albeit narrowly. But the House is up for grabs and could easily go Democratic. If the first term is a guide, Democrats will oppose anything Mr. Trump proposes that isn’t one of their priorities. Mr. Trump could use executive power to repeal Mr. Biden’s regulations and appoint judges. He could approve drilling for domestic energy in particular. But if Democrats control either house of Congress, conservative legislative priorities would be dead on arrival.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370453",3822,"By: John E. SununuOnline here Donald Trump likes to portray himself as a winner. After his 51% victory in Iowa last week, he's making this claim to anyone who will listen. But Donald Trump has a record that stretches back 6 years, not just one week. Over and over, he's been directly responsible for loss after painful loss. In 2018, when Donald Trump said we'd get a ""red wave"" in Congress, we got wiped out. Democrats won the nationwide popular vote by nine points and gained a whopping 41 seats. On the Senate side, Democrats lost only two seats, despite facing one of the most unfavorable Senate maps in years. And in statehouses across America, Democrats gained a net seven governorships. There was a wave, alright – a blue one that crashed into Donald Trump. Then there's 2020. It was supposed to be the great GOP comeback after months of COVID shutdowns and skyrocketing crime in liberal cities. But with Donald Trump at the top of the ticket, Republicans got shellacked. Again. Democrats won the White House and the popular vote by five points. They took control of the Senate after Republicans lost BOTH Senate seats in what was once reliably red Georgia. As for the House, we gained a handful of seats, but not enough to regain the majority. We lost winnable races in state after state, even as candidates ran ahead of the president. Fast forward to 2022. With Biden in power and the economy in the toilet, Donald Trump once again predicted a red wave. He wasn't in office, but he was still the head of the party. He got involved in primary elections and anointed his preferred candidates in House, Senate, and gubernatorial races. What happened? Democrats bulldozed Republicans once again, gaining a Senate seat and defeating Republican candidates in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and New Hampshire — all seats that should have been winnable. In the House, Republicans managed to claw back the majority by the thinnest of margins. It wasn't Trump-backed candidates who got us there. It was regular Republicans in the suburbs. Now we're looking at 2024. Like the last three elections, Donald Trump is predicting a win — a win that will carry him back to the White House and sweep Republicans into strong majorities in the House and Senate. But the last three elections all but prove that's impossible. If he's our nominee, we're going to lose, and we're going to lose bad. Even against Joe Biden, the most beatable candidate in decades. I'm willing to give Trump some credit. He picked up rural voters and helped turn Ohio into a solid red state. He played a part in making Florida solidly red, too. But at what cost? He's chased away millions of Republican voters in the suburbs and lost far more states than he's gained. Arizona. Georgia. Colorado. The Rust Belt. He has no chance of gaining them back — not in 2024, and not ever. Donald Trump speaks with all the bravado and braggadocio of a winner, but his record is littered with losses all across America. Can any Republican win those states back? How about the suburbs, while keeping rural voters in the GOP? New Hampshire shows the way forward, as it often does. We're a swing state with a strong libertarian streak. Gov. Sununu has endorsed Nikki Haley, because she's just like him. She's a true conservative that can listen to others, take action, and get things done. That's why she trounces Joe Biden by double digits. A win that big would carry Republicans into office from the U.S. Senate to statehouses to school boards. In New Hampshire, a Nikki Haley victory in November could give us Republican representation in Congress, which we haven't had in a decade. Nikki Haley has never lost an election. She's a conservative voice that will take Republicans to victory in November. As a lifelong Republican, I am tired of losing. Aren't you?","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/369353",4420,"Greetings from Florida! The warmth of being home is a reminder of why I have chosen public service—from joining the United States Navy and serving in Iraq—to representing the people in the U.S. Congress—and now serving as governor of Florida. And it reminds me why I decided to run for President: to fight for those who have been forgotten in this country. This is America's time for choosing. We can choose to allow a border invasion or we can choose to stop it. We can choose reckless borrowing and spending or we can choose to limit government and lower inflation. We can choose political indoctrination, or we can choose classical education. These choices are symptoms of the underlying struggle to ensure that constitutional government can endure and that Western Civilization can survive. We launched this campaign to bring accountability to government, regain sovereignty at our border, and restore sanity to our society. We cannot succeed as a country if we allow our nation to be invaded, our currency to be debased, our cities to crumble, and our kids to be indoctrinated. The DC elites who have facilitated this mess do not care about you and they do not work for you; they work for themselves. They seek to accumulate power at your expense to pursue an agenda that is harmful to the American people. Citizens do not serve politicians; it is the duty of politicians to serve you. Talk is cheap. Actions speak louder than words. Reversing the decline of this nation requires leadership that delivers big results for the people we are elected to serve. I have a record of leading with conviction, championing an agenda marked by bold colors, delivering on my promises, and defeating the people who are responsible for our nation's decline. That is the type of leadership we need for all of America. Now over the past many months, Casey and I have traveled across the country to deliver a message of hope, that decline is a choice, and that we can in fact succeed again as a nation. Nobody worked harder. And we left it all out on the field. Now following our second-place finish in Iowa, we have prayed and deliberated on the way forward. If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome — more campaign stops, more interviews — I would do it. But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign. I'm proud to have delivered on 100% of my promises and I will not stop now. It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance. They watched his presidency get stymied by relentless resistance and they see Democrats using lawfare to this day to attack him. While I have had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear. I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear —a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism—that Nikki Haley represents. The days of putting Americans last, of kowtowing to large corporations, of caving to woke ideology, are over. I thank all of our passionate supporters who have stood by us through it all. That we had people volunteer to come to Iowa in the middle of a blizzard to knock on doors and make phone calls touched us dearly. No candidate had more thrown at him, but no candidate had so many committed volunteers and staff. Finally, I want to thank my wife Casey and our kids Madison, Mason, and Mamie. Casey has gone far above and beyond in her support for our campaign and for our cause. She is not only a great wife and mother; she is a great American, who cares deeply about the future of the country that our kids will inherit. Our kids have seen and done a lot on the trail, from playing on the famed Field of Dreams baseball site in Iowa, to making their first snowman in New Hampshire. They are one of the reasons we fight so hard for what we believe in. Winston Churchill once remarked that ""success is not final, failure is not fatal — it is the courage to continue that counts."" While this campaign has ended, the mission continues. Down here in Florida, we will continue to show the country how to lead. Thank you and God bless.","","",""

Watch Haley on Face the Nation below.   Haley on Donald Trump's mental fitness…  ""If you look recently, there have been multiple things. I mean, [Donald Trump] claimed that Joe Biden was going to get us into World War II. I'm assuming he meant World War III. He said that he ran against President Obama. He never ran against President Obama. He says that I'm the one that kept security from the Capitol on January 6th. I was nowhere near the Capitol on January 6th. But Margaret, don't be surprised if you have someone that's 80 in office — their mental stability is going to continue to decline. That's just human nature. We know that. First of all, you're talking about somebody who's only going to be in office for four years. I don't know if he was confused, I don't know what happened, but it should be enough to send us a warning sign. Look at Joe Biden, he's very different than he was two years ago. Are we really going to go into a situation where we have wars around the world and we're trying to prevent war and we're going to have someone who we can or can't be sure that they're going to get confused? It's a real issue. That's not being disrespectful. It's just a fact."" Haley on Trump's praise for dictators… ""I worked with Cindy and Fred Warmbier. They're amazing people and I will tell you as a parent, no parent wants to see their child return to them the way they saw Otto returned. I mean, this was a happy, smart kid. He went to North Korea and I mean the thugs in North Korea tortured him and returned him back in a state that is unconscionable. I told Fred and Cindy, speak up, get loud, I will help you. Let's partner — we're going to call North Korea out. I passed the largest set of sanctions against them in a generation by pushing China and Russia to do it. But what did Trump do? Instead, he talked about love letters going back and forth to Kim Jong Un. Cindy would contact me…she was so upset. And he went and said, 'oh, but Kim said that he wasn't aware of any torture that happened to Otto.' All you had to do was look at Otto when he was returned back to his parents. But this goes back to a pattern. I mean, we saw this over and over again…He congratulated China's President Xi a dozen times after China gave us COVID. He congratulated the Chinese Communist Party on their 70th anniversary. We don't congratulate the Communist Chinese Party. I remember at the United Nations, I had to sit him down and tell him to stop this bromance with Putin. I mean, you can't have someone who's trying to buddy up with dictators that want to kill us. Instead, you have to let them know what we expect of them."" Haley on draining the swamp…  ""I call out elected officials because I think they need to be accountable to the people. I call out Republicans and Democrats when they don't do the right thing. So it's not surprising that that set is going towards Trump because he's going to take care of them. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to take care of the taxpayers. I've always done that my entire career and I'll keep on doing it.""","","",""

His assessment of Nikki Haley: ""She's going to get smoked."" The candidate was close in his assessment, but missed the mark. As the saying goes, where there's smoke there's fire. There is plenty of smoke around Nikki Haley because she is catching fire here in the Granite State. She is catching fire for good reason. She is a smart, thoughtful, experienced candidate who is ready to be the next president of these great United States. She is easily the most qualified candidate on either ballot. Nikki Haley is an accountant by career and training. Nikki Haley is a mother. Nikki Haley is a military spouse. Nikki Haley is the child of immigrants. Nikki Haley has experience as a successful governor and a diplomat. It would be challenging to dream up a more solid resume for a candidate to guide our country through the troubled world which we face. Nikki Haley has the deft touch and nuance necessary of a leader on the world stage. This nuance has resulted in some unfriendly soundbites for Haley but we would encourage anyone given pause by a soundbite to do some research and dig into the details; you might be surprised. We can't say that she is perfect on every issue. No candidate can be. She ticks more boxes than any of the others and does so with enthusiasm and an infectious optimism. Of course, we can't talk about Nikki Haley without addressing the elephant in the room and the rather old donkey hiding in the White House. Nikki Haley is an opportunity to vote for a candidate rather than against those two. A candidate who can run circles around the dinosaurs from the last two administrations, backwards and in heels. She has the conservative mindset many Republicans want and the pragmatic ability to get things done that the whole country can get behind, especially the ever elusive and growing independent voters making up the silent majority. As the fictional Ian Malcolm says in Jurassic Park, ""The dinosaurs had their shot, and nature selected them for extinction."" The dinosaurs from the last two administrations have indeed had their shot and Nikki Haley is the fireball from the heavens to wipe them out. Putting forward a rematch of the last election means putting an octogenarian in the White House and putting a less-than-capable vice president in the on-deck circle. Haley has not been shy with the fact that she has at least a quarter-century age advantage on those candidates and she has a good point. Nikki Haley is in her prime and selflessly willing to give that prime to the country her parents chose to raise their family in. They knew it was the greatest country on earth and their daughter intends to do her part to keep it that way. Like many candidates before her, Nikki Haley came to visit this newspaper. Especially telling of her character was that she took the time to visit and meet every employee in the building. Most candidates live in a bubble where they are the center of attention at all times. Taking the one-on-one time that she did shows a humanity and humility this nation would be lucky to have in its leader. If you can select a Republican ballot on Tuesday, we urge you to select Nikki Haley as your next president. New Hampshire is ready for a change. America is ready for a change. The world is ready for a change. We want a better option than we have had for the past eight years, and Nikki Haley is that option. New Hampshire can prove that the independent-minded voters of the Granite State will not be told the election is a done deal. New Hampshire can prove that nothing is inevitable and send Nikki Haley home to South Carolina with a head of steam and nothing weighing her down as she sets her sights on defeating the ""inevitable,"" but very vulnerable, Democratic nominee.","","",""

The ad will air Monday across New Hampshire.   Click here to watch the ad. The ad contains excerpts from Warmbier's speech at Haley's campaign announcement 11 months ago. Warmbier describes how Haley encouraged her to stand up to North Korea and demand justice for Otto. Donald Trump played an important role in bringing Otto's body home and holding North Korea accountable, but he switched his tune when he ""fell in love"" with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Trump publicly absolved Kim of Otto's death, saying, ""I don't believe that he [Kim] would have allowed that to happen… And some really bad things happened to Otto — some really, really bad things. But he tells me that he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word."" Haley was critical of Donald Trump's reversal at the time. Led by dictator Kim Jong Un, the North Korean regime is widely known as one of the worst human rights violators in the world. The North Korean people suffer from mass starvation, forced labor camps, and imprisonment of political dissidents. They are denied all basic liberties, including freedom of speech and religious belief. Trump continues to praise Kim to this day. TRANSCRIPT CINDY WARMBIER: Seven years ago, I was a happy mom in the suburbs of Cincinnati, Ohio. My son, Otto, was invited to North Korea on an organized tour. He was taken hostage, tortured, and murdered by the government of North Korea. When we were begging the Obama administration for help, they told us to be quiet and be patient. Nikki told us the opposite. She told me it's okay to be afraid, like I am now, but I had to push through the fear.  She told us to be loud and fight back. To fight for justice. To fight for ourselves. And to fight for Otto. We passed laws in Otto's name, seized North Korean assets, and helped close down illegal businesses run by the North Koreans.  There's a lot of people in politics who will happily tell you how highly they think of themselves. Nikki isn't like that. She won't tell you about our private conversations. So I will. I will tell you about the texts and emails she sent me, making sure I was okay, fueling my resolve. I will tell you how she promised me she would do everything she could to make sure the world never forgot Otto.  I will tell you about her strength, her compassion, and her belief that every human being is worth fighting for. I will tell you that Nikki didn't help me because it was her job. She did it as a mom, a friend, and a fighter who made my fight her own. That's why I am here today. To tell you we need a leader in the White House who inspires us to become the best versions of ourselves. Who understands our fears and pushes us to conquer them. CINDY WARMBINER IN SOUTH KOREA, 2019: I want to look you in the eye and see evil, and face it, and know that as good people, we will win. CINDY WARMBINER: I am here to tell you that we need Nikki Haley fighting for all our children the way she fought for Otto. To tell you we need a patriot who reminds us every day that no matter what happens, we are blessed to be Americans. I am here to tell you Nikki Haley is that leader. That fighter. That patriot. Thank you and God bless America!","","",""

Haley on Donald Trump's praise for dictators… ""Well, what worries me is if you look at the fact he's someone who praises dictators often, and we've got a war in Europe, a war in the Middle East, you've got North Korea testing intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of hitting the U.S., and China on the march. And what did he do? He praised President Xi a dozen times after China gave us COVID. He has continued to say Kim Jong Un is a good friend and that they write love letters to each other. You can't deal with dictators like that. I dealt with China, Russia and Iran every day. They laugh at that. They don't take that seriously.  ""And we've got to make sure we're doing everything we can to prevent wars. My husband is deployed right now - I don't want any man or woman to have to go fight in a war. But in order to prevent wars, you've got to be at the top of your game, and you've got to make sure that you're letting those countries know what you expect of them. You can't have Biden and Trump… they're all caught up in investigations, they're all caught up in these other things. None of them are talking about the future of this country, and the vision in which we're going to go forward. That's a problem."" Haley on the importance of bringing people into the GOP…  ""To me, I don't sit there and push people away. I think that's the problem with the Republican Party. I bring people in. And what's happened with the Republican Party is they're deciding what's a good Republican, what's a bad Republican, who's the right Republican, who's the wrong Republican. Do we really want to get that? Because that's not how you win a general election. There was a poll that came out yesterday, and it shows that, in New Hampshire, I beat Biden. Donald Trump loses New Hampshire by 7 points. If you look at the general election head-to-heads [of Biden versus Trump], it's going to be a nail-biter of an election - I don't know if we'll win. On a good day, Trump's up by 2. I defeat Biden by 17 points. That's a Wall Street Journal poll. Trump called it a 'dirty poll.' That was his own pollster that did it!"" Haley on whose opinion matters... ""When you fight for the people, the people fight back for you. When you fight for elected officials and endorsements…that doesn't get you anything. They've wasted a lot of time on these endorsements. What I'm going to really fight for is making sure that I don't focus on the politicians. That's what we've done, and that's what will continue. We're getting hundreds of people in our rallies…last night, the night before - people want something different. It's not about liking Donald Trump or not. It's about the fact that we can't afford to not win in November. We can't afford to get this wrong.""","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370455",2849,"By: Jazmine UlloaOnline Here A 3-minute commercial set to run on Monday features a mother whose son died just after his release from North Korea. It may remind voters of Donald Trump's friendliness toward the country's dictator. Nikki Haley's closing argument to New Hampshire primary voters will include a three-minute ad featuring the emotional story of the mother of a college student who died shortly after North Korea released him from captivity in 2017, and whose cause Ms. Haley championed as United Nations ambassador. The ad, which the Haley campaign said would run across the state on Monday, is narrated by Cynthia Warmbier, the mother of Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia honors student from Cincinnati who was imprisoned in North Korea after visiting the country on an organized tour. ""He was taken hostage, tortured and murdered by the government of North Korea,"" Ms. Warmbier, who spoke at Ms. Haley's campaign kickoff event last year, is shown telling the crowd there. ""When we were begging the Obama administration for help, they told us to be quiet and be patient. Nikki told us the opposite. She told me it's OK to be afraid, like I am now, but I had to push through the fear."" Ms. Warmbier describes Ms. Haley as a fighter on the world stage and a leader with strength and compassion. The ad appears geared toward attracting, among other voters, the suburban women who have left the Republican Party in recent years and are a key constituency in New Hampshire and beyond. In portraying North Korea as evil and responsible for the young man's death, the ad may also remind voters of former President Donald J. Trump's frequent boasts about his friendly relationship with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. Ms. Haley has portrayed Mr. Trump as a destabilizing force in international relations who cozied up to dictators and terrorists. Ms. Warmbier and her son's story played a recurring bit part in the Trump administration. During Mr. Trump's 2018 State of the Union address, Ms. Warmbier and her husband, Fred, stood and wept as Mr. Trump described the ""menace"" of North Korea and paid tribute to Otto. It was later reported that North Korea had billed the United States $2 million for Otto's medical treatment before releasing him, though Mr. Trump denied paying the country anything. The Warmbiers later released a blistering statement after Mr. Trump met with the North Korean leader and said he believed Mr. Kim's claim that he did not know what happened to Mr. Warmbier while he was in captivity. ""Some really bad things happened to Otto — some really, really bad things. But he tells me that he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word,"" Mr. Trump said. But Ms. Haley said otherwise: ""Americans know the cruelty that was placed on Otto Warmbier by the North Korean regime,"" she wrote on social media.","","",""

Lie #1: Haley is courting Democrats to vote in the Republican primary. FALSE. Democrats cannot vote in the primary. They have to change their registration to Republican or Undeclared and the deadline to do so was Oct. 6, 2023. Lie #2: Haley wants to cut Social Security. FALSE. Haley wants to save Social Security from going bankrupt by raising the retirement age for workers in their twenties. Donald Trump himself proposed raising the retirement age to 70. Lie #3: Haley is not conservative. FALSE. Haley was a Tea Party governor who passed one of the toughest immigration laws in the country, voter ID, pro-life bills, tax cuts, tort reform, and more. As UN ambassador, she was tougher on China and Russia than Trump ever was. Watch Haley on Fox and Friends below.   Haley on Trump's lies…. ""It's irresponsible for the press to say this because Democrats can't vote in this primary. They haven't been able to change their registration for months. He's going out and saying I want to cut Social Security. I never once said I want to cut Social Security. And everyone's talking about the fact, 'is she a conservative?' I want you, Ainsley, you've known me a long time, how am I not conservative? I was a Tea Party governor, I passed voter ID, I passed the toughest illegal immigration law in the country, I cut taxes, I passed tort reform, we paid down our debt, I went to the UN, we cut a billion dollars. ""Just because the media says it, because Donald Trump says it...it's wrong. We've got to start telling the truth. And the problem with Donald Trump and Joe Biden is, they think if they tell Americans something, that it's the truth. But the problem is both of these guys are lying to the American people, and the American people deserve the truth. ""I am not going to do anything that is not going to be tough on the border, because I passed the toughest illegal immigration bill in the country. I'm going to be hard on China, and he wasn't hard on China. He praised President Xi a dozen times after China gave us Covid. There are multiple instances that we need to start asking Donald Trump the questions and stop taking what he's saying to be golden. ""Because I never once said I was going to cut Social Security, but he said he was going to raise the retirement age of Social Security to 70. He proposed a 25-cent gas tax increase on all Americans. He put us $8 trillion in debt in over four years, and our kids will never forgive us for that. ""What I'm telling you is it's not personal with me and Donald Trump. This is about, how do we save our country? I don't want my kids to live like this. We don't need to continue to live like this…. But the fact that Donald Trump is lying, it's another reason why he won't debate me because he knows I'll call him out on it.""","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370469",2708,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — Fact checkers are working overtime to debunk Donald Trump's many lies against Nikki Haley. Does Haley want to cut Social Security? False. Is Haley recruiting Democrats to vote in the New Hampshire primary? False. ""It's clear Donald Trump is terrified of Nikki Haley's rise, because the lies are coming fast and furious,"" said Haley communications director Nachma Soloveichik. ""The only person who wants to cut Social Security is Trump. Trump's refusal to save Social Security means 100% of Americans will face a 23% cut in Social Security benefits in less than 10 years."" Politifact: Trump ad says Nikki Haley's plan would cut Social Security for 82% of Americans. That's False Haley has never advocated cutting all Social Security benefits for everyone currently in that 82%. Trump's ad gives the false impression that Haley's plan would end or cut into older Americans' Social Security retirement. Haley's more limited plan wouldn't apply to current beneficiaries or anyone nearing retirement… A Trump campaign ad claimed Haley's plan ""cuts Social Security benefits for 82% of Americans."" The number is wrong. Haley's plan wouldn't affect current beneficiaries or Americans anywhere close to retiring, let alone 82% of the U.S. population. Politifact: Trump's misleading claim that Haley is seeking Democrats to 'infiltrate' New Hampshire's GOP primary We asked the Trump campaign for evidence and received no reply. Trump's statement is misleading. New Hampshire voters registered as Democrats cannot vote for Republican presidential primary candidates. People not affiliated with a party can vote in the primary, and Haley is courting those voters. In New Hampshire, the deadline to switch parties and vote in the presidential primary was Oct. 6, 2023. About 5,000 people changed their affiliation — the majority from Democratic to undeclared, according to the secretary of state's office. Washington Examiner: If Trump isn't scared by Haley, why is he attacking her? It then takes real gall for Trump and his campaign team to ape Democratic attacks saying that Haley advocates ""gutting Social Security."" (This is far from the only way Trump mimics liberal Democrats, but that's another story.) By straightforward logic, Haley's position that it will take action to save Social Security is one that would ensure more benefits for more people than Trump's ""do nothing"" approach. Yet here's what the Trump commercial says: ""Haley's plan cuts Social Security benefits for 82% of Americans."" Again, that is indisputably a lie, and indefensible. To affect 82% of Americans, Haley's plans would need to affect everyone under the age of 67 immediately. Again, that's false by nearly 40 years.","","",""

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Ron DeSantis today joined Your World with Neil Cavuto on Fox News Channel. The highlights are below. Watch part one HERE and part two HERE. On how he's the only candidate not running a basement campaign:  I've been up here a number of days in New Hampshire since Iowa, and I'm the only one that's not running a basically a basement campaign. I mean, I'm out there taking questions from the media. I'm doing town halls. I got two more today. I did one live on CNN and I committed to do both debates. We were supposed to do one on ABC WMUR last night, and then one on Sunday on CNN, but neither of the other candidates are willing to do it. It's just odd, because this first in the nation is really a tradition where the voters really kick the tires, and they ask you questions, and having a debate here is a tradition.  On how Democrats want Trump as the nominee:  We've got to just let voters know, hey, you know, what is November 2024 look like? How is Donald Trump going to navigate all the things that he's going to have to navigate? You notice the Democrats are licking their chops. The Democrats want to see Trump as the nominee. That is not anything that I think is a secret, because they have a playbook that they're going to roll out. And as soon as soon as they want to, they will. You're already starting to see these polls. There were so many polls saying Trump was going to be Biden in the fall. Now you're starting to see that shift. And my plan, my guess would be, if he shows up the nomination this spring, the media is going to be rolling out polls, showing that Biden has a strong lead going into the general election. So I think with me, people don't have to worry about any of that stuff. It'll be focused on their issues. It'll be focused on holding the Democrats accountable. And I do think we have the advantage when it's on issues. I think we have the advantage. It's a referendum on Trump, I think the Democrats have an advantage.  On why he's running for president: I didn't run to be somebody. I ran to do something. 2024 is a time for choosing for this country. If we have four more years of this, we're going to be in a tough time to dig out of it. I think it'll take a perhaps a generation. I've always been skeptical about Donald Trump's ability to win a general election. And I remain that. And so I couldn't have just sat on the sidelines, and not done it when I had the opportunity to make a difference. And we'll see how it ends up working out over the rest of the balance of the year. But leadership is about taking the reins, it doesn't matter if it's an uphill battle. It's not about trying to protect your own political hide. It's not about trying to position yourself down the road. If there's an opportunity to lead, you take it. And that's what we did. So that was the right thing to do. If I had been sitting on the sidelines, and Republicans end up losing in 24 people that would have said, 'you had an opportunity to do something and you didn't.' So anyone can sit there and carp on the sidelines. Get in the arena and fight for what you believe in.","","",""

Read the full piece below. I Want to Be a 'Live Free or Die' President Ron DeSantisNew Hampshire JournalJanuary 19, 2024 One of my favorite parts of New Hampshire is your state motto. 'Live free or die' is the motto I have led by in Florida, and it's the mindset I'll bring to the White House as president. On issue after issue, I have fought back against every government scheme on our freedoms. I protected citizens' Second Amendment rights and delivered constitutional carry for the people of Florida. I kneecapped big corporations from imposing their agenda and picking winners and losers in private business based on a political litmus test. I led the nation in unmasking central bank digital currency as a scheme of control and championed legislation to prevent it from ever being recognized. I put the indoctrination camps in our public universities out of business by defunding the discriminatory Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion cartel. And I worked hard to relieve people of the freedom-limiting burden of wasteful big government. I cut taxes for people on necessities, gas, baby items, and supplies. I reduced every Florida taxpayer's share of the state debt by actually paying down 25 percent of Florida's debt. While each American currently holds a share of over $100,000 of the national debt, Florida's per-person debt share is only $600. And I ensured future Floridians weren't burdened with uncontrolled government debt by running record budget surpluses year after year. We cut spending, we reduced our bureaucracy, and we still provided better services and infrastructure than New York or California–who spend much, much more. My record represents my attitude toward leadership: protect people's freedoms and enhance people's lives by keeping government small and fighting to proactively curb new schemes of government control. I'll do the same in the White House. But I'll do even more than that. I'll push for real government reforms as president to protect Americans' freedom for generations to come. I'll advocate for term limits on Congress so we have fewer career politicians using our government as their personal piggyback. I'll advocate for a line-item veto as president–and I'll use it to cut wasteful spending. And I'll advocate for a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution to force Congress to get its spending habits under control. Perhaps most importantly, I will close the southern border and hold the Mexican drug cartels accountable. Unrestrained illegal immigration steals freedom and opportunity from everyone. And illegal drugs like fentanyl coming across the border rob freedom from our future generations. This problem ends once and for all under my administration. We have it within our power to give a new birth of freedom to this country and usher in a revival of the American spirit. I envision an America where people are free to live, work, earn, and thrive. Support me in the coming New Hampshire primary, and I will embody the live free or die spirit as your next president.","","",""

Listen to the full interview with Hugh Hewitt HERE. On Nikki Haley's failure to impress her own home state:  I was on the ground doing town halls in New Hampshire the last two days. Nikki Haley cannot compete with Donald Trump there. And the fact that she can't do it there, she can't do it anywhere. She's certainly not going to do it in South Carolina. I did a rally a week. We had town halls Tuesday afternoon and evening, one on CNN scheduled for the day after Iowa. So I had the morning where we were basically just gotta get a little bit of recuperation. But I was like, You know what, let's just let's just use that time. So we went to South Carolina and did a rally, like 1000 people. I said, 'Hey, can you tell me what were the major accomplishments of Nikki Haley when she was governor?' I did not have anyone raise their hand. That is not going to be a state that is conducive.  On his opposition to Biden's recent spending deal:  It should be dead on arrival. We have an unprecedented crisis at our border where we've had over 8 million people come in illegally from all over the world, including from hostile nations with hostile populations. And yet, Biden is basically just green lighting it. When he's asked for money in the past, it hasn't been to stop the illegal immigration. It's been to process more illegals. And we're now in a situation where New York City is closing down a school, sending the kids home so they can commandeer it to house illegal aliens. It's crazy. And of course, this has made us vulnerable to terrorist attacks. So I think the Republicans should insist on the border problem being solved. I mean, I do think that that means border wall. But I also think that that means cleaning up the legal language that has allowed him to abuse his power like parole, and the like, and they should just hold firm. The public is with the Republicans on this. This is Biden's issue of all the issues that he's handling, and he's unpopular on most, this one is like the worst. He's got the worst ratings that any President has ever had on immigration and the border, you guys can win this fight just hold firm.  Listen to the full interview with Jack Heath HERE. On how Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are running basement campaigns:  I mean, Nikki spent an ungodly amount of money. You know, in New Hampshire, that was not our strategy. Our strategy was, you know, really do well in Iowa. And then New Hampshire was a momentum state. Obviously, Trump did well in Iowa. And so I think he's benefiting. I don't think Nikki has any chance against Trump in New Hampshire. So that's just kind of the way the cookie crumbles. But I do think that the voters really take the first of the nation seriously. I'm the only candidate at this point that's not running effectively a basement campaign, because Biden obviously has nowhere to be found as expected. Trump doesn't debate or take questions. And now Nikki Haley won't debate or take questions from voters. And so I was scheduled to do the WMUR debate tonight with ABC and no one else agreed to do it. And then the last few days, I've been in New Hampshire taking questions from voters, taking as many as I can get in in the allotted timeframe. I think that's what Granite Staters expect. And I think when they see candidates like Nikki, who's basically hiding from the voters at this point, giving remarks than just getting off the stage and not debating, I do think that that registers with them because I think they take their responsibility seriously, to probe these candidates, to vet the candidates and to kick the tires. And what happens is, you know, like Chris Christie said, when on the hot mic, you know, she's just not up to this. And I think the fact that she's not willing to do that is a really bad sign for her. I do think it'll hurt her in New Hampshire, because I think the voters expect it.  On why he is running:  The country is at a time for choosing and we gotta get it right. And we need somebody that can win like I want in Florida. But then more importantly than that, deliver on these on these issues, all the stuff we talked about border, crime, inflation, budget, all the things that Republicans have wanted to do for years, and quite frankly, Donald Trump promised to do and didn't deliver on it. So now is the time for choosing. I think this is the election. I've never run for things because I'm trying to earn a position. I've run for things because I want to do something on behalf of the people I represent. So when people say oh, you can wait, well, I don't know what 28 is gonna look like then I may not have the calling, then. I had the calling now. I think that the party supporting me would lead to great results over an eight year period and a legacy that would last a quarter century. So you have to do that. Obviously with Trump in, it's more difficult and I take these polls with a grain of salt like you do, but you know, the polls, when they have him up big nationally, when they take him out, you know, we run away with it in terms of in terms of the other Republicans. And so you know, I think you got it you got to do what you got to do. I've been taking it from all sides. But you know what, I'm still here.","","",""

He was starting another year-long overseas deployment. This is Michael's second deployment. The first was to Helmand Province in Afghanistan in 2013. Saying goodbye again was tough for me and our two kids, but Michael is doing something important. He and his brothers and sisters in arms are protecting our family and our freedom. Thank God we have people with the courage to fight for our country—to fight for what matters. And when I came back to New Hampshire, I recommitted to taking up that fight in the best way I could. I'm running for president to restore an America that's strong and proud. New Hampshire has that same fighting spirit. It's reflected in its large veteran community and summed up in your motto, ""Live free or die."" You know, we must defend the liberties that make America the most blessed country the world has ever seen. And you know that if we don't—that if we fail to stop the chaos that surrounds us—America may be lost. Has America ever had chaos like this? We see it in the drugs killing our children after flooding across the Southern border. We see it in the overwhelming majority of students who aren't proficient in reading or math. We feel it when we pay more at the grocery store or the gas pump. We see war in Ukraine and Israel—and China is getting ready for an even bigger war over Taiwan. Joe Biden is the author of this chaos. We have to defeat him in November and solve the problems facing our country. But we can't beat Democrat chaos with Republican chaos. That's what Donald Trump is. All breaking, no fixing. All vendetta, no vision. My vision for America is clear. Stop wasteful spending and hold both parties accountable. Secure our border and stop illegal immigration—no more excuses. Get our children reading and education back to basics. Bring law and order back to our streets. Become not just energy independent, but energy dominant. Rebuild a booming economy that benefits everyone, like I did as governor. And stand up to Russia, Iran, and Communist China, like I did as ambassador. This vision unites New Hampshire, which is why Gov. Chris Sununu endorsed me. But ultimately, it can unite America. That's why I'm the only candidate who beats Joe Biden by double digits. And a victory that big means a conservative landslide from school boards to the U.S. Senate. We will have a mandate to stop the chaos and save America. That's why I'm running—to save the freedom that called to my parents and convinced my husband to serve in uniform. That's worth fighting for. It's worth dying for. And it's absolutely worth living for.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370463",7811,"By: Glenn KesslerOnline here Nikki Haley may have served as ambassador to the United Nations during the presidency of Donald Trump, but now that she's threatening his lead in New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Tuesday, he and his super PAC are attacking her as too liberal to be the Republican standard-bearer. ""Nikki is a Globalist RINO,"" Trump fumed Monday on his social media platform, Truth Social, using an acronym for ""Republican in name only."" (Never mind that before former New Jersey governor Chris Christie dropped out of the race last week, the super PAC flooded independent voters with mailers tying her to Trump in an effort to drive those voters to Christie.) This ad begins by reflecting the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler — that immigrants are ""poisoning"" the country — and charges that Haley is ""too weak, too liberal, to fix the border."" It underscores this point by twice using a clip of Haley saying: ""We don't need to talk about them as criminals. They're not."" Indeed, the ad claims that she ""refused to call illegals 'criminals'"" and that she opposed Trump's plan to build a wall along the border. None of this is true. We dug up the original clip from which this ad was crafted. This ad is a textbook case of how political campaigns dishonestly snip comments made by opponents so that they are untethered from reality. The Facts In July 2015, when Haley was still governor, she appeared on a panel with three other Republican governors at the Aspen Institute, where they had a wonky discussion on issues such as health care, the economy and immigration. Just a month earlier, Trump had descended the Trump Tower escalator and announced he was running for president. In his speech, he especially attacked immigrants from Mexico: ""They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" Moderator Walter Isaacson turned to Haley and asked her: As a child of immigrants from India, ""what do you feel about the tone of the immigration debate as it's recently turned?"" Haley responded first by decrying illegal immigration — and, notwithstanding the ad's claim that she opposed a border wall, endorsing one. ""I have always believed … we're a country of laws,"" she said. ""That's what's made us strong. We have to always be a country of laws. So it's incredibly frustrating for a lot of people when they see the illegal immigrants being able to come across. It really is astonishing that after all these years, D.C. can't figure out how to build a wall."" (A couple of months later, in an appearance before the National Press Club, Haley also called for a wall that was part of a comprehensive immigration strategy: ""Don't say you're just going to build a wall. Because a wall is not going to do it. You've got to have commitment of ground troops, equipment, money, all of that to bring it together. Then you're being serious about tackling illegal immigration."") In the Aspen talk, she then turned to legal immigration. ""Having said that, we are a country of immigrants,"" she said. ""I am the proud daughter of Indian parents that reminded us every day how blessed we were to live in this country. They resent when people come here illegally."" The quote that the MAGA super PAC uses comes from the next section, when she addresses the original question about tone. We will show the section that the ad uses in boldface. After watching the clip several times and discussing it with colleagues, we have concluded that Haley is making these comments generally about all immigrants, not just those who enter the country illegally. But the comment is open to interpretation. ""But let's keep in mind these people that are wanting to come here, they want to come for a better life, too,"" she said. ""They have kids, too. They have a heart, too. So we don't need to be disrespectful. We don't need to talk about them as criminals. They're not. They're families that want a better life, and they're desperate to get here. What we need to do is make sure that we have a set of laws that we follow, and that we go through with that."" In context, Haley appears to be expressing sympathy for people who are seeking entry to the United States, illegally or not. But she emphasizes again: ""What we need to do is make sure that we have a set of laws that we follow, and that we go through with that."" Finally, she concludes, in a possible reference to Trump's rhetoric: ""So, you know, I think that some things have been said that have been unfortunate and wrong. But I think we also need to remember, especially for all of us, I say for Republicans, [that] tone and communication matters, and people matter. And we don't ever need to talk about this in a coldhearted way."" (Elsewhere during the panel discussion, she explicitly mentioned Trump's tone: Calling him a supporter and a friend, she said: ""He is creating a very combative tone in a time where we really need to be able to vet our candidates. Every day, I feel like I'm hearing Mr. Trump attack another person personally."") The ad charges, ""Illegals are criminals, Nikki. That's what illegal means."" Conservatives tend to refer to ""illegal immigrants,"" but there's a reason the more neutral term is ""undocumented immigrant."" It's against the law to enter the United States without permission — but being present in the United States without documentation is not a crime. That's a civil violation — unless someone was previously deported and then reentered in violation of a deportation order. In 2021, nearly 900,000 people entered the United States legally but overstayed their visas, according to government statistics. Until recently, there were far more cases of travelers overstaying their visas than there were southern border apprehensions. People also can be granted asylum even if they arrive without proper documentation. The ad cites a statistic in a Fox News report — that Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2022 arrested about 44,000 noncitizens with criminal histories. That's a relatively small percentage of the population of nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants. ICE's annual report shows that the leading charges were drugs, immigration offenses, traffic offenses and assault. As a governor and as a presidential candidate, Haley generally has taken a tough line on illegal immigration. In 2011, she signed into law a bill that requires police to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest for another reason and suspect may be in the country illegally. Running for president, she said that she would assign thousands of immigration agents to handle deportations and that the roughly 4 million undocumented immigrants who arrived under the Biden administration ""absolutely have to go back."" Alex Pfeiffer, a MAGA Inc. spokesman, sent a statement defending the ad. The statement ignored Haley's opening comment about the United States being a country of laws and bemoaning the inability of Washington lawmakers to build a wall. ""She is clearly referencing those people who are breaking America's immigration laws when suggesting we 'don't need to talk about them as criminals,'"" he said. ""Nikki Haley is okay with people resenting them, just not okay calling them criminals — our ad highlights that point."" The Pinocchio Test We hold attack ads to a high standard and judge especially harshly any ad that we deem to be manipulated video. This ad twists a snippet of a long answer that Haley gave about improving the tone of the immigration debate — and falsely suggests that she supports people who enter the country illegally. Whether she was explicitly talking about undocumented immigrants may be open to debate — but not that her words were taken out of context.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370464",4747,"By: Judge Judy SheindlinOnline here I've seen a lot of politicians come and go during my life, and I am not someone who suffers fools. It takes a lot for me to support any one candidate so strongly. But Nikki Haley's integrity, intelligence, energy, and experience speak for themselves. And I know that she's more than ready to take on the world's toughest job as President of the United States. In a sharply divided southern state, Haley was elected not once, but twice as Governor of South Carolina. As the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, she distinguished herself with tough leadership and a powerful defense of American interests. What I admire most is that she's always sought consensus – not with watered-down compromise, but with common sense solutions. And she gets results, not with baloney and bravado, but with hard, clear-eyed work. Simply, Nikki Haley is the only candidate in the 2024 race with true executive gravitas. Trump was elected President with zero political experience. While no one should deny his acumen as a businessman, he is not a leader. A leader unites people, instead of dividing them. A leader protects the nation from chaos, instead of creating it. A leader projects moral authority and sets ethical standards for our children and grandchildren. Donald Trump does none of what America needs in this critical moment. As for Joe Biden, I've never seen greatness or anything close to it in his 53-year political career. Just consider the last three years. He's actively encouraged illegal immigration – leaving states, cities, and towns in chaos and on the brink of financial disaster. We need strong national leadership to bring this nightmare to an end. At home, Americans are struggling with punishing inflation, a housing crisis, and a palpable fear that our best days as a nation are behind us. Abroad, we're embroiled in horrific military conflicts that we could and should have prevented. Do you really believe Biden has the focus and drive to solve any of these problems? He created them in the first place! We need new leadership, new ideas, and a renewed commitment to the idea that, as Americans, there's far more that unites us than divides us. So I urge you to join me in supporting Nikki Haley. It's easy to imagine her in the White House, making a difference and re-establishing American strength. She has a masterful and deep command of the international stage and is respected by friend and foe alike. As U.N. Ambassador, she talked tough to dictators, telling them America would never be bullied or backed into a corner – and that's exactly what we need in an increasingly violent, unstable world. Neither Biden nor Trump would know a Houthi from a salami unless someone whispered in their ear or spelled it out for them on a teleprompter. We need a president like Haley who knows what's happening – because that's essential to knowing how to respond. If you are a Republican angry at?the weaponization of the justice system, fine. But don't get even by electing a former president who has so little respect for the system to begin with. If you are a Democrat who has never voted for a non-Democrat, get over it. That's no reason to return mediocre leadership to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for four more years. It's time for all of us to think like Americans. Not like Republicans or Democrats. It's time to elect a candidate who can heal our national wounds. We also all know that our next president will need extraordinary strength and stamina to handle the world's most demanding job; Nikki Haley is 51 years young. Let's be honest here: I am 81 years old, and I run a successful business. I am considered the matriarch of a family of twenty. I work out every day and have an active social life. Do I have strong opinions about the world we live in? You bet I do. But I would never have the chutzpah to tell you that I have the same stamina I had a decade ago, and surely not two decades ago. There's plenty you can do in your 80s. Being President isn't on the list. So don't let Trump and Biden fool you. Neither of these men are up to the job and its relentless demands. Neither has the energy – let alone the vision – to bring us together and end the political wars that have torn us apart. Nikki Haley speaks to Americans honestly, without condescension. She does this without insult, or demeaning and divisive language. She is eager to work with all of us—Independents, Democrats, Republicans—to get America back on track. She has earned my vote – and she deserves yours, too. The hour is late, America. We can't waste what may very well be our last chance to get this right.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370588",8486,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – NBC News today released an article titled ""New Hampshire Republicans 'disappointed' Nikki Haley isn't fighting harder in the state."" Read the full article below. New Hampshire Republicans 'disappointed' Nikki Haley isn't fighting harder in the state Jonathan Allen and Henry Gomez NBC News  January 17, 2024 As Republicans here seek a standard-bearer, Nikki Haley is making herself scarce, and GOP insiders say that could doom her long-shot bid to beat former President Donald Trump in Tuesday's primary. Haley has forced the cancellation of two planned debates in New Hampshire — one sponsored by ABC News and the other by CNN — by refusing to go toe-to-toe with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Her schedule is light on campaign stops in a state where candidates typically pack their days with events. And, since failing to identify slavery as a cause of the Civil War last month, she has stopped taking questions on stage from voters. Haley's team is gambling that less of her will end up being more in a race that is down to three candidates, with one of them — DeSantis — already having decided to pack it in and move his fading campaign to South Carolina. That's a bad bet, said Dave Carney, a veteran New Hampshire-based Republican strategist who described the state's history of vetting presidential candidates through free-flowing town hall-style forums as sacred. Haley's refusal to debate and take questions at her first post-Iowa event in the state could kill her campaign, he said. ""As an incumbent, maybe, or somebody who's a front-runner — sure, you're ahead, you're not taking any risks,"" Carney, who is neutral in the race, added. ""But when you're in second place? You need to throw f---ng Hail Marys. You have five nights left."" A Haley spokesperson did not reply to a text message seeking a response to the Republicans who spoke to NBC News for this story. In interviews with more than a half-dozen Republican officials and party strategists familiar with New Hampshire presidential primaries, NBC News found none who thought Haley would benefit by keeping her distance from voters. But she is also dealing with the reality that her uphill battle became steeper when businessman Vivek Ramaswamy dropped out of the race Monday and threw his support to Trump. ""Everybody in New Hampshire is disappointed"" about Haley choosing not to debate, said Julianna Bergeron, a Republican National Committee member from the state who has not endorsed a candidate. She said declining to take questions from voters on the stump gives off a similar vibe and that Haley's highly controlled campaigning could turn off voters who are still undecided. ""I can't be positive,"" Bergeron said, ""but, yeah, I do think it matters."" A Suffolk University/NBC10 Boston/Boston Globe poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters released Wednesday showed Trump leading at 50%, followed by Haley at 34% and DeSantis in a far distant third, at 5%. DeSantis has majorly downshifted in New Hampshire, emphasizing South Carolina, where he hopes he can surprise and surpass Haley, the state's former governor, and prolong his struggling candidacy. But while he has lowered expectations for his performance in next week's Granite State primary, Haley has raised hers, declaring after Iowa that she and Trump are now locked in a two-person race. Haley's decision to avoid news debates, which Trump has been skipping since they began last summer, gave DeSantis more license to bolt from New Hampshire. But it didn't free Haley from the assumption that she would campaign harder here. She has long made clear that the state was central to her strategy, famously telling voters in New Hampshire in early January that they would ""correct"" the outcome of the Iowa caucuses. ""She rose to prominence and then they put her in a bubble,"" said Michael Biundo, a longtime GOP strategist in New Hampshire who worked as a senior adviser to Ramaswamy. ""She is behind,"" Biundo added, ""and to cancel on debates, and to treat New Hampshire like it's not the first in the nation and it's just one of the Super Tuesday states — which is what she's treating it like — I think is a huge mistake. We have a different way of thinking here."" Because the debates are a portal to large audiences, rather than the smaller town hall forums, the choice to scratch them particularly sticks in the craw of Republicans who believe voters should have a chance to assess candidates by the way they answer questions. ""The decision for ambassador Haley not to have a debate seems imprudent,"" Republican state Rep. Bill Boyd said. He called her approach a ""huge missed opportunity"" to reach out to undecided voters like himself. ""Anything that happens between now and Tuesday is going to factor into my decision-making,"" he said, adding that he was ""frustrated"" by her choice to snub the ""time-honored tradition"" of using debates in the state to talk to voters here. But the question-and-answer sessions that have made New Hampshire voters famous — or notorious — for eliciting raw responses from candidates are essential to the state's political identity. Traditionally, candidates criss-cross the small state in a wild sprint between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, speaking to as many as four or five separate audiences in a single day. At the end, they almost always open themselves up for rhetorical poking and prodding from the crowd. ""If somebody's pandering or not telling the truth, you don't need the press to call them out here in New Hampshire,"" Bergeron said. ""Because somebody at one of the house parties will call them out."" The combination of the short window between contests, the ease of traveling from one end of the state to the other, and settings more intimate than arena rallies makes New Hampshire uniquely situated for what amounts to a quadrennial week-long political Lollapalooza. Haley has good reason to understand that: Not only had she held more events than her remaining rivals between the last week of May and Jan. 24 — 46, to 43 for DeSantis and 7 for Trump — but she watched DeSantis' numbers in the state plummet after he chose not to take questions from voters or the media earlier in his campaign. But Haley appears to be moving in the opposite direction. In the state that now represents ground zero in her battle against Trump, Haley since Tuesday has held one public event, with one more scheduled for Wednesday night: a rally with Gov. Chris Sununu, her most prominent New Hampshire endorser. Haley also has been giving a stripped-down version of her stump speech and ending without taking questions for weeks, though she often stays afterward to take pictures and make small talk with attendees. (She also accepted questions during ""telephone town halls"" she held to replace events canceled due to bad weather last week.) Her new format raised eyebrows in Iowa, but it became even more noticeable Tuesday when she did the same at her single New Hampshire event. ""I'm the only one that's not running a basement campaign,"" DeSantis said during a campaign stop Wednesday in Hampton, N.H. While some New Hampshire Republicans were critical of Haley for not running an even more aggressive campaign there this week, DeSantis is ceding the state and Trump is only appearing for nightly rallies. Voters are still getting bombarded with ads in their mailboxes, but the diminished presence of GOP candidates is pronounced. Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., a longshot Democratic candidate, has announced more public events than any of the Republicans through the end of this week. ""Avoiding the press is not a winning strategy, and at this point hoping for a good showing is like receiving a participation trophy,"" Rick Gorka, who served as a spokesperson on Republican Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, said of Haley. ""Might make you feel good, but it's pointless."" Haley has added two stops to her schedule later in the week, and there could be more in the offing. But some supporters here say they have concerns that Trump's lead has grown since Ramaswamy dropped out and endorsed him following the Iowa caucuses. ""The Ramaswamy departure from the presidential race is likely to widen the gap between President Trump and Nikki Haley in New Hampshire,"" said one Haley donor in the state. Sean Van Anglen, a onetime Haley supporter who says he is now undecided, expressed disappointment at her debate decision and her light schedule. ""Seems like Haley has given up,"" he said.","","",""

Read the full article below. Nikki Haley under pressure from donors to defeat Donald Trump in New Hampshire after Iowa caucus loss CNBC  January 16th, 2024  Brian Schwartz Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley is facing pressure from some of her top fundraisers to either seriously compete with, or outright defeat, Donald Trump in next week's New Hampshire primary, after finishing third Monday in the Iowa caucus. ""I would still like to see her get somewhere, but the mountain she has to climb is enormous,"" Andy Sabin, a New York businessman and Haley fundraiser, told CNBC. ""As much as I like Haley, I don't even know what Trump could do to stop himself right now."" Sabin plans to help raise money for Trump if Haley doesn't make it through the primary season, despite previously telling CNBC he wouldn't give the former president ""a f---ing nickel."" ""He may be the only choice I have,"" said Sabin. Several Haley fundraisers who spoke to CNBC conceded that, unless she gets a very close second to Trump or manages to pull off an upset win in New Hampshire, the race could effectively be over for her after that. New Hampshire ""is critical. If she wins there, and she can, it will be a long primary season,"" said Eric Levine, an attorney and bundler for Haley. Levine is also the co-host of a Haley fundraising event scheduled for after the New Hampshire primary. He told CNBC he isn't worried about poor attendance, as long as she has a strong showing in the Granite State. ""She needs to win or a very, very close second place,"" said a lobbyist who is raising money for Haley. In order to keep many of her more affluent donors engaged, Haley must get within three percentage points of Trump in New Hampshire, said a Republican fundraising advisor whose clients include Haley donors. If she does not, these donors could turn away from Haley and try to find other ways to stop Trump, including possibly by financing a third party effort like No Labels, said the advisor. A Haley campaign spokesperson did not return a request for comment before publication. Trump is facing dozens of federal criminal charges, many related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Nonetheless, the former president dominated the Iowa caucuses, winning over 50% of support from caucusgoers. Polls in New Hampshire do not predict Haley faring much better there than she did in Iowa. Trump leads in the Granite State primary by about 14 percentage points over Haley, according to a Real Clear Politics polling average. A plethora of wealthy Republican leaning donors have rallied around Haley as their alternative to Trump, even though he is still poised to capture the GOP nomination. To keep the campaign going after New Hampshire, she will need their help, as well as any small dollar donor money she can get, in order to try to fend off Trump in her home state of South Carolina. Trump is leading Haley in the South Carolina primary by 30 percentage points, according to a Real Clear Politics polling average. Haley and her allied political action committee have spent over $26 million on advertisements targeting New Hampshire voters, according to AdImpact. Trump and his allied PAC have invested over $12 million on ads in the state. Some Haley donors have already lost hope. In Davos, Switzerland, a wealthy investment banking executive and Haley donor told CNBC Tuesday that he's now convinced Trump will be the Republican nominee, and go on to defeat President Joe Biden in November. The banker, advisor and lobbyist were granted anonymity in order to speak freely.","","",""

MANCHESTER, N.H. – Just one day after the Iowa Caucuses and following a busy morning with two events in South Carolina, Ron DeSantis joined CNN for a town hall in New Hampshire hosted by Wolf Blitzer. The highlights are below. Watch parts ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, AND SIX. On why Haley and Trump owe it to New Hampshire voters to debate:  The tradition here with first-in-the-nation is something that's very significant. I agreed to do a debate with WMUR and ABC on Thursday, and with CNN on Sunday. I'm the only candidate that actually agreed to come to New Hampshire to debate, and what does that say? We have four candidates for president now: Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, and me. I'm the only one who's not running a basement campaign at this point. You deserve, as a voter, to have the candidates come up, answer your questions in forums like this, have somebody like Wolf moderate a debate where you go back and forth...we've gotten away from, 'Hey, let's make let people make these decisions' to almost like, you know, just let the media coverage determine what's going on. I don't think that's what we want in a republican form of government.  On Nikki Haley's defeat in Iowa:  She said and her campaign said that there's only two tickets out of Iowa, that the top two out of Iowa would be valuable, and that she would finish at least second, and then that would be the race. Well guess what happened? Even though she spent 100% of her money attacking me, and not one red cent attacking Donald Trump, and I faced almost 50 million in total, I got in second, and she did not. And that's just the reality. And here's the thing. In Iowa, you can actually show up as a Democrat on the day of the caucus, change your registration, and then participate in the Republican caucus. In New Hampshire, you can't do that.  On the danger of a Trump-Biden rematch for the country:  We have a choice as Republicans: what do we want the 2024 election to be about? And with me as your nominee, it'll be about holding Biden accountable on the economy, on the border, on crime, on the problems internationally, on the growth of government and the bureaucracy, bringing accountability for COVID, ending weaponization of federal agencies and then offering a way where we can restore the American Dream and get the get the nation's fiscal in order. I think we win if that's how the debate is. If Donald Trump is the nominee, the election will revolve around all these legal issues, his trials, perhaps convictions, if he goes to trial and loses there, and about things like January 6. We're going to lose if that's the decision that voters are making based on that. We don't want it to be a referendum on those issues. We want it to be a referendum on the country going in the wrong direction. And a candidate like me being a president, that can reverse the decline. And here's the thing. Yeah, we talk about issues that are important for sure. And there's some things that need addressed right away. But me as President, I view this election, not just for eight years, but really things that are going to impact this country for a quarter century. And if you're not thinking down the road that long, then you're just not going to be able to do what we really need to do so that America remains the last best hope on Earth. I just don't think we're going to succeed if all those issues are front and center on voter's minds, and so we have an opportunity to choose and choose well.  On the need to secure the border:  First of all, I think this is part of the problem with an open border, because you're incentivizing some really perilous behavior. There's people that are paying large amounts of money to coyotes and drug cartels to be brought into this country. There are people being abused sexually, there are people that are being trafficked that are in the country and the US is incentivizing this. It's madness. So stopping the migration and having a closed border is the humanitarian thing to do now. I am going to empower the states to be able to enforce immigration law. I don't think that Texas should have to sit there and deal with all the consequences of the federal government in neglecting their duties. And I think that's been a problem with the Biden administration...so we're going to work together with the states and the local sheriffs. So you're not going to have these conflicts like that exist right now, between Biden and Texas, or between Biden, and local sheriffs in places down in Texas.  On why he decided to join the military:  I played baseball all the way through college, and I wanted to do that as long as I could, if I couldn't play then be involved in it somehow. And then 9/11 happened. And 9/11 really changed how I viewed the world, because I grew up in the 80s and 90s, particularly the 90s. It was like a holiday from history, we didn't seem to have a care in the world. And that was a reality that brought to our shores when those terrorists killed those 3000 people. And so our nation was in conflict. I didn't get anything in terms of money special, I gave up a lot of money in the private sector that I could have been able to do in order to serve. But I just felt that I'm blessed to be an American, blessed to be born and raised in this country. We were in conflict, and I felt that I should raise my hand and serve. And so we raised our hand to serve and also volunteered to go to Iraq. At the time, I was not forced to do that. It was something that I wanted to do. So I was there in 2007 and 2008 time period. And I learned a lot about what veterans go through, what our service members go through, what happens when they come home. And I'm going to put veteran's issues on the front burner as commander in chief.  On what he learned from his baseball career:  From the time I could walk, I was involved with baseball. This was kind of my passion. And I think what baseball teaches you is one, you learn to deal with failure. You could be the best hitter in the league, and you're failing 65% of the time. And that wasn't always easy for me as a kid. I get upset if I didn't get a hit. But you learn how to do that, you learn how to come back next time. You also learn, it's a combination of individual sport, but also a team sport. When you're in that batter's box, no one else can do it, but you see the ball, you hit the ball, either do it or you don't. But then in the grand scheme of things, you need to be able to get runners on base, you know, people drive people in, you need to play good defense and to do that. So it's a combination of individual initiative, as well as a team sport.  On keeping woke indoctrination and ideology out of universities:  The US is not a racist country, and we've overcome things in our history. I think the Founding Fathers, they established a set of principles that are universal. Now, they may not have been universally applied at the time, but I think they understood what they were doing. They understood that those principles would be the engine for progress for generations to come. And that's what's happened. I think the Republican Party stands for merit and achievement and colorblindness, that is what we should stand for. So for example, in Florida, I've eliminated things at our universities like this DEI deal. They say it's diversity, equity and inclusion, but it's really very ideological, and they're trying to impose an agenda. I think the way it's actually practiced, it stands for discrimination, exclusion and indoctrination. And it's wrong let's not divvy people up based on race, ethnicity, or gender. Let's treat people as individuals, not as members of group. Of course, we'll all come together and there say there should be no discrimination against anyone based on that. But that's not just discriminating against ethnic or racial minorities. Of course you don't do that. It also means you don't discriminate against white and Americans or in the university setting, you don't discriminate against Asian Americans just because they tend to have to have high performance.

They were writing our obituary months ago. They even called the election before people even got a chance to vote. They were just so excited about the fact that they were predicting that we wouldn't be able to get our ticket punched here out of Iowa. But I can tell you, because of your support, in spite of all of that they threw at us, everyone against us, we've got our ticket punched out of Iowa. And what I what I learned by going around Iowa is that this country has a basic decency. We've got hardworking people, God fearing people, patriotic people. You just don't see it every day because of all the nonsense that gets spewed out there, by the media, by social media, all this other stuff. People want to have hope for this country's future. And that's what we represent. We represent a chance to reverse the madness that we've seen in this country, to reverse the decline of this country and to give this country a new birth of freedom and a restoration of sanity. That's what we are going to do. So we have our marching orders. Our marching orders are to do all we can to preserve what George Washington called the sacred fire of liberty, the same fire that burned in Philadelphia in 1776, when our founding fathers signed the Declaration of Independence. The same sacred fire of liberty that burned at a cemetery in Gettysburg when our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, pledged our nation to a new birth of freedom. The same sacred fire of liberty that was on the beaches of Normandy in 1944, when our band of brothers stormed those shores and helped free the world. The same sacred fire of liberty that was at the Berlin Wall in 1987, when Ronald Reagan stood there and said, 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.' This is our responsibility to carry this torch and to preserve this sacred fire of liberty. Don't run away from this responsibility. We welcome this responsibility. We thank you for your effort. We thank you for your support. You helped us get a ticket punched out of the Hawkeye State. We have a lot of work to do, but I can tell you this as the next President of the United States. I am going to get the job done for this country. I am not going to make any excuses. And I guarantee you this: I will not let you down. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you so much.""","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370462",4211,"WEST DES MOINES, Iowa – With Nikki Haley's strong finish in the Iowa caucuses and as she heads to a one-on-one match-up against Donald Trump in New Hampshire, Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney released a memo outlining the state of the race. Read the full memo here or below. To: Interested PartiesFrom: Betsy Ankney, Campaign ManagerDate: January 15, 2024RE: State of the Race As an ex-president, Donald Trump has always been running as a quasi-incumbent. Voters know what they think of Trump and whether they want more of him or prefer an alternative. In Iowa, Trump frequently predicted a win by a 60-point margin. He won by 30%. In a state in which caucus voters are among the most pro-Trump of any electorate in America, he got 51%, and 49% preferred someone else. That's far from the ringing endorsement of Trump that the media portrays. The race now moves to less Trump-friendly territory. And the field of candidates is effectively down to two, with only Trump and Nikki Haley having substantial support in both New Hampshire and South Carolina. That never happened in the 2016 nominating contest, when a larger field allowed Trump to win many primaries with pluralities rather than majorities. Historically, incumbent presidents who have struggled in New Hampshire have failed to recapture the White House. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson won 48% of the vote in the New Hampshire Democratic primary. He withdrew from the race 19 days later. In 1976, President Gerald Ford won 49% of the vote in the New Hampshire Republican primary. That set the stage for a protracted nominating contest and ultimately Ford's loss in the general election. In 1992, President George H.W. Bush won 58% of the vote in the New Hampshire Republican primary. That precipitated an extended nominating contest and ultimately Bush's loss in the general election. Currently, Donald Trump's RCP average vote share in New Hampshire is 43.5%. That is historically bad, trailing far behind Johnson, Ford, and Bush's final numbers. Trump's weakness with Independents is well established. But a number in the low forties also indicates significant weakness with New Hampshire Republicans too. The Iowa results and the New Hampshire polls show Donald Trump is more vulnerable than commonly believed. He is the polarizing figure he has long been. Trump and Biden are the two most disliked politicians in America. Around half of Republican primary voters want more of Trump and around half prefer an alternative. That is the picture of a seriously contested nomination. With Nikki Haley as the last one standing against him, Trump has drawn a tough opponent. By coming from far behind and outlasting 12 other candidates, Haley has shown the strengths, skills, and resources needed to go the distance in a long campaign. As a successful Governor and Ambassador, Haley has the executive and national security experience a president needs. As a proven conservative, Haley has done as much or more than Trump on immigration, debt, taxes, education, and a host of other issues of concern to primary voters. As a member of Trump's Cabinet, who left the administration with glowing praise from Trump himself, claims that Haley is not in touch with the Trump wing of the party fall flat. In fact, Trump's own super PAC is advertising in New Hampshire that Haley is a strong supporter of the MAGA agenda. At 51 years old, Haley presents the generational contrast with octogenarians Trump and Biden that most Americans are seeking. Unlike Trump and Biden, Haley is not consumed by grievances of the past. Voters don't see her as someone who will bring more chaos and negativity to the White House. Her vision of a strong and proud America is where the country wants to go. Haley routinely performs better than Trump in head-to-head matchups against Biden. With Trump, it will be another nail-biter election, likely followed by endless legal disputes. With Haley, it will be a landslide. After the Biden-Harris disaster, Republicans want a winner. As the race moves to New Hampshire, the choice before voters is clear: the rematch no one wants between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, or a new generation of conservative leadership with Nikki Haley.","","",""

I came to Iowa early and often. And I kept coming back . . . even though the cold weather is brutal. The kindness of Iowans will never be lost on me. You're faithful, patriotic, hardworking Americans. At one point in this campaign, there were 14 of us running. I was at two percent in the polls. But tonight, Iowa did what Iowa does so well. The pundits will analyze the results from every angle. But when you look at how we are doing in New Hampshire, in South Carolina, and beyond, I think we can safely say . . . Tonight, Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race! Tonight, I'll be back in the great state of New Hampshire. And the question before Americans is now very clear. Do you want more of the same, or do you want a new generation of conservative leadership? I've spoken a lot of hard truths to America. And here's another one: I voted for Donald Trump twice. I was proud to serve in his administration. But when I say, ""more of the same,"" you know what I'm talking about. It's both Donald Trump and Joe Biden. They have more in common than you might think. Seventy percent of Americans don't want another Trump-Biden rematch. A majority disapprove of both of them. Trump and Biden are both about 80 years old. Trump and Biden both put our country trillions of dollars deeper in debt, and our kids will never forgive them. Trump and Biden both lack a vision for our country's future . . . because both are consumed by the past, by investigations, by vendettas and grievances. America deserves better. We deserve a new direction under new conservative leadership. We deserve a president who will focus on the needs of our people, not on themselves. A president who will rebuild our economy, close our border, and stand up to our enemies. Most importantly, we deserve a president who will stop our self-loathing, end the division and fear, and make America strong and proud! Our campaign is the last best hope of stopping the Trump-Biden nightmare. But it's more than that. Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections. That's nothing to be proud of. We should want to earn the support of a majority of Americans. All the evidence says that if it's a Trump-Biden rematch, it's going to be another tossup election. It could go either way. We could have more disputes over election interference. And Joe Biden could win again, with Kamala Harris waiting in the wings. Lord, help us. And then look at what happens when I go head-to-head against Biden. We win in a landslide. It's not even close. That means no recounts, no lawsuits, and no doubts.?It means no more Chuck Schumer leading the Senate. No more endless votes for House Speaker because we'll have a huge House majority. We'll term limit the do-nothing Washington politicians. We'll rebuild our economy and secure our border. And make no mistake, we will restore our national pride. We are blessed to live in America, and it's time we remembered that. And as we head to New Hampshire, I have one more thing to say: ""Underestimate Me. That's Always Fun."" I love you, Iowa!

""What I saw at the United Nations was not that Israel didn't want a two-state solution. The Palestinians didn't want a two-state solution. Every agreement that was put on the table, the Palestinians rejected right off the bat. The Palestinian Authority is not serious about a two-state solution. They want a one-state solution. They want to eliminate Israel and they don't want Israel to exist. You've got to look at this in reality, not in political scenarios. This is the fact that the Palestinians don't want Israel to exist. Israel has come to the table more times than they need to and at the end of the day, look at what happened on October 7. Israel needs to defend and protect their people in every way possible."" Haley on her husband being deployed... ""This is what military families do every day. I'm no different. We didn't know that he was going to get deployed, but we're so proud of him. And you know, when I'm awake, he's asleep. When he's awake, I'm asleep. And thank God for him and the military men and women. We get to FaceTime about once a week. But I text him and he responds when I'm sleeping and he texts me and it's vice versa. But you know what I'll tell you is when I watched him and those 230 soldiers pick up their two duffel bags of belongings to go to a country they've never been, all in the name of protecting America. They're willing to sacrifice their lives and their families because they still believe in this amazing experiment that is America. So if they're willing to sacrifice for us there, shouldn't we be willing to fight for America here? Because we have a country to save."" Haley on Trump and Biden...

DES MOINES, Iowa – With just one day left until the Iowa Caucus, Ron DeSantis is everywhere. He started off the morning by joining five Sunday shows. Read the highlights below. Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream  Watch the full interview HERE. On how his ground game and organization will pay off on Monday night:  We've worked harder than anybody. I think if you look at what we've done, just look over the last couple, a couple of months. I mean, we've been everywhere, doing town halls, in the early states, getting endorsed by people like Governor Reynolds, winning these debates, not just in the Republicans, but even against a Democrat like Gavin Newsom. So we've been working hard, we've been doing a great job. I think Monday is going to be the pivot point where now that people start to actually vote. I think it's going to really help change the landscape in terms of some of the narratives that have been there. But there's not been a candidate that's worked harder. There's not been a candidate that's put in more work. And I think particularly here in Iowa, Iowans notice that. Iowans care about it. You're not entitled to be nominated. You don't just swoop in and get coronated. You got to earn it, and we've earned it.  On the dedication from his supporters in Iowa and across the country:  We got a great path going forward. We're going to do well on Monday. We've got an unbelievable organization, we've got large numbers of Iowans that have committed to caucus for us that are going to show up. They just kind of roll their eyes at these polls because the idea that you're going to be able to poll a caucus, much less a caucus in negative 20 - good luck doing that. And so we've worked very hard over the last six months to go to all 99 counties, to build the organization, to get people at their doors committed. And so we're looking forward to it. We've done it the right way. And historically, when you have the energy on the ground, which we do, when you've gone to all 99 counties, when you have the organization, that's what you need to do to do well in a caucus, but particularly in these conditions, because there's going to be every excuse in the world for someone to say, 'you know what, maybe I'm not going.' Our folks are motivated. They're going. They're on a mission. We've got people from all over the country that have come to in the middle of a blizzard to Iowa just to make phone calls for us, to knock on doors and tell Iowans why they want to see me be the Republican candidate next president. And so what's on the ground is special for us.  Today in Iowa Sunday, WHO13  Watch the full interview HERE. On what he learned from visiting all 99 counties in Iowa:  I've visited all 99 counties. We've taken questions everywhere we've gone. We've engaged with the folks. We've learned a lot from people here in Iowa. We've seen a lot of problems with our country. But then I was able to see a lot of decency, a lot of people that are patriotic, God-fearing, hardworking -- and that's really the ingredients that are going to help us turn this country around. So I think I'm a much better candidate as a result of having visited the counties and done the caucus the way you're supposed to do. And I think it'd make me a better president for having gone through this process. So I think it's a good one for this country. I think it's good for the Republican Party. And though we've been able to amass a significant amount of support of people that are raring to go to caucus for us, and so I'm looking forward to tomorrow night.  On what makes Iowa unique and why he best represents Iowa values:  I think that in spite of all the stuff we see, all the smoke, all the nonsense, the things that we shake our head on a daily basis, you know, underneath all that, in a place like Iowa, you know, you do have the bedrock values that make this country unique. I mean, those are still alive and well in a state like Iowa. And I think they're alive and well throughout most of the United States. It's just that's not always what people are seeing, and those values, unfortunately, haven't been the values that have been powering a lot of the policy at the national level, and even some of these other states other than Florida and Iowa. My candidacy really represents an opportunity to take all the things that are great about a state like Iowa and those values and make sure that we have a resurgence of that nationwide. Because when we're true to the principles that make America great, we do very well as a country. When we divert from those principles, which we've been doing lately, that's where we run into some turbulence. And so we need a new birth of freedom, and we need a revival of the American spirit. And I do think that starts right here in Iowa.  State of the Union with Jake Tapper, CNN  Watch the full interview HERE. On the momentum in Iowa:  Our voters are very motivated. We have spent a lot of time in Iowa because we've gone door-to-door, getting people to commit to caucus to us and we have a huge number of people that have committed to caucus, and we expect that these are the people that turn out. So, there is a lot of excitement on the ground. We're in this for the long haul. We understand that you have to win a majority of the delegates, we understand that there is a long process here but we're going to do well here because we've done it right and our folks will turn out. And anyone that tells you that they could model exactly who is going to turn out in the broader electorate, it is unknowable. But with our folks, they're committed and will be there and we'll have a good night.  On braving the elements heading into the Iowa Caucus:  Iowa is doing a great job of clearing the roads. We've been doing events, we did events all day yesterday, we were traveling around, obviously we want people to be safe. But we will be there to help people if they need. We've already arranged rides for a lot of folks. This is just something that's important. People want to be a part of this process. And what I've said is, you're probably never going to have an opportunity to have your vote count more and pack more of a punch than in this Iowa caucus. Last time in 2016, I think there were 186,000 people that participated, a lot of people thought even before the weather, there may be less this time. Now with the weather, it could be it could be significantly less. So we're telling our supporters you go out you bring some friends and family that is going to pack a big punch, of course, you know, be safe while you're doing it. But we have had events we've had a lot of people coming to these events. And I think people are motivated they want to participate in this process. It's kind of been a long time coming and now they can finally actually render the judgment. And it's not just going to be about what some of the pundits and whatnot think.  This Week with Jonathan Karl, ABC  Watch the full interview HERE. On why we need a President DeSantis in the White House:  Donald Trump's running for his issues. I'm running for your issues and your family's issues and solely to turn this country around. I've delivered on 100% of my promises. Donald Trump obviously didn't build the wall, didn't drain the swamp, and didn't reduce the debt. I've also taken on and beaten the Democrats and the left. And in reality, Donald Trump, as President, oftentimes got beat by the Democrats -- at the border, he got beat on debt. And so we have an opportunity to have a two-term president, someone that's going to be able to win decisively, and then actually bring all this stuff into fruition, and I'm the guy to do it.  On what leadership is to Ron DeSantis:  For me, leadership is not about yourself. It's not about showmanship or any of that. It's about producing results. So when you make promises, do you deliver? And if you break the promises, then that's not good leadership. So he was, he ran in 2016, you covered that campaign. He said he was going to build the wall and have Mexico pay for it, drain the swamp, hold Hillary accountable, eliminate the debt -- none of that stuff came to fruition. And so the way I view it is simply, I make promises to people and I am fully intent on following through with it. And I'm going to be willing to sacrifice whatever's in my own personal political interest to be able to deliver on those big promises. And so he didn't deliver on those key promises the first time. So the question is, even if he could get elected, you know, he's close to 80 years old, he'd be a lame duck president, he's got a lot of issues surrounding him personally that he's very concerned about, is he going to be able to deliver on all those things? And so for me, it's just the end of the day, it's about results. You got to deliver on what you promised.  On why Ron DeSantis is the best path forward for the country:  One of the reasons I'm running, John, is because after the midterms of 2022, we saw very clearly the pathway forward for the party was like what we did in Florida, what Governor Reynolds, who's endorsed me here in Iowa, what she did winning big. Governors and Republicans that had their own brand and focused on results performed extraordinarily well. The other Republicans who were more aligned with Trump and his issues, they underperformed. That's just the reality. So my fear is doing 2024 with a rematch would have a lot of the same dynamics that we had in 2020, only Donald Trump won't be an incumbent. I mean, the advantages of incumbency are incredible. And yet, we are where we are. So I think I have the best path forward for the party to both unite the party because you got to have somebody that can energize the base and I think that Trump obviously has done that in the past, I've done that in Florida and can do it nationally. Haley cannot do that. I mean, she is not getting support from conservatives. She's relying on Democrat-leaning independents for her support in the primary. That's just not the way you can win and galvanize support from the party faithful.  KCCI 8 News Close Up  Watch the full interview HERE. On his support from Christians across the state:  They do turn out. I mean, I think that's the great thing. You know, somebody like Bob Vander Plaats, they have a big network of pastors. These are folks that turn out, the people in their congregations turn out. I'm not trying to be a, contort myself into some pretzel to try to assuage voting groups. You know, I'm somebody that relies on faith in God, being a husband, being a father, and being a leader for this country that understands a president -- a governor, a president, anyone -- you're a servant of the people. You're not a ruler over the people. God is the Ruler over the people. I'm here to serve, and I'm here to stand for the truth.  On all his winning ingredients in Iowa:  Cruz had a really good organization, people said it was the best that they'd seen. Now, Governor Reynolds, you know, of course, who has endorsed me, Bob Vander Plaats, they said, what we've done is better than what Cruz had in '16. Santorum, of course, went to all 99 counties, he'd show up. You know, we've shown up, and we've done that. Huckabee had a lot of grassroots energy, and we have that too.

He speaks their language.""  Read the endorsement below. DeSantis represents GOP's best choice in Iowa caucuses  Editorial Board Sioux City Journal Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis represents the Republicans' best shot at regaining the White House. We say this after a presidential campaign that has made Iowa like a second home for GOP presidential candidates. Try to name those who were in the mix early on and you'll see how long the race has been. Through it all, DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley have made the most compelling cases to choose someone other than former president Donald Trump for the job. We realize the former president has a big following, including in Northwest Iowa, but there's too much baggage, too many uncertainties to consider a second Trump term. Haley, who as a former United Nations ambassador was part of that White House, told us about his cavalier ways of making decisions. Even though campaign ads tout his desire to ""build a wall,"" Trump had the opportunity and didn't finish the job. He also has countless legal problems, which are major distractions. As challengers like to point out, we don't need more chaos in government. A second Trump era would ensure it. That leaves Ohio businessmen Vivek Ramaswamy, The Rev. Ryan Binkley, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, DeSantis and Haley, all who have met with members of our editorial board. While Hutchinson and Binkley have been good warriors in the fight, they don't have the support to make a dent in the big three. Ramaswamy doesn't either, but he's a tireless campaigner, suggesting a run for Congress might be a better future path to the White House. That leaves DeSantis and Haley as the two candidates most likely to win. Haley is more moderate; DeSantis supports many of the same policies as Trump. Haley likely would be a good choice to court Democrats or independent voters. DeSantis is a better choice to corral former Trump voters willing to leave the fold. But this is the Republican caucus, not the general election. From that vantage point, we believe DeSantis is most in line with Iowa Republicans. He has the endorsement of Gov. Kim Reynolds and shares her views about education, abortion and border security. Haley has softer stands on those issues – ones that likely would play better with Democrats. If she faced Joe Biden in the fall, she would give them a reason to think twice about a second term. DeSantis plays the Republican cards. He was practically embedded in Iowa (pulling off the full-Grassley, as did Ramaswamy and Binkley) and heard those Republicans and their concerns. He appeals to disillusioned Trump supporters and gives them answers they seek. There are questions whether DeSantis will pull in a large enough swath of independents or play well in other early nominating states after Iowa. Who wins the caucuses? Undefined on the polls, the smart money is still on Trump dominating Monday night. But political tea leaves suggest DeSantis could pull a surprise. His campaign touts a strong ground game that could get committed voters to precinct sites, which could prove invaluable with double-digit wind chills forecast Monday night. If Iowans want to send a message to fellow Republicans across the country, they need to get behind Ron DeSantis. He speaks their language. ... The Journal editorial board endorses Ron DeSantis in his bid for the presidency.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/369816",3918,"DES MOINES, Iowa – Today's blizzard didn't stop Nikki Haley from going out and earning every Iowans vote. Instead of in-person town halls, Haley hosted three telephone town halls with voters across the Hawkeye State and sat down with Fox News' Sean Hannity to discuss Joe Biden's absence on the world stage. Haley on Hannity: Joe Biden Doesn't Even Know Where He Is  On Joe Biden's absence...  ""People are worried. They see those wars and they're worried about what this means. We should always be focused on national security and prevention of war. That's what Joe Biden's missed. The reason all this has happened is because he's been too slow and too weak on everything. We saw it from Afghanistan, we saw it in the fact that Putin surrounded Ukraine a whole year before and he did nothing. We see it now with Iran. They smell blood in the water. And so what they're doing is they're taking advantage of every situation because they know Joe isn't. And what bothers me even more than that, I've told people what keeps me up at night is what happens between now and election day. Because you just showed that clip of Joe Biden. It didn't even feel like he knew where he was."" On why America should care about Ukraine... ""We should never give cash to any country, friend or foe, because you can't follow it. You can't hold it accountable. You know, take these one at a time. You look at Ukraine. Here's a pro-American, freedom-loving country who was invaded by a thug. Half a million people have died and been wounded because of Putin. But why should America care about Ukraine? That's a legitimate question to ask. The problem is Biden and no one else is telling the American people the truth. We know, and I saw this every day at the UN, dictators, thugs and terrorists tell us exactly what they're going to do. They're amazingly transparent. Hamas said they were going to go into Israel. They did. China said they were going to take Hong Kong. We watched it. Russia said they were going to invade Ukraine. It happened. China says Taiwan is next. We better believe them. Russia said once they take Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics are next. Those are NATO countries. That puts America at war. This is about preventing war. It's always been about preventing war."" Telephone Town Hall #1, #2, and #3  Washington Post's Dylan Wells: ""I know that on Jan. 15th, it is going to be -19°. I know it is asking a lot of you to go out and caucus, but I also know we have a country to save, and I will be out there in the cold. And I know Iowans take this in a very serious way,"" Haley told callers at her virtual event.

With just three days until the Iowa caucuses, voters across the Hawkeye State are rallying to Nikki Haley's message of leaving behind the drama and chaos of the past and electing a new generational, conservative leader. See for yourself.   SUE SMITH: ""I think I probably really like a lot of Iowans, just started paying attention within the last two or three weeks but I really like what I see with Nikki Haley. I think she's obviously, her credentials are strong as a former governor and a former ambassador to the UN. I like how she can grasp the complexity of our national and international situation right now. And I think she would restore dignity and class to the White House. Her character is strong. She's someone that I would want my children to emulate. And I think she just serves as a balm, sort of to heal America's soul right now, which is something we desperately need. And I agree with your previous guest, I guess, who was talking about electability. I think she is electable regardless of whomever the Democrats choose to run."" DAN LIENEMANN: ""It is between President Trump and Governor Haley. Really boils down to a known commodity with President Trump. I know what we're going to get as far as policies. And I like that, although I don't like the chaos that surrounds it. It's a little bit of a circus, both from his opponents and some of his own self-inflicted wounds. But then you have Governor Haley on the other side, and she says that she likes a lot of the policies that Trump enacted. And I am assuming that she'll follow through with that but I do think there's, as Sue said, an opportunity to have a better consensus in working maybe with the other side of the aisle with Governor Haley so it's kind of a decision between what is known and what is unknown a little bit between the two.""","","",""

In a new Rasmussen Reports survey released today, Haley is the only major candidate who loses to Joe Biden in a general election. Read the Washington Examiner's full story on the poll below. Trump and DeSantis would beat Biden, not Nikki Haley Washington Examiner  Paul Bedard  January 11th, 2024 Voters are pouring cold water on reports that Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley would beat President Joe Biden in a head-to-head election. While she is the media darling of the hour, a new Rasmussen Reports survey shared with Secrets on Thursday showed that of the top three Republican presidential candidates, only she would lose to Biden. In that matchup, Biden leads 38%-36%. By comparison, former President Donald Trump holds a commanding 49%-41% lead, and Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) is edging Biden 42%-41%. The survey is the latest to show that Trump is crushing Biden and that he is close to getting a majority of all voters to back him. Rasmussen's survey is of the general election, not the upcoming primaries and caucuses. But it gives an indication of how voters on all sides view Haley's chances in the fall election. What is notable is how Republicans view the three versus Biden. When it's Trump versus Biden, 79% of Republicans would choose the former president. When it is DeSantis, 68% of Republican voters would pick the governor. But when Republicans were asked who they would pick between Haley and Biden, just 55% chose the former United Nations ambassador. A sizable 24% want ""some other candidate."" ...","","",""

We see it in the violence on our city streets. We see it in the hatred on college campuses. We feel it in our economy, with all the inflation and the trillions of dollars in national debt. And we feel it around the world. There's war in Ukraine and Israel. China, Russia and Iran are exploiting our weakness. America is less safe today than at any point in my lifetime. All this has happened under Joe Biden's watch. He's the author of this chaos. We have to stop it — before it's too late. But you can't defeat Democrat chaos with Republican crisis. That's what Donald Trump gives us. It worked, for a time. In 2016, we needed a president who broke things. But eight years later, everything is still broken, and it won't be long before it's beyond repair. In 2024, we need a president who fixes things. Or else America may fall apart. I will be that president. My approach is simple. No drama. No vendettas. No whining. No fanning the flames of anger and resentment. No turning Americans against each other. People are hungry for this new direction. It's why I crush Joe Biden in every poll. Here's the America I envision. We're safe at home and secure abroad, protected by the world's strongest military — a military, I might add, in which my husband, Michael, is serving overseas right now. Our goal should always be to use our strength to prevent further wars. We finally protect ourselves from illegal immigration and Chinese infiltration. We unleash our economy, ending inflation and the slow creep of socialism. We restore our freedom — our secret weapon — and empower the American people to usher in a new era of innovation and shared prosperity. And we transform education with parental choice and control, so every child gets the best shot at the best life. Most importantly, in the America I envision, we rediscover our national purpose and pride. Take it from me, the first minority female governor in history: America is not a racist country. America is a blessed country — the best country the world has ever seen. That's what my parents taught me and my siblings. I saw the promise of America unfold before me. And to this day, I'm determined to continue making that promise real for all. The next president of the United States will oversee the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. When that day arrives, we can't afford to be a country in chaos, full of weakness, self-loathing, and division. We need a country that's strong, proud, and united — so America doesn't just survive, but thrives for the next 250 years.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/369234",3993,"WMUR by Arielle Mitropoulos After New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu announced his emphatic endorsement of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley last month, his father and his brother are now following suit, both declaring their support, as she looks to move in on former President Donald Trump's lead in New Hampshire. ""I am honored to have the support of America's coolest political family,"" Haley said in a statement obtained first by WMUR. ""The Sununu's are strong leaders who have served America and New Hampshire with honor and integrity. I'm excited to have them on the team and look forward to making history in the Live Free or Die State."" Former Gov. John H. Sununu, who held office between 1983 and 1989, said that it is now time for a new generation of leadership. ""Nikki Haley is America's best bet to rid ourselves of the 80-year-old wanderer in the White House, as a matter of fact, ridding us of any 80-year-old who might make it to the White House,"" said former Governor John H. Sununu. His other son, former Sen. John E. Sununu agreed, adding that ""[Haley will] tackle the problems Trump failed to fix. She'll stop the outrageous spending, fix the border and immigration, and move America forward, past the chaos."" The Sununu family has been public and vocal in their criticism of former President Trump. During the 2016 election, Gov. John H. Sununu told ABC News that Trump has been ""a loser all his life,"" though he would ultimately go on to patch-up his feud and endorse him. Prior to and following his decision not to run for the presidency, Gov. Chris Sununu has offered similar condemnation of Trump. ""Donald Trump's the past. He's trying to re-litigate 2020 and talk about Jan. 6 and all that sort of thing,"" Gov. Chris Sununu told WMUR in an interview in June. ""That Donald Trump message killed us in '18, really hurt us in '20."" Following a similar political playbook to his father, ahead of the Iowa caucuses, last week, Gov. Chris Sununu traveled to Iowa with Haley to lobby voters. In 1988, Gov. John H. Sununu traveled to Iowa in support of George H.W. Bush when he was running for president. At the time, Bush placed third in the Iowa caucuses, but by the next day, he had already shifted his focus to New Hampshire. ""I lost – now, I want to win,"" Bush said, with Sununu by his side, and with the Governor's support, Bush would go on to win the New Hampshire primary. Although Bush would ultimately bring Gov. John H. Sununu to the White House with him, as his first Chief of Staff, Gov. Chris Sununu has dismissed questions about whether he would be open to a role in a Haley administration, and Haley told reporters in December that Sununu has informed her that he has told her ""he doesn't want anything to do with D.C."" Although polling shows Trump holds a commanding lead in Iowa, the support Haley is receiving from the Sununu family comes as other polling shows her experiencing a swell of support in New Hampshire. In a recent CNN poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire, Haley has slashed Trump's lead to single digits among likely primary Republican voters in New Hampshire, with the former President standing at 39%, compared to Haley's 32%, a just 7%, difference, compared to a 22% difference in mid-November. However, other polls suggest that Trump's support remains strong and far higher than his competitors. A Suffolk University, The Boston Globe, and USA Today poll, released Tuesday, found that Trump still leads with likely primary voters by nearly 20% in New Hampshire. Sununu told WMUR's sister station in Iowa, KCCI, last week, that he is hopeful that Haley will finish a strong second in the Hawkeye State before bringing her momentum to New Hampshire, like Bush did in 1988. ""We don't want to set any unrealistic expectations. I think she can do it. I think it's possible. Who knows what's actually going to happen here? It's the Iowa Caucus. That's the amazing part about it. It's all about who comes out to vote,"" Sununu said.","","",""

And I think this is why. We've been able to build a solid following.""  DES MOINES, Iowa – Ron DeSantis tonight joined Laura Ingraham live on Fox News Channel's The Ingraham Angle. The highlights are below. Watch the full interview HERE. On his closing argument to Iowans ahead of the Iowa Caucuses:  Our pitch is simple. Donald Trump's running for his issues. Nikki Haley's running for her donors' issues. I'm running for your issues and your family's issues. As somebody that's delivered on 100% of my promises as governor of Florida, and as the only candidate running that has taken on the left and beaten the left on issue after issue, we beat the teacher's unions, we beat Fauci, we beat George Soros on crime, we beat the Democrats on election integrity and on illegal immigration, and we beat the left by banning China from buying land in the state of Florida. So we have the ability to produce big results. And I think, you talked about this weather, our approach to Iowa was that a caucus is different than a primary or typical election. And so you have to really build an organization that's going to be able to turn out your commitments on caucus night, which may not be the best environment. And now, we did not expect it to be negative 22 when we did it, but I do feel that we're in a situation where our folks are going to show up. We've got every precinct organized, every county organized, and that's going to pay dividends. And it was a lot of hard work. The media was saying that I was wasting my time, they were saying that why are you going to all 99 counties? And I think this is why. We've been able to build a solid following.  On his plans in New Hampshire and South Carolina next week:  Some media was saying we weren't doing New Hampshire at all. That's not true. We're going to do an event in Greenville on Tuesday morning, and then we're going to fly to New Hampshire and do a town hall on CNN later that night -- and do a lot of stuff in New Hampshire. But I think the message is simple that, you know, you look at South Carolina, Nikki Haley was governor there, and I've got like five times more endorsements from state legislators current and former than she does. And that would be unthinkable for the opposite to happen in a place like Florida. And so she's really out of step, I think, with South Carolina. We're going to show that with the support we have. And people have been focusing on Iowa, but we've been building these organizations in New Hampshire and in South Carolina as well. Didn't get as much fanfare, but that's the case. So yes, we'll start in South Carolina, do New Hampshire. We have a debate scheduled on Thursday in New Hampshire, WMUR debate. I'm the only one that's accepted that debate. I hope that debate happens. But if not, I'll be there. If they want to do a town hall, I'm game.  On how he'll combat the border crisis:  When I'm president that'll be dead on arrival. You know, some of these Republicans are just so out of touch with the voters. I've gone to all 99 counties in Iowa. It's not a border state, and yet every single town hall I do, I get multiple questions about illegal immigration and about the border. Republicans want people that are here illegally to be deported, which we need to do. They want to end these insane border policies that Biden's doing. Yes, they want a wall, they want to see that done. And they also want to see action against the drug cartels. And I think what you're likely to see out of this deal is the typical Lucy with the football: promising you're going to deal with the border, and then of course, the football gets pulled away. And it's the same old song and dance. At the end of the day, there are some Republicans -- and I would say Nikki Haley is one of them -- you know, they want the open borders because the donors want it for the cheap labor. We got to start putting the American people first and stop worrying about, you know, these guys that don't care about our sovereignty. We're gonna lose this country if you keep allowing millions and millions of people to come in at this rate.","","",""

A real leader tells the American people the truth, but Trump is lying to the American people about Social Security in his latest attack ad. Under Trump's do-nothing plan, Social Security will start running out of money in 2033 and will require a 23% cut in benefits to keep it afloat. Nikki Haley has always spoken hard truths. She has a plan to save Social Security and Medicare without taking away anything from people nearing or in retirement. ""All of Donald Trump's attack ads prove that he is terrified of Nikki Haley's rise,"" said Haley communications director Nachama Soloveichik. ""This is a two-person race between Nikki's conservative vision for a strong and proud America and Trump's continued obsession with the chaos and drama of the past."" DONALD TRUMP Trump now says he wants to do nothing to save Social Security and Medicare even though he has previously acknowledged the programs' looming fiscal crisis. In a January 2023 video message to Republicans, Trump said, ""Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from Medicare or Social Security."" In his 2000 book, The America We Deserve, Trump wrote, ""If you're a young person, you would definitely do better to believe in the X-Files than to count on getting your full Social Security benefit."" Trump called Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme,"" and suggested solutions ranging from privatizing Social Security to raising ""the age for receipt of full Social Security to 70."" He defends raising the retirement age: ""A firm limit at age 70 makes sense now for people under 40. We're living longer. We're working longer. New medicines are extending healthy human life.""  In 2020, Trump proposed cutting Medicare to deal with the growing debt crisis (that he helped create). NIKKI HALEY Haley is the only Republican candidate willing to address the financial crisis facing Social Security.  CNN: Haley questions GOP frontrunners over Social Security and Medicare promises.  Haley has put forth a plan for reforming Social Security and Medicare that does NOT take away from people nearing or in retirement: Raise the retirement age for younger generations and index Social Security and Medicare benefits to life expectancy.  Limit the growth of benefits for higher-income beneficiaries. Expand Medicare Advantage and increase competition. Match cost-of-living increases for Social Security to actual inflation rates by using chained CPI. Praise for Haley's honest talk about Social Security and Medicare: Wall Street Journal editorial board: ""Few politicians are willing to touch entitlements these days, but Nikki Haley dared to do so in the recent debate on Medicare. A new study shows her pitch to expand the Medicare Advantage program could lower costs and improve care."" Tiana Lowe Doescher, Washington Examiner: ""Nikki Haley is correct: Refusing to touch Social Security means a 23% benefit cut"" S.E. Cupp, CNN: ""She gave some tough talk to her own party on entitlement reform for example.... I thought all of that was pretty refreshing."" Kelly Sadler, NewsMax: ""So far Nikki Haley has been the only one who has addressed it on the campaign trail, saying that she would like 20-year-olds who are not bought into the program yet to be paying a little bit more or trying to alter the program so it is solvent for the 20-year-olds who are just entering the workplace.""","","",""

Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Of the five veteran politics watchers surveyed by The Post, four said Haley was the clear winner. Republican consultant Bill O'Riley said Haley, 51, had ""a great night"" at Drake University in Des Moines, continuing her run of ""consistently crisp"" debate performances. ""She was sharp, informed, and compelling throughout the night,"" he added. ""Her use of 'DeSantisLies.com' was a smart rhetorical tactic by her campaign. Few will actually go to the website, but viewers heard that message over and over again. She drove it home."" As for DeSantis, 45, O'Riley said the Sunshine State leader ""hit his marks, but he lacks the confidence that Haley exudes. This debate won't hurt DeSantis, but it did nothing to put momentum on his side."" The consultant also took issue with DeSantis' use of the phrase ""pale pastels"" to describe Haley's ideas, a callback to Ronald Reagan's 1976 Republican National Convention speech. ""It was downright bizarre,"" O'Riley said. ""It may have sounded great in prep sessions, but it came across as weird on Wednesday night. It will be interesting to see if DeSantis stays in the race past Iowa."" Another Republican consultant, Rob Ryan, said DeSantis ""started off too hot"" by saying in his opening statement that Haley was running ""to pursue her donors' issues."" ""His failure to display some level of humor or charm when going on the attack and his repeatedly calling Haley a liar will remind many women of their ex-husband,"" Ryan predicted. ""Haley came off strong and informed. She stood her ground and pushed back on DeSantis' attacks. She was smart to focus more on her accomplishments."" O'Brien Murray, who has consulted Republicans and conservative Democrats, told The Post that if the debate had been a boxing match, it would have been over early. ""Lucky the bell (the moderators) kept saving DeSantis,"" he said, adding that Haley ""is ready for a general election, she can win, and DeSantis showing up only confirmed she is ready for prime time, and he's ready to go back to Florida."" DeSantis ""smiles when he can attack, otherwise his face looks like he is about to get hit by a bus,"" Murray added. ""A deer in headlights looks more confident."" Watching from the Democratic camp, longtime party consultant Hank Sheinkopf said Haley was a ""bulldozer."" ""She tried to paint DeSantis as a liar — and it worked. DeSantis looked lost,"" he said. With former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie withdrawing from the race earlier Wednesday, Sheinkopf said, ""Haley comes out of the debate with momentum. She comes across as the anti-Trump candidate in the race while DeSantis was trying to have it both ways."" The Democrat did give DeSantis props for his statements on education during the debate, when he bragged about expanding school choice in Florida and all but crippling Miami's major teacher union. However, Sheinkopf said, Haley bounced back even stronger with her statement on entitlements. ""Haley was more honest on Social Security,"" he said of her comment that workers currently in their 20s would likely see their full retirement age raised. ""She told the truth."" The one caveat to our experts' verdict was the absence of former President Donald Trump, who opted to do a town hall with Fox News rather than face his two nearest rivals and CNN moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. ""Haley looked confident and sounded like a leader, but this is all the Twilight Zone,"" said Democratic consultant Chris Coffey. ""She can't bring herself to go after Trump, who is leading in every poll. It's like a battle to come in second after the game has been decided. ""They both kept calling each other liars,"" Coffey added, ""but it felt like they were lying to themselves about whether they have any chance of winning. Trump is the big winner tonight. The American people are the losers."" Ryan agreed, comparing the CNN showdown to ""a battle for who wins the bronze and silver medals in the Olympics. ""We'll know the winner when we see who got more viewers, CNN or Fox.""","","",""

It's easier for us to put a website up and go and show that the fact checkers have all said that he's lying on dozens of things. So we put it on a website so we could deal with it. But what I can tell you now is our goal is to be strong in Iowa. We're going to move it to a two-person race when we get to New Hampshire. We're going to get stronger when it's in South Carolina. And we're going to finish it."" On her home state advantage in South Carolina... ""South Carolinians are very smart. They don't throw their vote away. So they want to see you fight for it. They want to see you work for it. And so I think they're watching what we do in Iowa. They're going to watch what we do in New Hampshire. And then they're going to wait until they see what's given to them in South Carolina. That's when you'll see things shift. Our approval numbers are very good in South Carolina because they know I fought for them. They know we fought to pass the toughest illegal immigration law in the country. They know we passed tort reform, that we passed voter I.D., that we, you know, turn South Carolina into the beast of the Southeast by bringing 11% unemployment down to 4%. So they're very proud of the work that we did and so we're gonna bring it back to South Carolina and we're gonna bring it back with momentum.""","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370650",8078,"DES MOINES, Iowa – Ron DeSantis this morning joined MSNBC's Morning Joe, NewsRadio 1040 WHO's Max & Amy in the Morning, and AM 600 WMT's Doug Wagner Show. The highlights are below. MSNBC: Morning Joe  Watch the full interview HERE. On how he stood up to Fauci and kept Florida free:  This is the number one crisis he faced this president, and he chose to defer to Anthony Fauci. They were running commercials in October of 2020 for his reelection bragging that he followed everything Fauci said. And then when Fauci, Donald Trump's last day in office, he gave Fauci a commendation. He forcibly shut down Florida's cruise industry, they shut down churches on military bases, and they were pressuring states. Remember, when Brian Kemp reopened Georgia in April, Donald Trump went to the White House podium and attacked him for doing that. He was saying schools should be closed. They attacked me in the summer of 2020, when Florida had its first COVID wave and we had schools and businesses open. So it's massive, massive gaslighting. He was able to do that, I guess, on Fox with no pushback, which was really -- well, I guess that's just par for the course at this point. But the reality is, he knows that he dropped the ball on that.  On Chris Christie's hot mic moment:  I served in Fallujah and Ramadi, so nothing about the political stuff, you know, would, quote, petrify me. So, I don't know where he got that. I did call him just to offer him encouragement because I think that he had been treated poorly with so many people just demanding that he get out of the race. I didn't think he was going to get out based on my conversation, but it's all good. But I do think it's not going to be a big factor in Iowa because he really wasn't competing here. So in that sense, you know, we're all systems go through Monday. And I think that's our sole focus.  On answering tough questions and defending his record: I did a town hall with them the day before. And I had about, I think, a half a dozen left wing plants -- including people that rushed the stage when I was up there. Which is fine, I mean, we roll with the punches. But yeah, I don't think that there was very many critical questions. And incidentally, we had a debate in Iowa at the same time. He was invited, he could have come. He's not done any debates yet. I think it's because he knows he can get away with that type of gaslighting in that venue. He knows he wouldn't be able to get away with that if we were just on the debate stage. And here's the thing. He was bragging in 2020 that he shut down the greatest economy in the world. He used to say he saved millions of lives to do that. Now he knows Republican voters think that was a mistake, but he cannot admit that he made a mistake. And I think as a leader, you know, if something doesn't work, you course correct. And voters appreciate, it's refreshing when you acknowledge that you got something wrong. Donald Trump just can't do that.  NewsRadio 1040 WHO: Max & Amy in the Morning  Listen to the full interview HERE. On winning the CNN debate:  I think most people said it was our best yet. I know there was the one scientific poll we won overwhelmingly. But you know, the reality is I think two things. I mean, I think that, you know, we showed a contrast, you know, with Nikki Haley in terms of she's really represented and being funded by you know, kind of a lot of the warmed over corporatist faction of the Republican Party. And those are folks that honestly have not delivered very much for the American people over many decades. That's not where Iowa Republicans are. And that's not how I've governed as governor of Florida. You know, we've really focused on Main Street issues, you know, we've taken on woke corporations, you know, like Disney, and that came up where Nikki Haley sided with Disney, I sided with parents and kids about not having sexualization in the curriculum. You also had differences in terms of, you know, what's America's role in the world? I think that we want a strong America to deter conflict. She really wants to get us more involved around the rest of the world. But I think a lot of voters realize that that's not ultimately going to be the ticket to success. So I pointed out, you know, she had been ambassador to the UN, you know, that you may be able to take the ambassador out of the UN, but you can't take the UN out of the ambassador. And I think that that's true. And then I think the other issue is okay, you know, it getting down to a two person race, for people that realize or believe, hey, you know, we need to move on from Donald Trump, we need to focus on the future more, which one of us on that stage would be able to go toe to toe with Donald Trump? I mean, I think she got very flustered. I don't think she was able to defend her record. Whereas I think me, I'm proud of what we've done in Florida. I mean, you know, we've done similar to what Governor Reynolds has done in Iowa, and that's why we've been very successful. So Donald Trump was not willing to go on the stage last night. He counter programmed an event in Iowa on Fox News, where he was basically just given a bunch of softball questions. And so, you know, I think Iowans do expect you to kind of go through this process. I think that people need to subject themselves, you know, to tough environment where people are going to be firing at you. I mean, if you can't do that now, how are you going to be able to handle a general election where you're going to have the entire media hitting that you, the Democratic party, all this stuff? You need somebody that's going to be strong and is going to be able to carry the banner for the party in a good way. AM 600 WMT: The Doug Wagner Show  Listen to the full interview HERE. On his support in Iowa:  I mean, I think our events in the last week, a lot of undecideds are coming. We're going to be barnstorming Iowa all through caucus. I think there's a lot of people that haven't made a firm decision. We've got a lot of firm commitments, which is great. And these folks are going to come out, and we're going to turn them out. But we have, others have decisions to make. And the way I frame it is this: Donald Trump is running for his issues, Nikki Haley's running for her donors' issues, I'm running for your issues and your family's issues and solely to turn this country around. I'm the only candidate running that's delivered on 100% of his promises as governor down in Florida. And then the only candidate running that's beat the left across the board, whether it's the teachers' unions on school choice, whether it's Fauci on COVID, whether it's George Soros on crime, whether it's the left by us banning China from buying land in the state of Florida. We've just not, we've not only fought for people, we've won for people, and that's what we need for the next leader of this country.  On combatting false media narratives:  This is a unique caucus because, you know, you have a former president who is running, not participating in the normal give and take of debates or whatnot, has a lot of favorable media, the liberal media, I think, wants him to be the nominee, then he's got the conservative media that better protecting him. And so they've created a narrative around this. And I think once Iowans vote, you know, it's like, okay, well, this is where we're at. So I think doing well here really, really will be more meaningful probably than in past years with caucus. And so what I've been telling people is, you're probably never going to be able to cast a more meaningful vote in your life. I mean, there's going to be a relatively small number of people. 186,000 caucused in 2016. It could be less, I mean, you could have 150,000 show up. So if you're going, and you're supporting me, and you bring a neighbor, and a friend, and a family member, that is going to have a huge impact if Iowans are doing that all up and down the state. So yes, I think it's going to be a big deal. I think it's going to bring further clarity to the race, and that's what this is all about.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370634",6507,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Ron DeSantis dominated Nikki Haley in last night's debate in Des Moines. Here's what they are saying about DeSantis' ""best performance yet"": Campaign Manager James Uthmeier on CNN : Listen, ultimately, people know Nikki Haley is not a conservative, and the Republican Party right now is not going to nominate somebody who is not a conservative when it comes to conservative bona fides. Ron DeSantis has those. He's the only candidate that can unite both the people that want to move on from Trump that want to see a better tomorrow that don't want to be looking at the past, as well as many people that are still open to Trump that are frustrated by the weaponized government, and that like things better the way they were before Ron DeSantis can do both. He's got a record of conservative achievements. The people have, I would know that they will go out they will vote to support that and then we'll move on to the subsequent states. And listen, it's a long journey. It's not just one or even two states that decide this outcome. We have a long ways to go. Deputy Campaign Manager David Polyansky on ABC:  First, thank you for having me. And yes, it was a dominating performance by Governor DeSantis. And really a very tough night for Nikki Haley, in terms of painting a very sharp contrast between their records. It was a no - it was they needed to stop the fight early. When you talk about the governor's Governor DeSantis' record in Florida, for instance, where he's got the number one economy in the country. He has the number one school system in the country, number one in education, where he has kept China out of the state in terms of both land sales, and even institutes and universities. All of that paints a record of a very clear accomplishments that the party is looking for in its next nominee and somebody that can take on Joe Biden. And that's in sharp contrast to Nikki Haley, who stood up there tonight, and struggled to defend a record with - where South Carolina during her tenure had the worst state education system in the country or her economy was not nearly meeting expectations, and where she handed out China land sales not just near military bases, but by putting them in their college institutions. It was a very sharp contrast. But what really was exciting was the sharp contrast painted between their visions for the future. And right now Governor DeSantis painted his vision, and Nikki Haley struggled to define what hers was. Senator Amy Sinclair on WHO13 News: Yeah, so I have supported Governor DeSantis. The entire time I've I I'm not shy about that. I supported the governor because he has accomplished all of the things he promised to do. And he followed through with him, he turned to purple state deep red. And I think he can do those things for the nation. I agree with him philosophically. And I back him on all of those things. What I watched was a very, very confident Governor DeSantis get up there and tout what he's done and why he's done it and how he'll do it for that poor nation. And I saw very, very agitated Nikki Haley, get upset, every time record was called into question. Bob Vander Plaats on KCCI:  I think one is you see a guy that can win. Governor DeSantis has a great record in the state of Florida. And a lot of ways it mirrors what Governor Reynolds has done here in the state of Iowa. They resonate with it so much. But not only that, he took a toss up state like Florida, and he won a landslide in the midterm election in 2022. I think what you saw tonight as you saw tonight is a leader who's very comfortable in his own skin and who has delivered on a lot of conservative policies, whether it be parental rights, school choice, taking on Fauci and COVID or taking on the woke agenda in the schools or in corporate America. I think a lot of the people tonight are saying there's a clear difference here. Bob Vander Plaats on CNN: Iowa will do a job well, Dana, if we present an alternative to the former president, and then what you do is you give America a choice, either the former president in Donald Trump, or a clear alternative, which I believe is going to be Ron DeSantis. So they first need to make the case about who can be that alternative. I do think Governor DeSantis did do a good job of where he does have differences with the former president, and why he believes he's best positioned to win not only the primary, but to win the general election as well. Daily Mail: Ron DeSantis declared the WINNER over Nikki Haley in Daily Mail's snap poll of the most crucial debate yet: Iowa voters say Florida governor dominated his rival with four days until the caucuses Iowa Voter: DeSantis is my number one. Dana Loesch: Not even a question: DeSantis won this debate. Solid, unfazed performance full of receipts and he never let Haley off the hook. Haley gets rattled easy, struggles to defend her record, and has major Hillary energy. Ainsley Earhardt: I love that [DeSantis] said that. He said, 'I'm moving forward. I'm not focusing on all the hoaxes from the past. No retribution, I will move forward.' Iowa Voter : I want to see a DeSantis-style candidate. I have supported DeSantis pretty much from the beginning after seeing how great he was at parent engagement in Florida. Parents were at the table right at the beginning. He followed the science. He engaged the scientists. He didn't just follow the political scientists kind of like what Biden has done he has actually followed evidence and we have seen the fruits of his neighbor. Parents here in New York have felt really excluded from the process. Astroturf groups that claim to speak for us but actually there is no one truly advocating for the children. I would like to see whoever ends up being the candidate do that. I think Trump is probably a better candidate than Biden but, I really wish he would get out of the way so that DeSantis. Doug Stafford: I'm not sure I have seen a candidate lie as easily as Haley does live on stage/camera about her own and others positions. Combine that with her neocon foreign policy and she's a non starter for anyone who ever voted for a liberty or America first candidate.

Nikki Haley isn't only taking a page out of Joe Biden's playbook to hide from the media, she's also preventing her voters from speaking with them as well.

On his organized ground game in Iowa:  A caucus is just different than a typical election because it's about organization, it's about turning your people out. We've built an incredible organization. I've gone to all 99 counties. I've answered questions from Iowans all across the state. That is not necessarily what coastal media likes to see. They think you're spending too much time listening to people. I disagree with that. But it does pay off on caucus night. Now with this weather, I think the organization is going to matter even more because going out in negative 20 degrees, unless you're really committed to voting, that's an easy reason why you wouldn't want to go. So we've got that in place. We're continuing to gather more folks. I've done a number of events today, Sean, people are coming out in big numbers, even in the weather. We're going to do an event right after this. I got a big crowd right now here in the Des Moines area. So people are definitely getting excited about this race. We've seen energy on the ground.

On the record number of blue state refugees who flee to Florida:  The number of people that retire out of FDNY, NYPD, Port Authority -- where do they go? I mean, some of them obviously, stay in the tri-state area, but a lot of them move to Florida. I mean, we've got a massive number of folks retired here who were active on 9/11 and responded to the Twin Towers. So, you know, they're getting New York pension payments, and they're spending it in Florida. And you're right, we have half the budget with much better results. Our state government in Florida is the smallest of employees per capita in the entire country. It just shows you the people in New York are getting taxed for your state government to waste the tax dollars because we're doing better with half the footprint. But I also think what you showed with vocal and Cuomo, there's this movement amongst the left to try to demand a one-party state and to try to weaponize government against conservatives. It's not surprising that you've seen that with that line of thinking I think it's really dangerous.","","",""

She also called out Ron DeSantis for lying about his anti-energy record HALEY: Ron DeSantis just came here and spoke to you. Did he tell you that he authored legislation to ban the Renewable Fuel Standard? Did he tell you that he co-sponsored five different bills to ban the Renewable Fuel Standard? Did he tell you that he called out Trump and told him to stop offshore drilling in federal waters? Did he tell you that he banned fracking, did he tell you that he banned offshore drilling? Because he did.  The Haley campaign also released a video on DeSantis' awkward tap-dancing on ethanol.   ""Ron DeSantis flip-flops like an Olympic gymnast, but falls flat on his face every single time,"" said Haley Iowa spokesman Pat Garrett. ""As a congressman, DeSantis wrote legislation to repeal the Renewable Fuel Standard and called it 'socialism.' Now, he refuses to answer Iowans' questions about where he really stands on important energy policy. Hurry up, he only has four days left to figure it out."" BACKGROUND DeSantis sponsored one piece of legislation and cosponsored five pieces of legislation to repeal the Renewable Fuel Standard. In 2015, DeSantis introduced legislation to repeal the Renewable Fuel Standard. DeSantis cosponsored five pieces of legislation to repeal the Renewable Fuel Standard: HR 259, HR 1461, HR 1001, HR 703, HR 1314.  Ron DeSantis wrote a 2015 op-ed denouncing the ethanol program: ""There is perhaps no better example of this type of venture socialism than the infamous ethanol mandate, aka the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Enacted in 2007, the RFS is a harmful policy that damages car and boat engines, hurts the environment, reduces fuel efficiency and places an upward pressure on gas and food prices.""  DeSantis' call for energy dominance is a farce considering he has long opposed offshore drilling and fracking. As a candidate for governor, he called on the Trump administration to drop plans for drilling in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. He promised to ban fracking and drilling on his gubernatorial campaign website. On his second day in office as governor, DeSantis issued executive orders banning fracking and offshore drilling in Florida. He was praised by the Sierra Club","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370593",6266,"Nikki Haley claims to support school choice, but her record as a state legislator and governor of South Carolina reveals the opposite. Instead of delivering on her campaign promises to help families send their children to the schools of their choice, Haley caved to the teacher's union and poured more money into failing government schools. Because Haley rewarded a failed system instead of providing real choice to parents, South Carolina's education ranking was abysmal – dead last in the nation – at the end of her time as governor.  In 2017, when Haley left office, South Carolina ranked dead last (#50) in the nation on education [US News and World Report]   If Nikki Haley could not get school choice in a conservative state like South Carolina, how can we trust her to do it anywhere?   In fact, South Carolina could have had Statewide Open Enrollment School Choice like Florida does, as far back as 2007, but Nikki Haley got in the way.  In 2007, the SC House passed H 3124 - Open Enrollment and School Choice. Nikki Haley, then a state representative, joined Democrats in voting against School Choice.   After the bill passed in spite of Haley's efforts, Governor Mark Sanford vetoed the bill. State legislators attempted to override the veto, but Haley alongside Democrats voted against the veto override, which ultimately failed.   Here are highlights of H-3124 that Haley stood against:   Defines school district choice programs as including public magnet and charter schools, single-gender programs, extended school year programs, virtual schooling programs, arts programs, and other such options, and provides parents with significant influence in assigning their students to these programs   Requires statewide open enrollment beginning with the 2009-2010 school year, and requires each school district to provide an optional elementary, middle and high school program for students by the 2008-2009 school year    While running for governor in 2010, Haley claimed to support school choice in the primary, then backed away in the general.  Cato Institute, 8/31/2010: Haley has recently put out some concerning and confusing statements on school choice. Haley said approving private? school choice, which would provide tax credits or vouchers to pay private? school tuition, was not a priority. 'That is not my focus; my focus is the school funding formula,' Haley said.   After being elected governor, Haley did little to nothing for school choice and gave noncommittal responses when asked about it, e.g.: ""It's not going to be something that's a fix it in one year. It's a 7 to 10 year approach to where we need to go in South Carolina to bring education to a whole new level and it's going to be inclusive of everybody."" (Haley on WISTV, August 2013)   In 2014, then-Governor Haley earned praise from Democrats and even the head of the South Carolina teachers union for her education ""reforms"" -- which poured taxpayer dollars into failing public schools but did not meaningfully expand school choice or improve student outcomes.   Democrat politicians and the head of the state teachers' union praised Haley's anti-school choice plan:  ""Gov. Nikki Haley's proposal to improve public schools by focusing on poor, rural students — and to start a multi-year effort with a $160 million investment — stunned educators and legislators of both parties, who applaud what they consider her about-face on education.""   ""I'm excited about it. I hope this is going to get a positive discussion going,"" said Kathy Maness, director of the Palmetto State Teachers Association. ""I do think the governor is sincere in the initiatives she laid out.""   ""Absent from Haley's plan was any mention of vouchers or tax credits for private education.""   ""Haley said her plan spends 20 percent more on children who qualify for free- and reduced-price meals as well as 20 percent more on children whose primary language isn't English. Democrats in the Statehouse have long advocated for such a weighting as a way to help the neediest students succeed. ""I welcome the governor to the club,"" said Sen. Brad Hutto, D-Orangeburg. Ordinarily one of Haley's chief critics, Hutto said he invites Haley to take the lead in pushing the idea through the Republican-controlled Legislature."" [AP, 1/11/2014]    School choice advocates criticized Haley's plan:  ""The governor's new plan is consistent with most education improvement plans introduced in South Carolina in recent decades: it ignores the single most effective reform that could be enacted, school choice.""   ""The plan does include a small increase in spending on public charter schools, but the amount is trivial compared to the proposed spending increases for traditional public schools.""   ""In essence, the governor's plan is centered on providing increased resources to our existing public school system. The problem is that pouring more resources into a flawed system does nothing to change or improve the way that system operates."" [The Times and Democrat, 2/7/2014]   Where Nikki Haley failed and caved to special interests, Ron DeSantis fought the teacher unions and delivered unprecedented successes for families and students.  DeSantis enacted universal school choice in Florida, expanding access so that all parents are empowered to choose the best education for their children.   At the same time, Florida under DeSantis' leadership has also made record investments in public education and raising teacher pay.   Florida has ranked #1 in higher education the nation for seven years, while keeping tuition affordable and eliminating DEI bureaucracies in public universities.   DeSantis has a record of fighting the teacher unions and winning. In addition to signing universal school choice, DeSantis stood up to the teacher unions during COVID and got schools open in 2020. He signed legislation to protect students from discriminatory DEI and gender ideology in schools.   DeSantis also signed a paycheck protection law that prevents automatic deduction of teacher union dues. Following the paycheck protection law, the teacher union in Florida's largest school district is now facing decertification and ""extinction"". The Miami-Dade public school district is also the third-largest district in the United States.","","",""

In her second term, Haley introduced a roads plan that would ONLY raise the gas tax if the legislature agreed to cut South Carolina's income tax rate – the highest in the Southeast. Grover Norquist, head of the anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform, supported Haley's proposal. A recent article in Forbes debunked the attack on Haley's record: ""A review of the historical record, however, shows Senator Scott's accusations against Haley incomplete and misleading. Nikki Haley did not propose a standalone gas tax hike during any of her six years in the South Carolina governor's mansion. It was Republican state lawmakers at the time who first proposed and drove the push for a gas tax increase."" Fact checkers have denounced this attack. PolitiFact: Campaign ad from DeSantis PAC says Nikki Haley 'raised taxes.' That's Mostly False. New York Times: This is misleading. As governor, Ms. Haley rebuffed calls to increase South Carolina's gas tax as a stand-alone measure. Washington Post: While the ad targets a major concern for conservative voters, tax increases, it's based on a misleading claim that's been frequently used by GOP campaigns this cycle — that Haley as governor of South Carolina supported a gas-tax hike. Haley opposed a stand-alone gas tax increase as governor. In 2015, she proposed raising the gas tax only if the state reduced income tax rates from 7 percent to 5 percent. The plan, her campaign pointed out on Tuesday, died in the state legislature and gas taxes were not increased during her time in office. The Hill: PolitiFact labeled the gas tax claims ""mostly false."" Haley did advocate for raising the gas tax in 2015, but only alongside a cut in the income tax. Her proposal did not pass. Haley adamantly opposed a standalone gas tax increase during her first term as governor. In 2014, when members of the legislature were pushing to increase the gas tax, Haley shot them down. Despite pressure from the Chamber of Commerce, the Trucking Association, and the legislature, Haley explained that she opposed a gas tax increase because she believes funding for infrastructure can be generated without raising taxes and businesses looking to come to South Carolina pay attention to the state's lower tax. Haley: ""Our gas tax is one of our biggest selling points.""  Haley introduced a roads plan that would ONLY increase the gas tax if it was tied to income tax rate cuts. It was a net tax cut. In January 2015, at the beginning of her second term, Haley introduced a roads plan that would ONLY raise the gas tax if the legislature agreed to cut the income tax rate from 7 to 5 percent over 10 years. Haley: ""If we do all of those things, we will have better roads and a stronger economic engine for our people...That's a win-win."" Haley projected more than $300 million a year in new infrastructure revenue, while the tax cut would save taxpayers more than $1.7 billion a year, and taxpayers would still net almost $5.6 billion in savings over 10 years.  Grover Norquist, head of the anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform, supported Haley's proposal: ""Grover Norquist, the primary promoter of politicians pledging not to raise taxes, is urging South Carolina lawmakers to support Gov. Nikki Haley's roads plan that includes a cut in the state's income tax."" Haley also wanted to change how infrastructure money was being spent: ""Next, let's change the way we spend our infrastructure dollars and get rid of the legislatively elected transportation commission so the condition of South Carolina's roads is no longer driven by shortsighted regionalism and political horse trading, and we stop wasting our tax money."" Haley's roads plan died in the legislature. Gas taxes were NOT increased under her tenure.","","",""

With life expectancy decreasing, her call to raise the retirement age makes no sense.  In a 2023 interview with Bloomberg News, Haley asserted that the retirement age of 65 is ""way too low."" Haley also proposed ""instead of cost of living increases, we do it based on inflation"". The interviewer repeatedly asked Haley ""what is the right age"", in her view, for retirement. Haley refused to give a straight answer, suggesting that she had not thought it through.   Haley on the retirement age: ""Well, I think we have to do the numbers. We've gotta figure out what it is. But what we do know is 65 is way too low. And we need to increase that. We need to do it according to life expectancy.""   New York Times: ""Anyone who says, as Haley does, that the retirement age should rise in line with increasing life expectancy is being oblivious, perhaps willfully, to the grim inequality of modern America. Until Covid struck, average life expectancy at 65, the relevant number, was indeed rising. But these gains were concentrated among Americans with relatively high incomes . Less affluent Americans — those who depend most on Social Security — have seen little increase in life expectancy and, in some cases, declines. …So anyone invoking rising life expectancy as a reason to delay Social Security benefits is, in effect, saying that aging janitors must keep working (or be cast into extreme poverty) because bankers are living longer.""  Nikki Haley talks about ""reforming"" Social Security, but she never provides any specifics to help Americans understand how her plans might affect them. Could it be that she does not understand policy well enough to elaborate? As the Wall Street Journal wrote last month, Haley's incoherent views on Social Security show her ""limited command of policy.""  Wall Street Journal: ""An exchange on Social Security illustrates... [Haley's] limited command of policy. She has the backbone to say the U.S. must raise the retirement age. But she is unfamiliar with an idea to tweak how benefits are calculated—basing adjustments on rising prices instead of rising wages—that could help address the shortfall with less political pain. ""That's interesting,"" she says. Then she turns to an aide: ""Remind me to look at that.""   Nikki Haley has since proven that she does not have the ""backbone"" that the WSJ commended. In her January 2024 town hall with Fox News, Haley tried to rewrite history, falsely claiming ""I have never once said that"" the retirement age is too low.  Nikki Haley's poor grasp of policy, combined with her eagerness to appease her billionaire donors, creates a disastrous combination. Haley will not hesitate to sell out American seniors and cut social security – though of course she won't consider cutting spending on Ukraine. Her allegiance is to her donors, the media, and the left – not conservatives.","","",""

Haley's policy agenda is friendly to Silicon Valley titans; she has vowed that on her first day in office, her administration would work with Big Tech to collect data on all internet users.   Weeks ago, Haley met with Wall Street elites including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who has spearheaded the destructive ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investing agenda that seeks to destroy American energy independence.

DES MOINES, Iowa – After beating Nikki Haley and winning tonight's CNN debate, Ron DeSantis spoke with CNN's Anderson Cooper and KCCI's Amanda Rooker. Read the highlights below. Watch the full CNN interview HERE. On how DeSantis supporters will be the most committed on caucus night:  I do better when I'm underestimated. I like being the underdog. And so, I'm not a prognosticator. I think if you look at what we've done here, the organization that we built, the tens of thousands of Iowans that have already committed to caucus, everything, we've done it the right way. We've gone to all ninety-nine counties. And I think you're seeing that. You're going to start to see that more and more even through the weekend...my people are going to come out in negative 20 [degrees]. They're going to come out and do it. But at the same time, you know, I'd rather be underestimated, so I hope everyone says all that and then on caucus night, you know, we're going to do well.  On Chris Christie's hot mic moment:  I've been to Fallujah and Ramadi. I mean, this is nothing. I did call [Chris Christie], just because I felt he was being treated poorly...and I think a lot of it is, and he and I have both kind of needled Nikki Haley on it, Chris is against Trump, right? Nikki is becoming a darling of the people who are more than ever Trump. And yet, she won't answer the question about whether she would accept the VP nod. And she gives all these mealy-mouthed responses. What's wrong with just saying it? No, I would not under any circumstances say that. And I think the fact that she has not done that is part of the reason Chris had been staying in. And I think that's part of the reason I think he's had those choice words.  On Nikki Haley's liberal billionaire donors:  She's got the founder of LinkedIn who's a liberal Democrat...she's got Blackrock CEO...we kneecapped ESG in Florida. We took money out, moved Blackrock out of our pension. She's bragged about being there with Larry Fink, he's the king of ESG. So, I mean, those people were never in my camp. She's got a lot of people who are, I think, more liberal donors. And then the question is, why? I think a lot of it is because they're never Trumpers. That's why I find it odd that she just won't say she won't be the VP.  Watch the full KCCI interview HERE. On why he's the best candidate compared to Donald Trump and Nikki Haley:  We were able to do what I think that Iowans want to see: articulate a vision for leadership, but also hold accountable both Nikki Haley and Donald Trump. But we did do that at the appropriate times. You know, I think you have a contrast. I've done all 99 counties. We've worked really hard in the state. I think that's what you have to do. Nikki Haley, when she's in another state, she says Iowa's votes need to be corrected. I don't think Iowans need to be corrected. I think they take pride in this process. We also were able to talk about a lot of the things that she was talking about. I've already done this stuff. I did universal school choice. She did not. Kim Reynolds did here in Iowa. Of course, she has endorsed me. So, I think it was a contrast. But I really represent a candidate running on bold colors, focusing on putting the interests of the American people first. She's really running on pale pastels, kind of the warmed-over corporatism, a U.N. style Republicanism that our voters have moved away from. That's not what they want anymore. And I think you saw that contrast.  On how Trump is not working to earn the votes of Iowans and takes them for granted:  They talked about Donald Trump saying he was going to send in federal resources to go out for the inner city crime. He was president during the BLM riots. He did not go out and take care of those riots. We were telling him you have every right to do it. He was tweeting ""LAW AND ORDER,"" ... we were able to hold them accountable for that and talk about that. Also some of the COVID authoritarianism that started under his watch with Dr. Fauci--that was wrong. We're going to bring a reckoning for that. And the fact that we have this terrible immigration crisis, and that if he had built the border wall, Biden would not have been able to bring in 8 million people. I do think though, you need to be on the stage. He thumbed his nose at the people of Iowa. He did a town hall here on another network because he didn't want to debate. He doesn't go out and do events where he takes questions from people. He'll swoop in or give a speech and leave. That's not the type of things that Iowans expect. You've got to earn this nomination. The fact that he's not been willing to debate the whole time-- I think Iowans think you got to get up there. You got to get under the lights. You got to take the hostile fire, and you got to be able to defend your record.","","",""

The truth is DeSantis was an avid proponent of raising the retirement age and voted to do so in Congress THREE TIMES.He only changed his position to copy Donald Trump. Fact checkers called his claim ""misleading."" Lie #1: Ron DeSantis supports raising the retirement age. Congressman DeSantis voted for budget resolutions that would have raised the retirement age to 70 in 2013, 2014, and 2015. In 2012, Ron DeSantis told a local Florida newspaper that Social Security was unsustainable and was never intended for people to be retiring at ""65 or 67"" if they are going to live into their eighties. WATCH VIDEO HERE. DESANTIS: Now it's running a deficit, so there's nothing left in Social Security. It's guys like me pay into it, and then people who are on Social Security, the check immediately goes out to them. We're now taking in less than the checks are going out, and so that problem is going to get worse, but I think for people in my generation, my life expectancy–and again I wouldn't change it for people who are on it now–but my life expectancy is, it's improved. I was born in '78, and it's probably improved five or six years, just on average. That tends to annoy people when I tell them I'm gonna be around for a few more years longer, but it's true. And so, me getting Social Security at 65 or 67, if I'm gonna live for into my 80s, is probably not sustainable. When Social Security was created, the age that you received the benefit was actually higher than the life expectancy was. And so it was a, it was kind of a can't lose system from the government's perspective. They taxed everyone 1% and a lot of people that ended up getting anything. And I don't know if that was just the way because they wanted it to eventually evolve in the way it is now, but the system was not originally designed for people to be on it for 30 years. So we just have to understand that, that it's a mathematical problem. And to allow people like me, who have a lot longer to go, to be able to make some changes for us. Lie #2: DeSantis said that ""Life expectancy is declining in this country. It's tragic. But it's true."" This is false.  Life expectancy dropped during COVID but rebounded last year. When Social Security started, life expectancy was 58 for men and 62 for women. Today, life expectancy is 74 for men and 79 for women. Lie #3: DeSantis accused Haley of wanting to raise the retirement age for all retirees.  False. Haley has ONLY called for adjusting the retirement age for younger workers in their twenties like her children.","","",""

As a state lawmaker and governor of South Carolina, Haley embraced big government spending on corporate welfare, including almost $1 billion taxpayer subsidies to Boeing. A few years later, Boeing appointed Haley to a lucrative board seat. Haley also used state resources to court Chinese investment as governor. The record is clear: Haley will cave to special interests instead of doing what's right for the American people. Stopping reckless spending and standing up to the CCP means keeping the Bank of Boeing far away from the White House. THE FACTS  Boeing:  As a state legislator, Nikki Haley supported a corporate welfare package for Boeing valued at $900 million in order to lure the company to Charleston.   Two years later, Boeing was one of the largest corporate donors to Nikki Haley's inauguration committee.   As Governor, Nikki Haley signed legislation that gave subsidies worth about $120 million to Boeing, a move that drew protests from the Tea Party movement.   Boeing appointed Haley to its board in 2019. She stepped down in 2020, after collecting over $300,000 in cash and stock.  China:   As a candidate, Nikki Haley has called on American businesses to get out of China. But there is no record that suggests she wanted Boeing to close their factory near Shanghai, which opened just months before she was nominated to the board.   During her time as the governor of South Carolina, Haley welcomed China-based companies to the state with open arms. One owner of a Chinese business that Haley welcomed to South Carolina specifically thanked ""the good support provided by both county and state governments.""","","",""

Haley has criticized Trump on big issues:  Israel  Haley criticized Trump in her recent Republican Jewish Coalition speech for obsessing over grievances with Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and failing to offer Israel his full-throated support right after October 7. Ukraine  Haley criticized Trump for backtracking on his previous support for Ukraine: ""President Trump used to have it right when it came to Russia and Ukraine. He reversed the Obama strategy and he sent Javelin missiles to Ukraine, and I was proud to serve with him then. He's now backtracked now and is going into where he's weak in the knees on Russia again."" China  In a major foreign policy speech on China, Haley criticized Trump for being ""almost singularly focused"" on the U.S.-China trade relationship, but doing ""too little about the rest of the Chinese threat."" She also criticized Trump for congratulating Xi Jinping on the Chinese Communist Party's 70th anniversary. Spending  During the first debate, Haley said: ""No one is telling the American people the truth. The truth is that Biden didn't do this to us. Our Republicans did this to us too. When they passed that $2.2 trillion COVID stimulus bill, they left us with 90 million people on Medicaid, 42 million people on food stamps. No one has told you how to fix it... You have Ron DeSantis, you've got Tim Scott, you've got Mike Pence — they all voted to raise the debt. And Donald Trump added $8 trillion to our debt. Our kids are never going to forgive us for this."" Entitlements  During her CNN town hall, Haley criticized Trump for saying he would ignore the looming entitlement crisis: ""And I know that Trump and DeSantis have both said we're not going to deal with entitlement reform, well all you're doing is leaving it for the next president, and that's leaving a lot of Americans in trouble."" Electability  Haley regularly points out that she beats Biden by a much larger margin than Trump: ""I think it shows the other candidates, Trump included, win by two, three points over Biden. If you look in those same polls, I beat Biden by 10, 13 points.""","","",""

He highlighted his vision for the country while also calling out Trump for not defending his record on the debate stage and highlighting Haley's flip-flops on issues that matter to Republican voters. Here's What They Are Saying:  Brittany Jean: This is DeSantis' best debate. He knows the facts are on his side and he is using them all to destroy Nikki Haley Scott Jennings: DeSantis smart to steer it back to the education policy/school choice stuff, away from Haley going nuts on campaign inside baseball. #CNNdebate Frank Luntz: DeSantis won this evening's #GOPDebate. His performance was the best of his career. Abby Phillip: It was a strong night for DeSantis. Curtis Houk: .@RonDeSantis is exactly right. This election must be a referendum on Joe Biden and ""the failures of the Democratic Party."" If it's about trials and relitigating the last election, then it'll be an election the media can't wait for and voters will act accordingly. Michael Brendan Dougherty: In general, DeSantis is more substantive. He's done his homework. Nikki Haley is more relatable, if you are currently tired and unpleasant. LG Jeanette Nuñez: .@RonDeSantis has a proven track record of delivering results. Unlike Nikki Haley, he won't bend the knee or cave to the left. Dana Loesch: This is the worst debate Haley has had. She comes across as Hillary 2.0: petty, whiny, playing the woman card, while DeSantis seems confident and amused. Katie Pavlich: DeSantis promises a reckoning against the federal government agencies that violated the U.S. Constitution during the pandemic. Vaccine mandates, mask mandates, school lockdowns, closing of worship, all of it. Scott Jennings: ""ballistic podiatry"" - that will remain with us for awhile. #CNNdebate Miranda Devine: This incessant sniping from Haley, calling DeSantis a liar every two minutes, is grating. DeSantis got in one zinger, which drew a few laughs, accusing her of ""ballistic podiatry"" aka shooting herself in the foot. Curtis Houck: Ron DeSantis is calm, collected, and the longer this debate has gone on, he's still firing. He's not tired or flustered. #GOPDebate Steve Deace: Haley is rushed and just noticeably less poised. Her substance, for her message, isn't all that bad and she's doing better there than I anticipated. But the presentation isn't presidential. On style points, DeSantis is dominating. Scott Jennings: DeSantis is channeling the correct attitude and energy on immigration. Haley using the ""jump the line"" idea also effective, but I think DeSantis won the exchange. #CNNdebate NRO: Once again, DeSantis is talking about actual accomplishments, such as getting school choice done, and Haley keeps responding by attacking DeSantis campaign spending and bad polling. Scott Jennings: DeSantis UN quip on Haley will stick. Yowza. That one cut deep. #CNNdebate Julia Johnson: That DeSantis one liner was good Rich Lowry: Nikki Haley has spent a lot of the night looking annoyed Philip Wegmann: DeSantis with a brutal barb: You can take the ambassador out of the United Nations but you can't take the United Nations out of the ambassadors. New York Post: DeSantis savages Haley's 'UN way of thinking' New York Post: DeSantis cites kid's 'John Kerry' burn to hit Haley on child gender transitions Scott Jennings: not a single voter cares about the inside baseball of campaign operations. Ryan Saavedra: If your only rebuttal to your opponent is repeatedly telling people to go to a website full of half truths and political spin, you're not a strong candidate. Chris Loesch:  ""Leadership is about getting things done."" ~ @RonDeSantis Philip Wegmann: At the first commercial break: DeSantis is giving arguably his best debate performance yet (ie the UN line) Haley is hitting back just as hard, giving him 'the Vivek treatment' (ie the drinking game line) Tapper and Bash are steering the debate toward substance and policy. Steve Deace: DeSantis is very composed and poised thus far, and clearly coming across as more presidential. However, I also think he's missed a couple of easy rebuts/punches that would've only required going off his play sheet briefly. Dana Loesch: DeSantis is smart to bring every issue right back to a jab at Haley and refuse to let Trump be a focus without being present. Frank Luntz: ...I've been critical of him, but he's on fire tonight. #GOPDebate Scott Jennings: DeSantis UN quip on Haley will stick. Yowza. That one cut deep. #CNNdebate Ryan Saavedra: If your only rebuttal to your opponent is repeatedly telling people to go to a website full of half truths and political spin, you're not a strong candidate.

The bathroom bill came up in 2016. At the time there were very few cases of students wanting to use a bathroom that didn't match their gender. Haley argued that local schools and parents could work it out by finding a private, separate bathroom, but insisted boys' bathrooms should be used by biological males and girls' bathrooms should be used by biological females. Haley has been outspoken about protecting women's sports and keeping biological males out of women's locker rooms and bathrooms.

If you think this kind of aggressive bullying isn't part of the problem, you're not paying attention. Twitter: This is a women's rights issue. Calling all feminists. This is not ok. Why is this not getting more attention? Because men's sports are not impacted by this. #SpeakUpForOurGirls Twitter: ""Girl power"" would be letting women compete against women—not biological males.

Ron DeSantis touting the governor's leadership that his presidential campaign says will be played at all events going forward. Billy Dean, a member of the Florida Music Hall of Fame with 3 certified gold albums and 11 Billboard country music top hits to his credit, recorded a song called ""Never Back Down"" which the DeSantis team used to produce a music video supporting the governor. ""The fight is tough, you gotta stand your ground, and if you still believe in the American Dream then never back down, never back down, never back down, and if you still believe in living free, never back down,"" Dean sings in the song. The song continues, ""They shame us just because we love our country, attacking everything that we hold dear. They shame us for our faith, our flag, our family, so why the hell are they still living here?"" ""I'm a Florida native and resident, who has lived the American Dream,"" Dean, nominated for a Grammy in 1992 for his song ""Somewhere In My Broken Heart"", told Fox News Digital on Wednesday. ""My dad served in WW2 and lost 2 brothers Harold Mason Dean and Robert Lloyd Dean to the cause. They sacrificed their dreams so I could live mine.

Eastern Europe is no exception. Haley's policy on Ukraine is almost identical to Joe Biden's: Give the Ukrainian government everything they ask for, with no clear objectives or end game. However, Haley has gone one step further with a radical proposal that is a bridge too far, even for Biden. Last month, she vowed to invite Ukraine into NATO, which would create a collective defense obligation for the United States as a NATO member. Haley's ill-considered plan would mean sending U.S. troops to Ukraine to fight Russia. In an interview with Megyn Kelly following the December 2023 GOP debate, Haley said: ""The way you end Ukraine, is if you went and said to Ukraine, we will invite you into NATO."" Then:  Haley argued that Russia has never invaded a NATO member state. However, this argument does not apply to an active conflict zone like Ukraine.   Haley offered the examples of Georgia and Moldova as non-NATO countries that Russia invaded – but neither of those countries has been offered NATO membership, in part due to concerns that pre-existing conflicts would draw all NATO members into hot war with Russia.  In response to Haley's reckless demand for Ukraine to become a NATO member, Kelly pointed out: ""But then if Putin does continue fighting with Ukraine and they come in NATO, then we have to fight. We have to get involved.""  Kelly was referring to the North Atlantic Treaty's Article 5, which enshrines the principle of collective defense.   An attack on one NATO ally is considered the same as an attack against all NATO allies. Therefore, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine would require the U.S. military to fight for Ukrainian territory just as if it were American territory.  Put simply, accepting Ukraine into NATO during an active conflict with Russia would necessarily bring the U.S. and all other NATO countries into that conflict directly. Haley's proposal is both dangerous and unrealistic – another reminder that making speeches at the U.N. and giving handouts to Chinese corporations is not the same as substantive foreign policy experience. If only Haley and the liberal donors she caves to cared as much about securing our southern border as they care about defending Ukraine's border.","","",""

When Walter Scott was shot and killed in April 2015 by a white police officer, Haley held her state together and passed the first body camera bill in the country. Haley: ""In South Carolina we did things differently. After the horrendous death of Walter Scott, we didn't have violence. As a state, we came together, black and white, Republican and Democrat. We communicated constantly – with religious leaders, with political leaders, with community leaders. We saw the need for justice and immediately brought charges against the offending officer. But we went further than that. Two months, to the day, after the shooting of Walter Scott, our Republican-controlled General Assembly passed a body camera bill. A few days later, Mr. Scott's family stood with me when I signed the bill into law.""  In June 2015, when a white supremacist killed nine black South Carolinians while they were praying at church, Haley focused on uniting her state and preventing the riots that had engulfed other states in similar situations. Haley brought both sides together to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina state grounds. Haley is outspoken about her belief that ""America is not racist."" The Hill: Haley criticizes US 'self-loathing': America is not a racist country Daily Mail: Obama cynically attacked me after I dared to say America is NOT racist. But if Democrats get their way, black and brown kids will think they're inferior and have no place in our country Politico: Nikki Haley: It is a 'lie' that America is racist","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370633",10478,"DES MOINES, Iowa – First Lady Casey DeSantis and conservative leaders backing Ron DeSantis are taking to the airwaves highlighting his hard work in the Hawkeye State and his track record of winning big fights for the American people in preparation for his CNN debate with Nikki Haley. First Lady Casey DeSantis on KCCI ""Ron will not let you down.""  Chip Roy on The Lead with Jake Tapper, CNN ""I just want to see the governor keep doing what he's been doing since I've been on the campaign trail with him and as long as he has been in office standing up for the people that he represents. He's done a phenomenal job. There's a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of energy. He's on the right trajectory. With all due respect, Governor Haley's been stumbling. It's hardly been a day over the last two weeks where there hasn't been a gaffe where she's basically mocking the people of Iowa saying the people in New Hampshire need to correct Iowans. I think we'll see tonight in the debate, some pretty good exchanges.""  Senator Josh Kimbrell on CNN ""You're right, a lot of people raise their eyebrows when they hear South Carolina Senator endorsing the governor of Florida over the former governor of South Carolina. There's reason for that. I'm a native South Carolinian born and raised here lived here my whole life and been involved in politics even back during the Halley administration. And Ron DeSantis is the conservative that Hayley always claimed to be. Governor Haley, unfortunately, campaigned as a conservative didn't really govern as a conservative and Governor DeSantis campaigned and governed as a conservative. So there's an authenticity question at play here.""  Congressman Thomas Massie on CNN ""Like he says, Donald trump is running on his issues, Nikki Haley is running on her donors' issues, and Ron DeSantis is running on the people's issues. The biggest contrast that I see is under Trump, we saw our national debt go up eight trillion dollars, whereas in Florida in that same period of time, Ron DeSantis brought down their debt down 25%.""  Deputy Campaign Manager David Polyansky on CNN ""Nikki Haley has stopped taking questions from voters, and certainly from the press. Tonight, she's not going to be able to hide like she has in past debates. And on this stage tonight, Governor DeSantis will force her to answer those tough questions and to defend her failed record.""  Bob Vander Plaats on Newsmax ""A combined [$44 million] of ads have gone against DeSantis by Donald Trump and Nikki Haley — because they see him as the clear alternative to the former president.""  Congressman Chip Roy on I'm Right with Jesse Kelly ""The media doesn't like Ron DeSantis, because frankly, the guy has delivered. He's delivered at every level in Florida, whether you're talking about taking on Anthony Fauci when President Trump gave him a commendation on the way out of office after shutting down the greatest economy in the history of the world, forcing vaccines and mandates on people, mask mandates and shutting down schools. Governor DeSantis was a beacon of hope. He opened his economy up. People moved to Florida. That's the kind of leadership we want. I want a guy that sent a plane load of illegal aliens to Martha's Vineyard, helping us actually save the election when the Republicans were on their heels. That's leadership.""  Congressman Chip Roy on the Steve Deace Show ""Governor DeSantis is the only guy I've seen in my lifetime, going all the way back to Ronald Reagan, that I can be extremely excited about not just who he is but what he's doing; not just what he's doing, but who he is. All of that together is what leadership actually looks like. And on the campaign trail, people are seeing that, they're responding to that, they get it.""  Congressman Chip Roy on The Story with Martha Macallum, Fox News ""The governor has done really hard work hitting all 99 counties, 240 events. He's been shaking hands meeting with people. I was out yesterday traveling with Casey DeSantis. We met with rooms it was with 15 people, 25 people, 20 people all throughout southeast Iowa, on the bus in the snow coming back last night. We were having lots of conversation with folks who, frankly, they want a vision going forward. We just saw in your all's previous segment, all of the focus and the attention on the president's legal issues in this election is very much becoming about his issues. And for Nikki Haley, with all due respect, they're about her donors' issues. And for Governor DeSantis, they're about the people's issues. And we talk about those to the people. We talk about border security and how he's delivered. And we talk about spending, standing up to Anthony Fauci, driving the debt down by 25% in Florida. People are excited about somebody who can deliver without all the drama. And with all due respect to Nikki Haley, saying that you shouldn't have to lie to get elected, or whatever her quote was, on this stage last night, she looked at the people, and she said that she didn't look at Hillary Clinton as an inspiration. If you literally listened to her own book that she recorded in her own voice, she described Hillary Clinton as an inspiration. If that's true, just own it.""  Deputy Campaign Manager David Polyansky on Newsmax ""Well, number one, Donald Trump has never won an Iowa caucus. And in fact, it was Ted Cruz that beat him in 2016. And we didn't have one a few years ago when the former president was the nominee. But the message is pretty simple and straightforward. And you've heard this from Governor DeSantis all across the last week, and you'll see it for the remaining week. He feels that Donald Trump is running on his issues. He feels that Nikki Haley is running for her donors' issues. And Ron DeSantis is running for Iowa voters' issues. And that's the difference here. And I think you've seen that. When every caucus site in this state - 721 of them, every person that attends will have had the opportunity to meet Ron DeSantis. They can't say that about Donald Trump. And they certainly can't say that about Nikki Haley. And that's a huge advantage.  Congressman Chip Roy on Your World with Neil Cavuto, Fox News ""Governor DeSantis, I was just meeting with some folks here in southeast Iowa, the rooms have been packed. There's a lot of energy and enthusiasm. They want a new vision. Somebody that can carry us forward. Who can serve for eight years. Somebody who's delivered for the people of Florid. Who won by one million and a half votes. Who won 62% of Hispanic voters, 50% of single female voters. He's a guy that gets it done, he challenged Disney. He challenged the education establishment. He took on the teachers' unions. He flipped Miami Dade. He's doing all the things you want in a president and when the people of Iowa hear that, see that man, they are excited.""  Congressman Chip Roy on The Source with Kaitlin Collins, CNN ""I want to have somebody I know can win in the fall like Governor DeSantis did in Florida, but also we're not looking backwards, trying to relitigate, looking backwards to January 6. I want someone to look forwards. I want somebody who can serve for eight years. I want us to get out of this rut, provide a vision for the country. And Governor DeSantis is the guy to do that. And that's why I'm out campaigning for him hard. He's hit 99 counties, 240 events, I think across the state of Iowa. Today, I was out with Casey DeSantis meeting with a bunch of folks throughout rural Iowa. There's a lot of enthusiasm and look he's trending up and present former President Trump is trending down. And frankly, Nikki Haley is plummeting after she embarrassed herself saying that Iowans should be corrected by New Hampshire.""  First Lady Casey DeSantis on NewsRadio 1110 KFAB ""I will say, just from my unique vantage point with Ron, watching him at home with a seven, five, and a three year old, and watching him in front of the cameras fighting the good fight, no matter how hard they come after him, no matter what they say about him, he will not let you down. He will not back down. He will not waver. When he tells the people that he will get it done -- whether it's building the wall, restoring the American dream, ensuring that education is just about that, not indoctrination, to ensure that these unaccountable bureaucracies in Washington are tamed, that we're reducing it by 50% -- when he says he'll do it, he does it. And that's the kind of fighter with a backbone of steel, as Rush Limbaugh said on his final show, that we need in Washington now more than ever, somebody who is going to put service over self, who's going to get the job done, and serve the people with honor and distinction. And he will absolutely do that.""  Congressman Chip Roy on the Glenn Beck Program ""I'm on the ground in Iowa, okay. 'm meeting with voters every day, very focused voters and they are ready to rumble. They are ready for a change. They are sick and tired of what's going on in the swamp. They want somebody new they want a new direction. They want some change. And not to get into the political side - I'm out here stumping for Governor DeSantis, obviously. But they want somebody who will actually do what they friggin said they would do like Governor DeSantis did in Florida. And look, he's never flip flopped. And I heard on your show earlier you asked about Vivek. I like Vivek. He says a lot of great things. But he's flip flopped a million times on vaccines, on Trump, COVID generally. I could go down the list. Governor DeSantis delivered up and down. And so Governor DeSantis cut spending Governor DeSantis took on Fauci. Governor DeSantis took on COVID tyranny. He took on Disney and won. He's now got Miami Dade teachers unions on the run. He got universal school choice passed. He's got an economy booming. That guy is actually a machine. I've never seen anything like it. And I've worked for good people. You know that. Guy is crushing it. And he's doing great out here in Iowa.""  Bob Vander Plaats on Need to Know with Jeff Angelo, WHO radio ""I tell people Tuesday, I've been a friend of the former President Donald Trump for over a dozen years. This is not against the former president. This just happens believe I think Governor DeSantis is the right guy at the right time to win in '24, to lead on Day One, and to lead for two terms. And I think the party needs this. But I think more than anything, America needs this. And that's why I'm throwing my support behind Governor DeSantis.""","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/369219",23459,"I appreciate you being here, I appreciate your support. You know, we start these town halls the same way I've started them the same way ever since we were up at Saint Anselm's in June to tell you why, why we're in this race. And we're in this race to tell the truth. From the beginning, we've been in this race to tell the truth. Fact is that as we were watching this race come together. From where Mary Pat and I were sitting at home in New Jersey, we were really concerned that nobody would tell the truth in this race about what's really at stake. And no one would tell the truth about Donald Trump. No one would tell the truth about his divisiveness, his stoking of anger for his own benefit, him putting himself before the people of this country, myself included who gave him the honor of being President of United States from 2017 to 2021. Personal ambition is a necessary element for any political candidate. You got to get out of bed in the morning and be able to really believe in your heart that you have something to offer to folks that's better and different. And so I have no argument with people who are involved in politics being ambitious. You need to have it, but it can't be what governs your decision making. Ambition can't be what makes you decide how to do things as a public figure. It could just be the fuel that gets you out of bed, that gets you in front of a room like this, that gets you on the phone raising money, that gets you working for people who you believe in and gets you working for yourself. I made a political decision eight years ago. When I dropped out of the race in 2016, I looked at the polls and I decided that Donald Trump was going to be the nominee, and that since I'd known him for 15 years, that I can make him a better candidate and if he won, maybe a better president. I knew his flaws, but I also knew he was going to win the nomination. So I decided that I would get behind him and support him. I let the ambition get ahead and in control of the decision making. And after I figured that out, I promised myself and I promised my wife that I would never, ever do that again. And I'm not going to. So for all the people who have been in this race, who have put their own personal ambition ahead of what's right. They will ultimately have to answer the same questions that I had to answer after my decision in 2016. Those questions don't ever leave. In fact, they're really stubborn. They stay. And so I know how I'm answering those questions. I've never believed that Donald Trump was a foregone conclusion as our nominee in this race, and I knew that the case had to be made against him. Now there are people in our party who are resigned the fact that he was going to be the nominee, resigned with the fact that the case didn't even need to be made because it would be a waste of time. They sat on the sidelines and all they did was voice their opposition in private, behind closed doors, quietly so no one could hear. And that's not leadership, everybody. That's cowardice. It's cowardice and it's hypocrisy. As a party we need to be willing to take the responsibility for the part we've played in getting here. Our country is angry. It's divided. It's accomplishing little and it is leaving our citizens to be exhausted. You just look at what's happening just in the last few days. Good people who got into politics, I believe, for the right reasons. People like Senator John Barrasso, people like Congressman Tom Emmer stand up and endorse Donald Trump. They know better, I know they know better. People who continue to deny the results of the 2020 election, people in leadership in the House who go on TV and say that the people who attacked the Capitol on January 6th are hostages. I'll tell you who hostages are, the Israelis who are still being hidden in tunnels in Gaza against their will, out of no fault of their own. These people speak louder for the folks who attacked our Capitol on January 6th, than they are willing to stand up and speak for the people of Israel who are in tunnels in Gaza. That's not leadership. That's the ambition and cowardice which has outstripped their otherwise good judgment. We want to change this party and if we want to change this country, it's hard work. It's not easy. From the moment I got into the race, the decision that I made was really simple. I would rather lose by telling the truth, then lie in order to win. And I feel no differently today, because this is a fight for the soul of our party and the soul of our country. Why have we resisted the calls to drop out of this race? Because unlike some of the other candidates, we're fighting for something bigger than ourselves. We're fighting for something bigger than self-interest. We're fighting for something bigger than the next title. I've got plenty of titles, enough titles to last me the rest of my life. U.S. Attorney, Governor, husband, father, son, brother. I had enough titles to last me for the rest of my life, we are fighting for something bigger. It is something that conventional wisdom thinkers just can't possibly understand and so they've been saying for weeks and weeks and weeks, because some polls that I should drop out of the race, that I should get out for that reason. The smallness of the campaign's who spend more time arguing and worrying about who should get out of the race than they have spent going after the frontrunner. They spend all their time saying, oh, Christie should get out, Scott should get out, Pence should get out, Hutchinson should get out, Burgum should get out. They and their donors have a different target every day to try to minimize the attention to their own campaign and how their own campaign is a campaign that doesn't play to win. It's a campaign that plays to not offend. The problems in our country, the divisions and influx at our border. The problems with our enormous debt. The failures of our education system. All of those things and much more will not be solved by people who are too afraid to talk about what the real problems are. If we ever have a hope of restoring this party to be a governing party of principles, we have to be willing to do the hard work and take some of the heat that comes with it. We have candidates in this race who have run away from forums where they were afraid they were going to be booed. I run into the forums where I know I'm going to be booed because being booed for telling the truth is a badge of honor. I'm proud of everything we've said and done so far and I'm proud of all the people who have supported us and are willing to do what needs to be done to restore the soul of our country. Because in the end, all those issues that we've talked about at all the town halls, they're all really important, but they're no more important than the most important issue, and that is the character of the candidate. You don't know what's going to come across the next president's desk. You think you can predict it, but you can't. No one asked George W. Bush or Al Gore what they would do if four airliners were hijacked and flown into symbols of American power and killing thousands of Americans. No one asked them that in New Hampshire in 2000, but I was glad we had a man of character sitting behind the desk in the Oval Office when that attack came, because I knew George Bush would do everything he needed to do to protect this country and its people and put them first, not himself first. Imagine, just for a moment, if 9/11 had happened with Donald Trump behind the desk, the first thing he would have done was run to the bunker to protect himself. He would have put himself first before this country. And anyone who is unwilling to say that he is unfit to be president of the United States, is unfit themselves to be president of the United States. Campaigns are run to win, that's why we do them. I see the chairman here in New Hampshire, he knows we run campaigns to win. My goal has never been to be just a voice against the hate and the division and the selfishness of what our party has become under Donald Trump. It's also been to win the nomination and defeat Joe Biden and restore our party and our country to a new place of hope and optimism in this country. I've always said that if there came a point in time in this race where I couldn't see a path to accomplishing that goal. that I would get out. And it's clear to me tonight, that there isn't a path for me to win the nomination, which is why I'm suspending my campaign tonight for president of the United States. I know and I could see it from some of the faces here that I'm disappointing some people by doing this, people who believe in our message and believe in what we've been doing. I also know, though, it's the right thing for me to do. Because I want to promise you this, I am going to make sure that in no way do I enable Donald Trump to ever be president of the United States again and that's more important than my own personal ambition. So we have to decide now, we have to decide in the next ten months, who do we want to be as a country? We forget that people are walking thousands of miles still to get here. We talk about the problems and the border and there are problems, and we have to fix them and we have to secure our border, and we have to do it in a way that's smart and sensible and will work, because it's not right to have a porous southern border in this country. But I want you to remember something, those people who are coming over that border, many of them are walking hundreds, if not thousands of miles to get there, because here is where they see hope. Here is where they see freedom. Here is where they see success. Here is where they see that flag, which means for them, thousands of miles away in other countries all of those principles. We are still the indispensable nation for the rest of the world. We need to be the indispensable nation once again to each other. We need to believe in America as much as they believe in America. Right now, they believe in America in a way that this country angry, divided with selfish leadership who puts their own ambition first isn't doing for our country anymore. We need to change that and every election is an opportunity to change it. We have people in this race who all they will do is tell you how bad everything is, how angry we should be. And there's certainly sufficient reason for anger at the failures of the leaders we've selected. But they're doing it not for that reason, it's not a moment of honesty and transparency, believe me, it's not. It's because they believe when we get angry, what we'll do is naturally relate to the angriest voice in the room. Donald Trump wants you to be angry every day because he's angry. He wants you to be angry so that you'll relate to his anger, and then to vote for him. Please understand this, I have known him well for 22 years, more than anybody else in this race has known him. And I can promise you this, if you put him back behind the desk in the Oval Office, and a choice comes and a decision is needed to be made as to whether he puts himself first or he puts you first. How much more evidence do you need that he will pick himself? And if that is what we have there, then people are going to remain angry, remain divided and become even more exhausted than they are today. The country that I think we should choose is the country that recognizes that our differences have always been our strength, not a weakness, not something to divide us in anger us. But our differences have been our strength, we've come from different countries at different times to different places, with different skills, with different religions. And yet only here can those people become an American. You can't go to Germany and become a German, you can't come to Great Britain and become British, but you can come here and become an American, a real part of this country. The moment we become a place where people no longer want to come in search of a better, freer, stronger nation, that will be the real problem that will be harder to solve. We back our allies around the world and they shouldn't have to think twice about having America's support, yet we have petty politics interfering with supporting freedom fighters in Ukraine. We have petty politics interfering with defending our friends in Israel. We have petty politics interfering with making sure Taiwan is armed to fight off the Chinese. They use the border as an excuse not to do those things. How about we have a country where we can do all those things? Because leadership aspires to something greater, not appealing to the lowest common denominator, which is what the leadership of the last decade and a half in the White House has done, including the current president. We need a country that once again feels like everyone has a stake in what we're doing that we can bring people together, and it's hard, it's hard to do that. I did it for eight years in New Jersey, in a Democratic state with a Republican governor. It's hard because we have real disagreements, but those disagreements are small compared to the things that we have in common. But it takes effort, we have to work at it. We have to believe that the other person has a rightful place in our country. We have to believe that whether we agree with them or not, they got elected to and they have a right to have a voice and to be heard and to have a vote and to have it count. This race has always been bigger than me. It's bigger than any one person if you do it the right way. I tried to change the conversation in this race. I tried to force a conversation in this race, a conversation about the real thing that's going on here. I stood on those debate stages, every one of them. The pundits in the media and the professional politicians who worked for other campaigns said, I wasn't going to make any of them. Before every debate, no Christie won't make this one, he'll only make this one, I made every one of them. But when I stood on there, I watched the other candidates arguing with each other as if the race was between us, pretending as if the guy who's in front and wasn't there, wasn't to be spoken about. Like Voldemort in the Harry Potter books, He Who shall not be named. Because they feared even bringing up his name would make him appear with his magical mystical powers to end their political careers. So they say ridiculous things. make ridiculous points. And let me tell you, if Donald Trump becomes the nominee of this party, the moment that it happened was when Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott and Mike Pence and Doug Burgum and Vivek Ramaswamy stood on that stage in Milwaukee in August and when we were asked, would you support someone who is a convicted felon to be president of the United States, they raised their hands. Give Ron credit, he had to look at everybody else first to see if he wanted to raise his hand, but then he raised his hand. Kind of like cheating off somebody paper in high school. They raised their hands and I did not and will not and I cannot countenance that behavior. I want you to imagine for a second that Jefferson and Hamilton and Adams and Washington and Franklin were sitting here tonight. Do you think they could imagine that the country they risked their lives to create would actually be having a conversation about whether a convicted criminal should be president of the United States? I can't tell you how many people in New Hampshire have asked me why isn't there a law against that? The answer is because nobody ever thought that someone would have the audacity to run for president as a criminal and they never thought that any American electorate would actually support it. It's not their fault that they didn't put it in the Constitution, along with 35 years old and a natural born American citizen. They didn't think, let's throw in here and not a criminal, they thought maybe we'd get that part. We're going to show them now whether we do or we don't in the next ten months. Do we get it or don't we? I'm out here saying what I've been saying for the last eight months because I didn't want to take the chance that you might not get it. I want it to be the voice that was telling you. This is unacceptable. We deserve better. And now there's some people who want the courts to save us. It's not up to the courts to save us. I remember what Benjamin Franklin said. I'm sure many of you do, too. When he was walking down the street in Philadelphia after the Constitutional Convention, a woman approached him on the street and said, Mr. Franklin, what kind of government did you give us and he said to the woman, ""A republic, if you can keep it."" Benjamin Franklin's words were never more relevant in America than they are right now. The last time they were this relevant was the Civil War. Which of course, we know was caused by slavery. The last time those words were that relevant back in those days and now we are confronted 160 years later, with that question again. A republic, if we can keep it. It's up to you. I've been running ads all over New Hampshire, ending it saying, it's up to you and it is. It's not up to me, I've done everything I can and it's not about me. The other candidates, some of them have made it about them. It's okay, but when you forget that the privilege to serve in public office is not about you, but about the people who give you the privilege, then you lose your way. And so tonight is a sad night for me and for Mary Pat, because, believe it or not, we really love the people in the state. We loved being here. Both of our experiences in 2016 and 2024 in coming to New Hampshire and holding two hour town hall meetings and answering every question has been one of the great joys and honors of our lives. The relationships we've made here have been lifelong relationships now that we're going to keep going forward, no matter what else we do with our lives and our careers. I look around this room and see so many people who have been to so many of these meetings and have been so wonderfully supportive of us. I'd start to name names, but then I'd screw that up and I'd forget somebody who was really important to us, so I'm not going to do that. You know who you are. And you know how much we treasure our relationships with you. But I will mention one person, because she texted me either last night or this morning and she said to me, please, please don't drop out. We need you. And that was our friend Toni Pappas. And because I had decided at that moment in my heart, and so had Mary Pat, that we were going to I didn't respond to you because I didn't want to lie to you. But I turned to Mary Pat and I handed her the phone and showed her and I said, these are the kind of people that were fighting for. The people who believe that what we have to offer is something important and special, and that what we're talking about matters. And it meant a lot to me to get that text from you, Toni, because I know that you've been through a lot of campaigns here in this state and to hear from you that you wanted me to stay, made me feel guilty, but also made me feel wonderful. And you know, both those feelings can exist at the same time. And I thank you for that and I pointed out that Toni is represented by a lot of people in this room who we've heard from over the last few weeks and we appreciate it very much. We appreciate your friendship, your hospitality, your warmth, your questions, your challenges and everything that you provided to us in this state both eight years ago and over the last eight months. I'll just end with this. I believe and have always believed that this is the greatest country that the world has ever seen and I still believe that today. The phrase Make America Great Again has always offended me, because it implied that America wasn't great. America is great, it was great long before those red hats showed up and it will be great long after they are consigned to history. This country is a great country and the only thing that stops us from having it be greater is our willingness to work hard enough to make it greater. It is not easy to stand up and fight for what we believe in when the wind is blowing in our face. It is not easy to stand up and fight the loudest voice in the room. It isn't easy to look at someone who we know is unfit and unable to represent what the heart of this country really is and tell them, thank you for your service, it's time for you to go home. But, that's what we need to do in the next ten months if we are going to keep in concert with the spirit of this country. I don't know how anybody could want to be in the United States if they don't love America and you cannot love America if you don't love every American. Love the Americans who look different than you. Love the Americans who speak different than you. Love the Americans who think different than you, love the Americans who believe and have faith that is different than yours. We have had Donald Trump and other candidates in this race say they don't want people coming to this country if they're not of our religion. We don't have a religion in America. Our Constitution is founded on there being no national religion. Yet we're abandoning that to by continuing to respond positively to the siren song of someone who would actually say something like that as a candidate for president, the United States met to only divide. If we don't stand for those principles, we will be the generation that gave this country away. I refuse. When I got into this race, I refused and tonight, even though I'm suspending this campaign. I am not going away and my voice is not going away. And I am going to continue to say all the things that I've said and what other platforms, whatever platforms are permitted to me as we go forward, the very same things and new things that I'm sure I will have the opportunity to comment on as we go forward. Because I'm not going to be part of the generation that gives this country away. I am not going to be part of a generation who willingly stands by and says it's too hard, he's too loud, he's too strong. That's what defeat looks and sounds like. And the only country that can defeat America is America. And the only people that can stop it are us. So I thank you for the enormous honor. To have the chance to run for president of the United States again. I thank you for your time to listen to what I've had to say and to give it thought and consideration. I thank you for the opportunity to come into your homes, into your neighborhoods, into your schools, into your churches and to be able to make the case for the kind of America that I hope we have. And I thank you most of all for your attendance at these events and your questions for continuing to renew my faith in America and Americans. I love this country because my heart is open to every American. And every person who cares about making this a better place. And so while I'm disappointed by the results of this election, I will never be disappointed by the opportunity and experience that I've had. And I promise you that in whatever way Mary Pat and I can figure out, we are going to continue the fight for you and for this country in a way that will make you proud that we met, because I'm proud to have met all of you through this process. So thank you for coming tonight and thank you for all your support. I appreciate it very much.","","",""

As governor, she brought tens of thousands of jobs to South Carolina by partnering with businesses, and she will do the same for America. Ron DeSantis didn't bat an eye when Disney engaged in woke shenanigans for years. In fact, he happily gave Disney the largest subsidy in Florida history! When Disney suddenly criticized the governor, DeSantis launched a public vendetta that is costing Florida taxpayers millions of dollars. NIKKI HALEY Nikki Haley said Ron DeSantis' bill banning talk of gender up to the third grade didn't go far enough and called for leaving discussions about sex and gender to parents. Coincidentally, DeSantis later expanded his original bill to do just that. Haley was dubbed a ""Jobs Governor"" who created tens of thousands of new jobs in all of South Carolina's 46 counties. Haley cut the unemployment rate more than in half, from 11% to 4%. RON DeSANTIS Disney has been woke for years and Ron DeSantis didn't say a peep.

DeSantis carved out an exception for Disney in his bill cracking down on social media companies in 2021.

In her latest attempt to win approval from the Beltway media, Haley expressed support for resettling Gaza refugees in American communities, then walked back her statement after she realized it was politically unpopular. Make no mistake, Nikki Haley is as soft on illegal — and legal — immigration as every other establishment politician that caves to the left.

It's not surprising that Haley's views on immigration are out of step with the GOP electorate. She always caves to her liberal donors, who support the open borders agenda.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/369829",4791,"Ron DeSantis' call for energy independence on ""Day One"" of his administration is laughable given his long record of opposing offshore drilling and fracking. DeSantis supported fracking and drilling bans as a gubernatorial candidate, and on Day Two of his administration, he signed legislation banning offshore drilling and fracking. Watch the video evidence here. Nikki Haley has a long record of promoting American energy independence. As governor, she supported offshore drilling and went after the Obama administration's heavy-handed regulations. At the UN, she defended U.S. sovereignty on energy. And she has a comprehensive plan to unleash American energy as president and roll back Joe Biden's harmful green energy mandates and subsidies that make us more dependent on China. RON DeSANTIS ON ENERGY DeSantis' call for energy dominance is a farce considering he has long opposed offshore drilling and fracking. As a candidate for governor, he called on the Trump administration to drop plans for drilling in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. He promised to ban fracking and drilling on his gubernatorial campaign website. On his second day in office as governor, DeSantis issued executive orders banning fracking and offshore drilling in Florida. He was praised by the Sierra Club. DeSantis now says he supported the drilling and fracking bans because Florida voters passed a constitutional amendment banning drilling, but he supported those bans before the amendment passed. In addition, the voter ban did not include fracking, which he also opposed. Breitbart: Claim: Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley claimed fellow Republican presidential candidate Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) banned fracking in Florida during Wednesday's second GOP primary debate. Verdict: TRUE. As governor, DeSantis campaigned on and implemented a ban on fracking in Florida's waters. DeSantis' energy record mirrors Joe Biden's.  Like Biden's Climate Resilience program, DeSantis' Resilient Florida program would allow Democrat-run cities to apply for taxpayer funding to deal with the effects of climate change. DeSantis used Biden's American Rescue Plan to enact his climate agenda. DeSantis proposed using an additional $1 billion from Biden's $1.9 trillion federal stimulus package to fund his resiliency program. DeSantis announced an additional $404 million for climate change expenses, the largest funding for climate preparation in state history, funded by Biden's American Rescue Plan. Criticism Tampa Bay Times: DeSantis supports offshore drilling and fracking, just not in Florida Washington Examiner: DeFlorida blueprint: How DeSantis has pursued a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist image  NIKKI HALEY Haley toured an oil rig in Texas in the spring and unveiled her American energy plan. Stop the demonization of the oil and gas industries, and empower American producers to produce more at home. Speed up permitting and building of interstate pipelines and make sure the EPA and radical environmental groups do not stop new energy projects. Roll back Biden's wasteful green energy subsidies and regulations that make America more dependent on China. Stand up to energy-rich dictators in Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. Haley has a record of fighting against government regulation and promoting an all-of-the-above energy policy. Haley was and continues to be an advocate for harnessing offshore energy. Under Haley, South Carolina challenged Obama's Clean Power Plan in federal court. Haley issued an order to stop all work on the Clean Power Plan in South Carolina after the Supreme Court halted it. In 2013, South Carolina and 11 other states sued the EPA over compliance with FOIA requests related to a haze requirement in the Clean Air Act. As ambassador, Haley supported President Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord, calling it a flawed agreement that placed too heavy a burden on American jobs. As ambassador, Haley stood up for America on the world stage and opposed the Global Pact for the Environment — a proposal to bring international environmental law under one legally binding treaty at the UN.

So she can swoop in here and try to do that. But what she did was wrong.  Here's the issue. We have a lot of challenges and national security. One is our own southern border. And you have people like Nikki Haley that care more about the Ukraine border than she does about our own border here in the United States. How can you be a sovereign country and let in 8 million people from all over the world, including people that are affiliated with terrorist groups, and we know that and yet send another 100 billion dollars out of the $200 billion that they've sent out overseas while ignoring problems at home.  Second, the number one threat to this country in terms of foreign is China, China, Biden is not doing anything to deter China. My posture is, Commander in Chief, and I'm the only one that served in the military. And I'll be the first president elected since 1980. It's actually served in a foreign war. And I'm a Navy guy, and we need more naval power in the Indo Pacific to be able to deter China's ambitions not just for Taiwan. But getting out of the first island chain, we're the only ones that are going to be able to have the hard power to deter them. Now, if I could snap my finger, I give all of that territory back to Ukraine. Russia had no right. They had no right to go into Crimea in 2014, or Donbass. And what they've done now is wrong. At the same time, they're sending your money to do things like pay salaries for Ukrainian bureaucrats. They're paying pensions for retired Ukrainian government workers. Is that America's role to be doing that? I don't think so. Now, in a military perspective, I'm going to be a good ally to those who are allied with us. And so those European countries, you know, they're good allies of ours, but they're not pulling their fair share. They're not pulling their weight. With respect to NATO, you only have a third of the countries that are meeting their obligations of 2% or more GDP. So I think we need to have an end game two to stop this. I think we need to work with the Europeans for them to do more. I am willing to work with them, because we have military relationships to help to do that. But we can't just have a blank check.

You have my vote Monday. Thank you. The left has weaponized the FBI, DOJ and the IRS against their political enemies, including President Trump. When you're president, will there be a reckoning for the distribution power?  DESANTIS: Scott, thank you for the question. That's an easy answer. Yes.  And we're going to do it on day one. We're going to be ready to go. Because here's the thing. Those agencies have become weaponized. I mean, you look at what they've done. I mean, I first saw it when I first ran for Congress. I had groups in my district where the IRS was targeting those conservative groups back there in 2012, and it's like a small nonprofit that just talking about the Constitution. Under Obama, they did it, and no one was held accountable for doing that. Then you had the Russia collusion, where they went after President Trump false theory about stealing the '16 election. They kneecapped him any way they could. Nobody was held accountable for that. So you're going to keep getting these outcomes until you have a president that comes in and drops the hammer.  Our founding fathers understood that if power is allowed to accumulate, human nature being what it is, it is going to be abused. They assume that the elected president would not let it happen. Honestly, they also assume that Congress would use its power of the purse to rein in these rogue agencies. And Congress doesn't do that. They put the government on autopilot with these continuing resolutions and these omnibus bills. So they have defaulted on their responsibility to do it in Congress, but I will do it as president. What does that look like? On day one, you'll have a new director of the FBI, you're going to have new people in the Department of Justice. I'm going to take parts of those agencies, I'm going to move them out of DC. I disagree with Donald Trump, who wants to build a massive new FBI headquarters over a billion dollars in Washington DC. That doesn't drain the swamp, that deepens the swamp. I'm taking that out of Washington, DC, we're going to take power out of there. But here's the thing. Those are not independent agencies. There's a canard in Washington that the beltway press will say, Oh, the President can't be involved in the Department of Justice. That's politicizing it. No, if they're independent of who the elected president is, that means they're unaccountable. You don't want unaccountable power for people who can put you in jail and people that have guns, they need to be able to kind of go so if an FBI agent is going after parents going to school board meeting, I'm firing those people if the FBI is colluding with big tech to censor dissent in this country. I'm firing those people. If the FBI is passing around memos saying observant Catholics are potential terrorists. I'm firing those people. So there's going to be a reckoning and not just for those agencies. There's going to be a reckoning for the agencies that plunged this country into lockdown during COVID, Anthony Fauci, CDC, NIH, all those agencies FDA, you're going to see major accountability, because if we want to change the way this government operates, you've got to hold the people accountable who are responsible for the madness, and I will do that.""

I'm running for your issues, your family's issues, and to turn this country around. And that's my sole focus.  And I think you can see an indication of who represents the biggest threat to the current order of things in Washington, because we need a change agent in Washington, rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic and going to work. They have spent more money attacking me than all the other Republicans have faced combined. They've spent more money attacking me than Biden and Trump combined in this election cycle. The media, I mean, who does the media not want to be the candidate? Me. They're after me all the time. But you know, I view that for Republican voters, that should be an endorsement of me, if the media doesn't want me if they're trying to do everything they can to stop me, well, I must be doing something right. And I must be a good candidate for you. So I wear that as a badge of honor.  I think what you're seeing us do in Iowa, is do it the old fashioned way. You're lining up people who are committing to caucus for you. We have massive numbers of people. I think we have more commits than anyone's ever had. And then Iowa caucus, we have all the counties organized. People that have been involved in this process, say it's the best yet. That's not something that necessarily is a poll or not, because a poll is based on who's going to turn out and who's not our people are turning out. And so for those who are supporting us, thank you. Anyone who's done decided, I'm the guy that will get this done for this country. You know, one of the things that I like in Florida is people will come up to me who didn't vote for me in the primary when I ran for governor in 2018. And they'll say, Yeah, I didn't vote for you, man. That was the worst vote I ever did. Like, you've done a great job. I couldn't be happier and even some people that voted for me in the primary would say, you know, I really liked you. I thought you'd be a good governor. You did so much better than even I could have imagined so isn't a time instead of having people over promise and under deliver that you have somebody that makes bold promises and over delivers on those promises? Let's stop under delivering."" Watch HERE.","","",""

DES MOINES, Iowa – After tonight's Fox News Town Hall, Ron DeSantis took questions from members of the press alongside Iowa faith leader Bob Vander Plaats and Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX). Highlights are below. Watch the full press conference HERE. On how New York cares more about illegal immigrants than their own students:  I think it's disgraceful. I mean, just think about it. You're appearing in the Bronx. Was it Brooklyn? Brooklyn...you probably have a lot of single moms who are the breadwinner, so they got to work during the day. Your kids are supposed to go to school, and then someone tells you 'Sorry, your kids have to stay home.' Why? Was there some type of real significant storm or some emergency? Was there a flu outbreak? Well, why are they having to stay home? They're having to stay at home because the state government is commandeering, or the city government is commandeering the school to house illegal aliens. You talk about putting Americans last-- you're depriving these kids an in person education to be able to house people that don't have a right to be here to begin with? That's Joe Biden's America in a nutshell. So I think it's disgraceful that that's happening. But I think this. You know, when I'm President, this immigration stuff, we're building a big consensus in this country, consensus in New York City--these are very liberal voters, usually. But they are, almost all of them, saying this can't go on like this. You can't just have schools overtaken, hospitals overrun. People are coming in, we don't even know who they are. So far, this has been one of Biden's probably the biggest failures simply because he has more control over this. There's certain things the President may not have direct control over. He is causing this. He could stop it. And he's choosing not to stop.  On Donald Trump's comment that he wants the economy to crash:  I don't want the economy to crash because people's livelihoods depend on their 401k's.People's jobs—If the economy crashes, people get thrown out of work, businesses would go under, I don't want to see that happening. I want people to do well, that's what we've done. You know, our economy is performing better than any other state in the country. Our unemployment rate is 60% less than California, for example. 40% less than New York. We now have more manufacturing jobs than the state of New York because we have more people employed in New York for the first time in history. And people wouldn't expect that given we've got a lot of retirees in the state of Florida. This is very important for people's lives. They're working hard and they're not able to get ahead. They're working hard. They're doing everything right and they're falling further and further behind. We want to lift people up, we want to give them an opportunity that hard work will pay off, that nothing's going to be handed to you. But if you're grinding, you're making the most of your God-give ability in America, you can do better. So I want people to do well. I don't want to see people's retirements flushed away, I don't want to see people's businesses fail. I want to see people succeed. And we have reached our potential in this country. Florida shows when we talk a lot of the trends, I think we're doing much better.  On why he is the most electable candidate, not Nikki Haley:  You don't win as a Republican when you don't stand for anything. You got to have core convictions, you got to go in bold colors, not failed tests. So that's how you get the people to turn out for you that you need to be able to win. I noticed, you know, we have we have identified her [Nikki Haley] saying that her inspiration to run for office was Hillary Clinton. She's now going around saying that that's a lie. She wrote that in her book. She said that she had seen Hillary, that inspired her to run for office and make her voice heard. And so she basically doesn't want to deal with the record. And she just said, 'You're lying. You're lying' when literally, she's saying that on video and writing in the book. And so I think that she is kowtowing to folks that are not going to inspire our voters to come out in sufficient numbers to be able to match the Democrats... it's like every day she answers questions, something happens where she's putting her foot in her mouth. We all remember about Republican candidates who are elevated by the media in the primary, how that ends up working out in the general election. Because the minute it would be Republican versus a Democrat, it's all going to be against her. Republican voters know that. I think she's shown she just can't handle the scrutiny and can't defend her record. That's why she rarely answers questions. I guess she's not even answering voter's questions anymore.","","",""

You know, they said that they were going to change the way Washington operates, they said that they were going to hold these agencies accountable...the House of Representatives is supposed to, because they're armed with the power of the purse, be the people's redress for when government misbehaves, when government violates people's rights, when the government doesn't do its core functions like it's failing to do at the border. If you're willing to just simply fund the whole thing into perpetuity, then you're never going to get any of those practices changed. And so he says, oh, well, we're really concerned about a, quote, government shutdown. Well, what's going on now with the status quo is shutting down our country. It's shutting down the American dream. It's shutting down our sovereignty. Why would you want to just green light the current order things given how bad all this is? But you know, this has been standard practice, I think, for Republicans for a long time. What you really just need is leadership. I mean, I think Trump, when he was president, he had an opportunity to change some of this. It just wasn't anything he wanted to fight on. I mean, he signed a massive spending bill, I think his first or second year in office, and he pledged he would never do it again. And yet he did it, I think a half a dozen times again, culminating in Cares Act one and two, which added another $4 trillion to the debt just in his last year in office. But I think if you have a president that lays down the marker, that's going to galvanize Republican voters and a lot of independent voters around the country, and then that puts pressure on these guys to actually do what they say they're going to do.  On the countdown to the Iowa Caucuses:  I think we have the momentum. I think we're doing very well. You know, we've got tens of thousands of people that are already committed to caucus for us. We have the precincts organized, where I think 15-almost 1600 precinct captains that are going to be there, all the things you need to do to be able to maximize your vote on the Iowa caucus.And if you put a side by side between him [Trump] in 2016 riffing and really at the top of his game versus now in 2024, I mean, it's just a different guy that you're seeing there. Obviously, he's taking positions, like building a new FBI headquarters in DC that's going to cost a billion dollars-plus, he's waffled on gender ideology, and even attacked pro-life legislation. So I think it's a different candidate than the one he was in 2016. So as we come down the stretch, Iowans are going to be able to make a decision. Donald Trump's running for his issues. Nikki Haley's running for her donors' issues. I'm the one really running for your issues and your family's issues and just the sole focus on being a very disciplined, focused president to turn this country around. Of all the candidates running, I'm most in tune with the values of the Iowa Republicans that are going to go and vote on the Iowa caucus. And so I think that that's a good position to be in.  On the issues that are important to Iowas: I definitely think the border. No matter where in Iowa I was, people are very concerned. I mean, our country has over 8 million people that are coming into this country, massive numbers. We don't know who they are. They're coming from all across the world. It's causing huge problems, of course, but then the prospect of terrorist attacks and other types of criminal activity is looming large in voters' minds. I saw that increase after the Israel attack, Israel got attacked on October 7, because I think people are just intuitively like oh wait, Israel's got the best border security in the world, and yet they got viciously attacked. Are we led to believe that an open border of the United States, that our enemies are not taking advantage of this? Of course they are. And so I think it kind of, it's countered the media thinking the only people that care about the border are people in border towns. And I went on a ride along in Wayne County, Iowa, and you see how the cartels and the illegal immigration has affected a rural county in Iowa. So every community's become a border community. And I think Iowans what somebody that's finally going to bring this issue to an end. You know, Donald Trump obviously promised to build the wall and have record deportations, and that didn't happen. We don't have an opportunity. We're not going to get a mulligan on this one. I mean, we're either going to restore this country's sovereignty now, or it may never happen.","","",""

The 30-second spot also features DeSantis' closing message in the Hawkeye State, ""Donald Trump is running for his issues. Nikki Haley's running for her donors' issues. I'm running for your issues."" Part of the campaign's previously announced ad buy in Iowa through Caucus Day, ""Iowa Insults vs Iowa Values"" will air on broadcast and cable television in the Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and Davenport media markets. Haley insulted Iowans at an event in New Hampshire last week. Days later, she was booed for her comments by a crowd of Iowa caucus goers at a CNN town hall in Des Moines. Her gaffe was plastered across local newscasts in Iowa  and the fallout continues to accelerate a week out from Caucus Day, as Iowans, pundits, and the press corps start to realize Haley just isn't ready to handle the scrutiny that comes with competing at this level. Haley's insult to Iowans paints a stark contrast with her and DeSantis, who shares Iowa values of faith, family, and freedom, has the support of key Iowa conservatives like Kim Reynolds and Bob Vanderplaats, and has visited all 99 counties in the Hawkeye State. Watch the TV ad HERE. TRANSCRIPT: NARRATOR: Here's what Wall Street funded Nikki Haley just said in New Hampshire:  HALEY: You know Iowa starts it. You know that you correct it.  NARRATOR: Haley disparages the caucuses and insults you.  HALEY: You know Iowa starts it. You know that you correct it.

""This is clearly a two-person race between Trump's debunked lies and Nikki's vision for a strong and proud America."" LIE: Haley opposed Trump's border wall. TRUTH: Haley supports building a border wall. She opposed building ""just"" a wall exclusively, arguing that we need a comprehensive approach that includes drones, planes, border agents, infrastructure, and more. Haley's full comments: ""What does that mean to you in terms of your commitment to work with Congress to actually secure the border? Don't say you're just going to build a wall. Because a wall is not going to do it. You've got to have commitment of ground troops, equipment, money, all of that to bring it together. Then you're being serious about tackling illegal immigration."" (National Press Club, ~44:53, 9/02/15) LIE: Haley opposed Trump's travel ban. TRUTH: Haley supported banning travel for people from countries with serious terrorist activity, but opposed religious tests. Trump himself dropped his support for a Muslim ban that was widely panned as unconstitutional in favor of a travel ban from countries posing a national security risk. The Supreme Court upheld the third version of Trump's ban specifically because ""the text says nothing about religion."" Haley defended Trump's revised travel ban as UN Ambassador multiple times because it targeted geographic areas with serious terrorist activity and not religious countries or individuals. LIE: Haley doesn't think illegal aliens are law-breakers. TRUTH: Haley has always opposed illegal immigration and talked about being a country of law and order. In 2011, she passed one of the toughest anti-illegal immigration laws in the country and spoke passionately about America being a country of laws. The 2015 comments reflect Haley's belief that not every illegal immigrant is a hardened criminal, but they still have to follow the law. Haley's 2015 comments: ""I think that what we have to remember, and I have always believed, is that we are a country of laws, that's what makes us strong. We have to always be a country of laws. So it's incredibly frustrating for a lot of people when they see the illegal immigrants being able to come across. It really is astonishing that after all of these years, D.C. hasn't figured out how to build a wall. It really is, after all of what they spend."" LIE: Haley supports amnesty. TRUTH: Haley has never supported amnesty and there is no evidence to support this claim.","","",""

And her response was that she never said that. That is a lie. She wrote that in her book.""  DES MOINES, Iowa – Ron DeSantis was joined by Congressmen Chip Roy and Thomas Massie to speak with hundreds of fired up Iowa caucusgoers at McDivot's Indoor Sports Pub in Grimes, Iowa this afternoon. After talking about why he is the best candidate to take on Joe Biden and reverse the decline of our country, DeSantis took questions from attendees. Keep reading for the highlights and watch the full event here. On how he will defund the UN:  I will defund the United Nations. You should not be funding the United Nations. Absolutely. I mean, honestly, it's a total farce of an organization, the anti-semitism, anti-Israel. It's like a rogue's gallery, you ever ran on the Human Rights Council? And you know, just like the way I view it is, it's your tax dollars. It's not the government's money. I mean, like the Democrats will say like, oh my gosh, you know, Biden gave you this or that. And I'm like, no, no, it's not his money. It's your money. So can I justify going up to a truck driver and saying, 'Hey, We need you to pay taxes so that I can send to the United Nations?' No, I could not do that. And that's a contrast in this race because Trump funded it gladly for years, and Haley was in the United Nations and justified funding the United Nations when she was testifying in Congress, under oath. I've never had any use for it. And we will absolutely defund the United Nations.  On Nikki Haley's string of recent gaffes and lies about her past: [Haley] says that Iowa's votes need to be corrected, and all this other stuff. It's just ridiculous. But she was asked yesterday why she said Hillary Clinton was an inspiration to her. And her response was that she never said that. That is a lie. She wrote that in her book. And she's told the story, she's on video doing this. And it's like, okay, you are inspired to run for office, not by Ronald Reagan. Not by Margaret Thatcher, but by Hillary Clinton. Just own it. You have video, yes, is on tape and everything, to tell Iowans that she'd never said that, when that's just factually false. You know, that should show you, are you somebody, a candidate that's coming here saying things, then you change your personality to go in the next state? And then keep doing that? Or like Popeye, I can say I am what I am, like, I'm going to tell you, it's great. And I don't have to make all those adjustments. I don't have to do any of that stuff. So that's one thing. On how he will keep his campaign promises as President, unlike Trump:  The former president, you know, he's running on saying that he's going to do an executive order on birthright citizenship. And I don't think people that come illegally are entitled to birthright citizenship. So I think that needs to be done. But he ran in 2016 saying the exact same thing. So he got in, he had four years, all he had to do was sign an executive order, it would have taken 30 seconds. He could have sat down, gotten it, signed it, done. Four years, never signed the executive order on birthright citizenship. So now he's running, saying he's going to do what he could have done the first four years. And you've got to ask yourself: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me on this. And so he had a chance to do it. He didn't get the job done. You can't have any assurance that he would actually follow through even if he could get elected going forward. On the campaign's grassroots momentum in Iowa:  Now's the time to be active. Now's the time where you guys can make a difference. Not just I mean, obviously, I'm the candidate, but I'm just a vessel for all this. I mean, it's really a movement to change the trajectory of this country, and to restore the greatness of America. So we have it within our power to do it. So if you've committed for us, bring a bunch of people. I hope the rest of you will commit to us today. We've got ways you can sign up and do the whole nine yards. And I hope you'll bring a lot of people you know. It's going to be very, very cold. So these are really committed caucus goers who really are passionate about fixing this country and I know that is likely most of the people in this room.  On being prepared for ""the long battle"" ahead:  I've said, I've put a lot of time in here because I think it's important, and I think that Iowa gives you an opportunity to be on the ground and get underneath all the media chatter and just talk to people face to face, and Iowans appreciate that. But anybody saying somehow, like, we're only doing Iowa, that's just a flat out lie. You know, you have to be built for the long haul. You know, we've got a great organization in these other early states. You know, you have some candidates like Haley, she didn't even get on the ballot in Nevada for the caucus there. And so we're definitely doing that. I think, you know, there's always these things they tried to do in caucuses where they tried to plant this rumor, all that stuff. I think Iowans know that that's just typical scuttlebutt, that that's not -- they're going to try to, Trump will do whatever he can. So as caucus night, they'll try to make something up. But make no mistake, you know, we've got a mission. And we've got to complete this mission. It's a long process. It's an arduous process. I think Iowa is going to be a great way for us to start the process, but we certainly have a lot of road after that. And, you know, we're girded for that long battle.","","",""

I'm more reflective of the conservative values that you see here in Iowa.""  DES MOINES, Iowa – Ron DeSantis today joined Cavuto Live on Fox News Channel. The highlights are below. Watch part one HERE and part two HERE.On his ground game and organization ahead of the Iowa Caucuses:  You got to win a majority of the delegates. I mean, you know this is a lengthy, dynamic process. I actually like when people try to count me out in the underdog. That gives us a great opportunity to really put points on the board and surprise some people. But look, we've done it right here. We've gone to all 99 counties, we visited folks, we go and take questions from voters every single day. I show up to town halls on TV. We're going to do one with Fox next week, we show up to debates. We do all this stuff, and that's how you got to do it to do well in the Iowa caucus. And I think you know that this is not like a normal primary election where you just punch your ticket and go home. You know, this is a commitment. It's going to be probably very cold weather. We've got snow -- I'm in Dubuque right now, there's snow on the ground, much different from what we've got in Florida, and it's probably going to be even a lot colder then. People are going to come. So we've got an army of committed people that are going to go. We're adding more every day, we've got great organization, and this is traditionally the way you got to do it. So I'm proud of all the effort that we have. And I'm proud that we're going to be able to bring this to great fruition here very shortly.  On why he's the best candidate for Iowans:  The way I view the primary is this: Donald Trump's running for his issues, Nikki Haley's running for her donors' issues, I'm running for your issues, your family's issues, and the issues that are affecting his country. That's my sole focus. And I have a record to back that up of delivering on 100% of my promises in the state of Florida and taking on the left and beating the left. No other one running has done. I mean, just now, I think you guys saw some of the reports about the teacher union because of the reforms we did in Florida to say you can't do automatic deduction of union dues. Now, because we've empowered teachers, a lot of them aren't joining. And the Dade County teacher union, third largest in the country, is on the brink of decertification. When has a Republican ever fought and won against them. We beat Soros, we beat Fauci, we've done all this. So that's, I think, what really separates us. I'm more reflective of the conservative values that you see here in Iowa. I know the other two candidates, and particularly somebody like Nikki Haley, you know, she was in New Hampshire saying that Iowa's votes need to be corrected by other states. That has gone over like a lead balloon here in the state of Iowa. I can tell you that. And you know, Donald Trump has not been willing to answer questions. He doesn't do the type of meet and greets and town halls that are a staple here. He hasn't been willing to participate in any debates. In fact, you know, we did have a debate. We have a debate scheduled, I accepted, Haley accepted, he declined, and then he scheduled a town hall on Fox News Channel where he could have easily debated. So there's a contrast here. And I think that, ultimately, we're the ones that's going to have earned the votes.  On how Nikki Haley is running to be Trump's VP:  I want to make an impact, Neil. I'm in office to be able to deliver results to people, and to take a position where you're not going to be able to deliver results for anyone, that just doesn't appeal to me. I do think, though, it's interesting. She refuses to rule out whether she would be Donald Trump's running mate if Trump were to be the nominee. And that's, I think, important because she's really catered to a lot of Democrat donors, Democrat-leaning voters, a lot of people that are basically very anti-Trump and have actually donated a lot of money in the past to oppose Donald Trump. And so they're viewing her as the vessel to be an anti-Trumper. And yet, she will not roll this out. So the question is, why can't she just give a straight answer? Either yes, you would accept, or no, you would not. And instead, we get the typical politician speak.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/369761",5712,"CHARLESTON, S.C. — No wonder Donald Trump is afraid to debate Nikki Haley. His $4.5 million TV ads have been denounced by fact checkers as false. The first ad on taxes was deemed false here, here, here, and here. Trump's latest ad on immigration is a complete fabrication that reveals Haley's surging momentum and the Trump campaign's desperation. ""No wonder Donald Trump is afraid to debate Nikki Haley,"" said Haley communications director Nachama Soloveichik. ""Every one of his attacks against Haley has been proven false. Trump should spend more time explaining why he never fulfilled his signature promise to build a wall instead of desperately trying to mislead voters with easily debunked ads.""  Donald Trump ad wrongly describes Nikki Haley's position on a border wall, travel ban By: Maria Briceño and Maria Ramirez UribeOnline here As the New Hampshire primary nears, polls show former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley closing the gap between her and President Donald Trump, her rival for the Republican presidential nomination. Perhaps feeling the pressure, Trump, the GOP front-runner, is airing an ad in New Hampshire that casts him as a strong defender of U.S. borders while portraying Haley as weak. Ominous music plays as the 30-second ad shows footage of large groups of migrants heading to the border, and families in mourning as a narrator mentions fentanyl deaths. ""Yet Haley and Biden oppose Trump's border wall,"" the narrator said. ""Confirmed warnings of terrorists sneaking in through our southern border. Yet Haley joined Biden in opposing Trump's visitor ban from terrorist nations. ""Haley's weakness puts us in grave danger. Trump's strength protects us."" Text on the screen also said: ""Haley opposed Trump's border wall"" and ""Haley opposed Trump's travel ban."" The claims about Haley's positions are wrong. Haley said more was needed to secure the border, but she didn't oppose Trump's border wall. She opposed a Muslim travel ban, but supported other iterations of Trump's travel bans. Haley supported a border wall among other security measures On the border wall portion, the Trump ad cites a February 2023 Time article about Haley's flip-flops around her former boss. The article linked to a 2015 Washington Post opinion piece about Haley's remarks at a National Press Club luncheon that year. Haley said that securing the border wasn't just about building a wall. ""Because a wall is not going to do it,"" she said Sept. 2, 2015. ""You've got to have commitment of ground troops, equipment, money, all of that to bring it together. Then you're being serious about tackling illegal immigration."" During an April 2023 trip to the southwest border, Haley praised border fencing she said was installed by the Trump administration, saying more of it is needed. ""It's a complete lie,"" Haley said about the Trump ad on Fox News Jan. 5. ""First of all I didn't say I opposed the border wall, I said I opposed just doing a border wall, I said that we have to do more than that."" Haley supported a ban that did not single out people for their religion As a presidential candidate in 2015, Trump called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" Haley, then South Carolina's governor, called Trump's proposal ""an embarrassment"" that ""defies everything that this country was based on."" The Trump ad cites those comments, ignoring that she supported the travel bans he issued when she was part of his administration. The U.S. Senate approved Haley's confirmation as U.N. ambassador Jan. 24, 2017. Four days later, Trump signed an executive order banning citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days. Those seven countries ""repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism,"" according to an anti-terrorism law signed by Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. PolitiFact didn't find any public comments from Haley about the executive order at the time. After court challenges, Trump revised that order to exclude Iraq. That new order also exempted U.S. legal permanent residents and people with U.S. visas. In a March 2017 NBC interview, Haley said she supported the new version. ""It's not a Muslim ban. I will never support a Muslim ban. I don't think we should ever ban anyone based on their religion,"" she said. After additional court challenges, Trump issued a third version of the travel ban, restricting U.S. entry to people from Chad, North Korea and Venezuela. The Supreme Court in June 2018 upheld this travel ban. Haley continued to defend the policy in an interview with NDTV that month, saying the executive order was ""not a Muslim ban,"" because not all Muslim-majority countries were on the list and not all countries on the list were Muslim-majority. ""This is about safety. This is about terrorism,"" Haley said. Haley's position is similar years later in this presidential campaign. In response to Trump's ad, her campaign said that she ""supported banning travel for people from countries with serious terrorist activity, but opposed religious tests."" Our ruling A Trump ad claimed that Haley ""opposed Trump's border wall"" and ""Trump's travel ban."" Haley did not oppose Trump's border wall. In 2015, she said border security required more than a border wall and that technology, infrastructure and funding were also needed. On the 2024 campaign trail, Haley has said she wants to finish building a border wall. Haley supported three versions of Trump's travel bans, saying they were focused on safety, not religion. She opposed a religion-based ban. As a presidential candidate, Haley has said she supports banning entry to people from countries with terrorist activities. We rate Trump's claims False.","","",""

The new ad features footage from DeSantis' NBC /Des Moines Register interview earlier this week when he said, ""I think it's a slap in the face to Iowans to say that they somehow need to be corrected...She is phony. She doesn't have a core set of convictions, she is coming in here, she's trying to be relatable but just doesn't get Iowa. I've gone to all 99 counties, I've spoken with people all across this state, you have people that are hardworking, God-fearing, patriotic — they represent the backbone of this country, so they don't need correcting.""  Haley's cleanup attempts this week have only poured salt on the wound for Iowans, as she said yesterday that she will ""change"" her ""personality"" after the Iowa Caucus concludes. Watch ""Slap in the Face"" HERE. Here is more of what they are saying about Haley's insult to Iowans:  Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis on KFAB : What I've heard more than anything else from Iowans -- and I've been getting out on the phones, I've been knocking on doors, I've been going around and meeting with people and doing coffees -- they do not appreciate what Nikki Haley said in New Hampshire when she said Iowa starts it and New Hampshire corrects it. Iowans do not need to be corrected. You know, Iowa embodies everything that we are fighting to protect -- faith, family, hard work, and decency. For her to say that the people of Iowa need to be corrected, I think it is extremely disrespectful. And we are so appreciative and honored that we're able to participate and go out and make the case to all the people of this state. Rep. Chip Roy on Fox & Friends: The people in Iowa, recognize that while Nikki Haley goes to New Hampshire and says, New Hampshire needs to correct Iowan people in Iowa get they get to make a decision here to set the stage for Americans? PJ Media's Matt Margolis: This week, in a joint interview with NBC News correspondent Dasha Burns and Brianne Pfannenstiel, chief politics reporter at the Des Moines Register, she botched what should have been an easy question. ""But what about Hunter Biden—the president's kid—if he were convicted? Would you pardon him?"" asked Dasha Burns. ""I mean, I'm not even going to think about that. I don't even know what they've found him guilty on yet,"" Haley replied. Now, it was a stupid question to begin, but it should have been a simple, unequivocal ""no."" But, for whatever reason, Haley gave an absurdly equivocal response. CBS News' Zak Hudak: What stood out to me from Nikki Haley was her having to backtrack earlier in the week saying in New Hampshire, that Iowa starts things off and then New Hampshire corrects it. That was her kind of saying out loud what everyone is thinking. She does not have a very good shot in Iowa... In that town hall, she was saying the reality -- that she needs still to do well in Iowa, even if she's strong in New Hampshire. If she finishes, say fourth, say Vivek Ramaswamy beats her out in Iowa, she's going to have real problems going into New Hampshire. Wall Street Journal's John McCormick: Talking about the early nomination calendar, @nikkihaley said on today's recording of @IowaPress: ""The structure of it is really pretty amazing: that Iowa starts it, you change personalities, you go into New Hampshire, and they continue it on..."" POLITICO's Daniel Lippman: We saw Nikki Haley talk about how New Hampshire corrects what Iowa does, which is not always the case and it's never a good idea to insult the first state and the intelligence of the voters there. Breitbart's Wendell Husebo: Nikki Haley Says She Will 'Change Personalities' on Campaign Trail Newsmax's Addison Smith: Haley has struggled to avoid negative criticism recently, at a CNN town hall on Thursday, for example, while trying to clean up her civil war gaffe, Haley said that she grew up with black friends. This comes just a few days after Haley made her comments that the Iowa caucuses are going to need to be corrected by the New Hampshire primary, something that DeSantis slammed on Friday as an insult to the entire state.

""Isn't that sweet of him spending so much time and money against me? You know, I think that first of all, it's a complete lie. First of all, I didn't say I opposed a border wall. I said I opposed just doing a border wall. I said that we have to do more than that. That's defunding sanctuary cities. That's putting 25,000 border patrol and ICE agents on the ground. That's making sure we go back to remain in Mexico so we don't allow anyone on U.S. soil. That's instead of catch-and-release, going to catch-and-deport. So there's no truth in that. I, as governor, passed one of the toughest illegal immigration laws in the country. And we would do that nationwide. We do a national E-verify that requires every business to prove that the people they hire are there legally. So no, there is no truth to that. But, you know, I always say that, you know, if they've got to lie to win, they don't deserve to win."" On DeSantis' desperate attacks... ""I mean, God bless him. He's getting so desperate. The fact-checkers have all told him he's wrong. He actually put in millions of dollars into a campaign saying that. I never said she was an inspiration. What I said is when I had not been in politics, and I was looking at running for office; I went to a women leadership forum, and one of the speakers was Hillary Clinton. And she said, for all the reasons people tell you not to run, those are all the reasons that you should. And so when I spoke about it, if you took it all in context, I said, I don't agree with a single thing she believes in, but this is what happened and this is how I got involved in politics. I mean, look, he's lying because he's losing. And he can do that, but people see it for what it is. I'm a conservative. I was a Tea Party candidate when I ran for governor. I was a strong conservative when I cut a billion dollars off the top at the UN when I was ambassador. They can say what they want, but at the end of the day, my record speaks for itself.

On Nikki Haley's disrespect to Iowa voters:  I think it was very disrespectful to Iowans for her to mock Iowa and say that it's up to another state to quote correct what Iowans decide. And it just shows you, I think, she has not been willing to go to all 99 counties. She has not been willing to really take the questions from Iowans in every corner of the state like we have. But it's also just the fact, I mean, I think it's an admission she recognizes that, as a liberal Republican, she is out of step with the conservative values in Iowa. For example, when she was governor, her number one achievement, so to speak, was to bring in a lot of Chinese investment into the state. She bragged about that. They were the number one state among Republican governors. Now she's trying to say she's going to be tough on China, but that was not her thing. You look at, there was just a video that came out, I think it was yesterday, showing her chastising conservatives, saying that it's wrong to call illegal aliens criminals for breaking into the country. She said it was disrespectful to illegal aliens. Well, what about disrespect to Americans for coming into the country illegally? And she was at a town hall last night, and she wasn't honest with Iowans when she said she was just kind of joking, you know, when she said that. No, she was mocking Iowans when she said the results needed to be corrected. I actually, we did a town hall or back to back town halls in Des Moines on CNN believe it or not, and so I went first and the CNN anchor that did my moderated my townhall was Kaitlan Collins. Now, Nikki Haley was in Iowa I think it was last week, and she was trying to give props to Caitlin Clark for the great basketball, but she said Kaitlan Collins, so I came out, and I gave Kaitlan Collins a Caitlin Clark Jersey shirt. And I said listen, no disrespect to Ms. Collins here, but when the game's on the line, I need a buzzer beater. I'm going with Clark over Collins.  On why he's the strongest candidate on immigration:  He [Trump] did not deport a record number of illegals. In fact, he deported less, believe it or not, than Obama did in his first term. He also said he was not going to allow birthright citizenship for illegal alien children. And yet, he didn't follow through on that. And so I'm going to get it done. Day one we're going to declare it a national emergency. I'm mobilizing resources, including the military, to stop the invasion. People that have come illegally -- we have 8 million under Biden from over 100 different countries, it's a major security threat to this country -- we're going to deport those folks. We're also going to build the wall. I'm going to fund that by charging fees on remittances that people send, workers send overseas to other places, even within our North America. We're going to do that, and that'll fund the border wall. And then we're going to hold the Mexican drug cartels accountable. They're flooding this country with fentanyl. It's poisoning our people in record numbers. Tens of thousands of deaths every single year. The cartels have killed more people with fentanyl than all the terrorist groups in the world have killed Americans over the same period of time. And yet, Biden and these people in DC, they just shrug their shoulders, and they allow the carnage to continue. We're going to designate them as foreign terrorist organizations. We're going to treat them as such, including using the US military to put down the cartel. So I mean business on day one. When I tell people, I'm going to do something, you can take it to the bank. I'm going to follow through, and I'm going to get it done. And I think, you know, Donald Trump ran on a lot of this, didn't deliver most of it. Nikki Haley, she's never really been supportive of strong borders. She opposed the border wall. She wants unlimited immigration, no limits on immigration. And then she's attacked conservatives for being disrespectful by saying it's a crime to come into this country illegally. So I'm the only guy that you can trust to actually get the job done.  On his day one priorities as president:  Number one, the border. National emergency, like I mentioned before. Mobilize the resources, stop the invasion. Two, reverse all of Bidenomics, make sure that we get the economy going in a way that is not going to be beset with high prices and high inflation. Three, open up all American energy for production. We need to be energy dominant. I'm going to reverse the Green New Deal, reverse things like electric vehicle mandates, so that the American people have an opportunity to have a standard automobile and the things that we've used to take for granted. We're also going to rein in the administrative state. So day one will be the beginning of bringing this bureaucracy back in line with what the Constitution envision and the founding fathers envisioned, and restoring the government back to its rightful owners, which is we the American people. We do not have four branches of government under our Constitution, yet we've had this massive administrative state, this deep state, that has grown over many decades. You need a strong and disciplined president to reel that in. It's not going to be easy, but that will absolutely begin on day one. And then the fifth thing I would do, I'm the only veteran running for President, I'll be the first president elected since 1988 that has served in a foreign war. I recognize the recruiting crisis in the military, and I recognize how the military has become politicized with woke ideology and social experimentation. I'm going to rip all of that out on day one and restore the military to focusing on mission first.  On how he will combat communist China:  There's three things that we need to do with China. I mean, overall, just recognize China's our top national security threat. That's not what the people in DC think. That's not what even a lot of my competitors think. But they're the only peer competitor that we face. And so one, you need more hard military power in the Indo-Pacific to deter China from realizing its ambitions, not just with Taiwan, but even beyond that first island chain so that they can dominate international commerce in the Pacific, which is going to be the most important economic region over the next 50 years. Second, economic, we are dependent on China for things that are important for our economy. It should have never come to this. So we need to regain our economic independence. We need to re-shore particularly these key industries that our elites have allowed to go over to China. So we're going to build a bigger, better manufacturing base in this country. And we're going to make sure that we're not dependent on China, particularly for mission critical items for national survival. And then finally, we're going to stop Chinese influence here at home. In Florida, I signed legislation banning China from purchasing land. I don't want them buying farmland anywhere in the United States, I don't want them buying land near military bases, none of that. We've kick China out of our universities, these Confucius Institutes. I don't think that they should be involved in any American university. So we're going to curb their influence here to the United States.","","",""

The ad will run statewide on broadcast TV, cable, and digital platforms. Read more about the ad in Politico Playbook. Bolduc is a retired U.S. Army Brigadier General who served 10 tours in Afghanistan and is a proud conservative. He endorsed Nikki Haley last February, just after she entered the presidential campaign. ""General Bolduc is an American hero who served our country above and beyond the call of duty,"" Haley spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said. ""Nikki is winning over Granite State voters of all sorts, from former Trump supporters to grassroots Republicans to Independents. That's the winning formula for beating Joe Biden in a landslide, which is what all the polls show she will do.""   Transcript:  BOLDUC: I'm General Don Bolduc. Look, I'm MAGA all the way.

Iowa drives America's food production, exports over $17 billion worth of goods annually, and supplies over 300,000 jobs in my home state. Iowa keeps America afloat, and I want a president who will fight for businesses not just on the campaign trail, but in the Oval Office. The leader I am confident will stand up for us is Nikki Haley. As governor of South Carolina, Haley understood that her businesses and manufacturers were her partners. She empowered them by cutting red tape and relieving burdensome regulations. And she didn't stop there. During her tenure Haley slashed taxes to give breathing room which allowed employers to invest in their employees and build new infrastructure. Haley's pro-business strategy worked, and in return she created thousands of jobs and turned the Palmetto State into an economic powerhouse. In today's economic blues, of high interest rates and inflation, America could use a pro-business, conservative leader like Nikki Haley. Someone who treats employers like friends, not enemies to regulate and burden with cumbersome taxes. I believe Nikki Haley is the new face for eight years of conservative leadership. She's tough, strong, morally clear, and she thinks outside the box. I think her pro-jobs approach can fix our nation's struggling economy. I urge you to join me in caucusing for Nikki on Jan. 15.","","",""

If Trump feels so strongly about his false attacks, he should stop hiding and defend them on the debate stage in Des Moines."" Here Are The Facts Haley signed one of the toughest anti-illegal immigration laws in the country in 2011, back when Trump was still a liberal.  It was an Arizona-style bill that required police to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest for another reason and suspect may be in the country illegally. It also enacted an E-Verify mandate.  Haley went head-to-head with the Obama administration on illegal immigration Haley fought Obama's DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano to enforce South Carolina's E-Verify law. Haley took the fight public, calling out the Obama administration until it backed down. Haley fought the Obama administration on accepting Syrian refugees, undocumented minors, and Guantanamo Bay prisoners in South Carolina. Haley opposed Trump's likely unconstitutional religious travel ban but supported his terrorist travel ban as UN ambassador. Haley defended Trump's revised travel ban as UN Ambassador multiple times because it targeted geographic areas with serious terrorist activity and not religious countries or individuals. The Supreme Court upheld the third version of Trump's ban specifically because ""the text says nothing about religion.""  Haley never opposed building a wall. She opposed ""just"" building a wall exclusively and called for a comprehensive plan that included drones, agents, resources, etc.  Haley: ""Don't say you're just going to build a wall. Because a wall is not going to do it. You've got to have commitment of ground troops, equipment, money, all of that to bring it together. Then you're being serious about tackling illegal immigration.""  Haley has never supported amnesty.","","",""

Haley wrote an op-ed arguing that the Russian invasion isn't just about Ukraine. If Russia wins in Ukraine, China wins. A win for Russia will embolden China and could lead to World War Three. Haley has a longstanding record of supporting Ukraine going back to her days as UN ambassador. Haley's first remarks to the UN Security Council were to condemn Russia's aggressive actions in Ukraine and call for the immediate end of the Russian occupation of Crimea. Haley was a standout critic of Russia in the Trump administration, saying Russia should ""never"" be trusted and Russia is ""never going to be our friend."" When Haley arrived at the UN, she ditched protocol and met with the Ukrainian ambassador before the Russian ambassador. Praise for Haley Wall Street Journal: Mr. DeSantis is competing with Nikki Haley and perhaps one or two others to see who can emerge as the main challenger to Mr. Trump in Iowa and beyond. Ms. Haley is gaining support because she shows conviction. A bob and weave on Ukraine doesn't look good by comparison.

I think she [Nikki Haley] is trying to provide an excuse for her not doing well.""  DES MOINES, Iowa – Ron DeSantis today joined Gary Sadlemyer live on KFAB's Morning news. The highlights are below. Listen to the full interview HERE. On Nikki Haley saying that Iowans' votes need to be ""corrected"":  I think it was incredibly disrespectful to Iowans to say somehow their votes need to be ""corrected."" I think she's trying to provide an excuse for her not doing well. You know, her allies and her have spent huge amount of money here. A lot of this money is coming from liberal donors on Wall Street and California. These are people that have supported Liberal Democrats in the past, and they're gravitating to Nikki Haley because they know she's not going to change anything in Washington. She's been governor for six years. What achievements did she have in South Carolina? Literally nothing. Her main achievement was being the number one Republican governor for bringing Chinese investment into her state. It's a huge contrast to a leadership of Governor Reynolds or myself. But I thought what she said to Iowans was very disrespectful. It was also coming on the heels of, just the other day, she confused the basketball star Caitlin Clark with a CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins. And I'm just thinking to myself, like, you know, you're just doing that. I'm actually doing a town hall on CNN tonight, and Kaitlan Collins is the moderator of it. And maybe I'll congratulate her on that buzzer-beater the other night.  On his main message to Iowa voters:  Donald Trump is running on his issues. Nikki Haley's running for her donors' issues. I'm running for your issues and your family's issues, and to turn this country around. I'm the only candidate that can say I've delivered on 100% of my promises as governor of Florida. I'm also the only candidate that can say all the things that Republicans have been complaining about with the political left, I beat these people on issue after issue, whether it's beating the teachers' unions for school choice, whether it's beating the left by banning China from buying land in Florida, whether it's beating Soros on crime by removing these progressive left prosecutors, or whether it's beating Fauci on COVID. So we're at a situation now where our country is on the wrong track. We need a president that's going to be able to come in there, turn it around, but actually deliver all these results. Because we've been talking about the border, we've been talking about a lot of these issues for years and years. And yet, it doesn't seem to get done. I will get the job done. I'm proud to be endorsed by Governor Kim Reynolds. And I think if you look at the great work she's done in Iowa, there's a lot of similarities to what we've done in Florida. And I think the way Iowa and Florida have approached all these issues over the last few years, that's the template for Republican success nationally. You remember in 2022, there was supposed to be a big red wave, Republican wave. That fizzled. That crashed and burned. The only places where you saw the wave were Iowa and Florida, and that was because we had strong conservative leadership delivering big results for the people we represent.  On his strong organization and ground game ahead of the Iowa Caucuses:  We have organized all 99 counties. We have over 1500 precinct captains that are going to be in each individual precinct. We're going to have these people and others speaking on our behalf. So we have probably the best organization that anyone's been able to do. And we did that intentionally because, historically, that is how you do well in the Iowa caucus. The people that just swoop in and do a rally here or there, people that just spend gobs of money on television, that typically doesn't work. So you got to do that. So we have done that organization. But what's been helpful about building the organization is I'm the only candidate that's gone to all 99 counties. I'm showing up. I'm answering questions everywhere. A lot of these other candidates aren't willing to do that. I mean, obviously, Donald Trump won't answer questions at all and won't debate. Nikki Haley only answers scripted questions, usually that are planted in the audience. And so we've done it right. And I think you're going to see that come to fruition on caucus night.","","",""

That's a lot of money and the latest sign of a lot of momentum as well... She's moving up in Iowa and New Hampshire.

NewsNation: That tally is more than double what Haley's campaign raised in the third quarter and triple what she raised in the second.

Scared enough to put millions of dollars behind false ads attacking Haley. The first attack ad was panned by fact checkers. The second ad is just as ridiculous. ""All the lame nicknames in the world don't change the fact that Donald Trump is clearly terrified of Nikki Haley's momentum,"" said Haley communications director Nachama Soloveichik. ""Nikki passed one of the toughest anti-illegal immigration bills in the country back when Trump was still a Democrat. Trump should spend more time explaining why he never fulfilled his signature promise to build a wall instead of desperately trying to mislead voters with easily debunked ads."" LIE: Haley opposed Trump's border wall (Time Magazine, 2/1/23) TRUTH: Haley never opposed building the wall. She opposed building the wall exclusively, arguing that we need a comprehensive approach that includes drones, planes, border agents, infrastructure, and more. Haley's full comments: ""If you notice, they're all saying, 'we want to secure the borders.' That's a big deal. What does that mean to you? That's what I want to hear. That's what I think the country wants to hear. What does that mean to you in terms of your commitment to work with Congress to actually secure the border? Don't say you're just going to build a wall. Because a wall is not going to do it. You've got to have commitment of ground troops, equipment, money, all of that to bring it together. Then you're being serious about tackling illegal immigration."" (National Press Club, ~44:53, 9/02/15) LIE: Haley opposed Trump's travel ban (CNN 12/9/15) TRUTH: Haley supported banning travel for people from countries with serious terrorist activity, but opposed religious tests. Trump himself dropped his support for a Muslim ban that was widely panned as unconstitutional in favor of a travel ban from countries posing a national security risk. The Supreme Court upheld the third version of Trump's ban specifically because ""the text says nothing about religion."" In fact, Haley defended Trump's revised travel ban as UN Ambassador multiple times because it targeted geographic areas with serious terrorist activity and not religious countries or individuals. NBC, 3/16/17: ""He's saying 'let's temporarily pause, and you prove to me that the vetting is ok, that I can trust these people coming through for the American people. CNN, 8/22/17: ""I think the travel ban was based on certain threats and more importantly, it was based on the fact that ... we didn't have enough information. The goal was always, and the goal continues to be for the president, to keep Americans safe. In those countries, we had the info that we feel like we can monitor, and we can screen, and we can make sure exactly who is coming into our country. In those other countries on the travel ban, we don't have that, and that is not just to keep everybody out of America."" NDTV, 06/28/18: ""It's not a Muslim ban, because there are many countries that have Muslims that are allowed to come into the United States, and of the travel ban, there are countries on that list that don't have anything to do with the Muslim community. This is about safety. This is about terrorism and what the United States security agencies did was, they looked at every country and any country that we don't have enough information on the people that want to come into this country, where it's our sovereign right to say we should take a step back and make sure we have all of the information. We need to protect the people. It has nothing to do with religion. It has everything to do with the changing world that we're in today, and the fact that terrorism has been on the rise."" Haley's Strong Record on Tackling Illegal Immigration As South Carolina governor, Haley signed one of the toughest immigration laws in the country. In 2011, Haley signed the South Carolina Illegal Immigration Reform Act, requiring police to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest for another reason and suspect may be in the country illegally. The bill required South Carolina employers to use the federal E-Verify system to check the citizenship status of employees. The Post and Courier called these measures ""some of the nation's toughest measures to curb illegal immigrants living and working here."" Haley went head-to-head with the Obama administration on illegal immigration. Haley fought Obama's DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano to enforce South Carolina's E-Verify law. Haley took the fight public, calling out the Obama administration until it backed down. South Carolina filed a suit challenging Obama's constitutional authority after he issued an executive order giving temporary legal status to millions of illegal immigrants. Haley fought the Obama administration on accepting Syrian refugees, undocumented minors, and Guantanamo Bay prisoners in South Carolina. In April 2023, Haley visited 400 miles along the southern border and released a comprehensive plan to secure the border.","","",""

As governor, Haley signed into law a number of bills that expanded, extended, or allowed for local fee and tax hikes. Not only did Governor Haley raise taxes on the hardworking citizens of South Carolina, she used their tax dollars to lure Chinese companies to the state, with lavish incentives, tax breaks and handouts. Haley even gave land near a military base to a company owned by the Chinese Communist Party.

The war is being waged on us by Mexican drug cartels, who are bringing Chinese-manufactured fentanyl across our southern border, killing our citizens. And they're trafficking innocent children to be sexually abused. The crisis is with the millions of illegal aliens pouring into our country, overwhelming local jurisdictions and escaping accountability. Without the ability to know who is coming into our country, we run the risk of terrorists entering through the southern border to perpetrate a horrific attack. And without the ability to control our border, we lose our sovereignty as a nation. This crisis has reached unprecedented levels under President Joe Biden, who has failed to fulfill his constitutional oath to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. Biden would not have been able to get away with letting in 8 million illegal aliens if we had a border wall — something Donald Trump promised, but failed to deliver. As president, I will end this chaos and reclaim our sovereignty. On day one of my presidency, I will declare a national emergency and shut down all illegal entries. Phony asylum claims aimed at bypassing proper immigration processes will no longer be entertained. I will end the abuse of parole authority being used to usher in thousands of illegal immigrants monthly. And I will fully empower Border Patrol and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to deport those with no legitimate right to be here. There will be consequences for other nations — like Mexico and those in Central America — that allow this travesty to continue. They will either stop enabling illegal immigration through their jurisdictions and into America or face diplomatic and economic retaliation. Also under my presidency, the influence of big corporations on our immigration system will end. Big companies spend millions lobbying for open borders to get cheap labor. They will have no influence in my administration. I will build the wall and I will make Mexico pay for it. Donald Trump promised this, and not only failed to deliver on this promise, but has now backed away from the promise altogether. Here's how I'll get this done: Charge fees on remittances that foreign nationals working in the U.S. send abroad. We will collect those fees — totaling billions of dollars a year — and use them to finance the wall. In addition, I will ensure that states have the authority to enforce immigration laws — something that will serve as a force multiplier for our efforts. I will work with states that want to be part of the solution and enforce penalties on those that do not. In opposition to the Biden administration's willful neglect of our southern border, Florida under my leadership has been a bulwark of immigration enforcement. I sent the Florida National Guard to the border when Washington did nothing. I sent illegal aliens out of Florida's communities and to so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" such as Martha's Vineyard. And I signed the strongest anti-illegal immigration legislation in the country. Finally, we will deport the millions of migrants released into every corner of this nation by empowering our ICE agents, streamlining the court process, and adamantly insisting our existing immigrations laws are followed. The mistakes of the past will be rectified under the DeSantis administration. The border has been a persistent problem my entire adult life, and that is unacceptable. I will bring this issue to a conclusion once and for all. No excuses, I will get the job done, and I will not let you down.","","",""

He's doing what countless Iowans and Americans have always done — keep our country safe from foreign enemies who want to destroy us. But back at home, Democrats and Republicans have been destroying America's economy and finances for a long time. Reckless spending is stifling our economy even as our military is falling behind. And they're crippling us at the worst time. Communist China is the most dangerous enemy we've faced in at least 75 years, yet our politicians are spending America toward defeat. We need a president who stops this madness. We have to win this struggle and keep the peace. This crisis is unprecedented. In the past 10 years, we've added more than $10 trillion to the national debt—pushing it well over $30 trillion. We'll hit $34 trillion in the coming weeks. We're now adding around $1.5 trillion a year. Every cent of wasteful spending drives inflation now and tax hikes later — hitting families with both. We're on the verge of spending more on interest than national defense. America will be like a family that's maxed out its credit cards. We won't have money for emergencies. Yet the world we live in is getting more dangerous, not less, and America is getting less able to protect itself. I speak hard truths, and here's a painful one. Republicans and Democrats are both to blame. Barack Obama and Joe Biden both loved to waste the American people's money, but so did George W. Bush and Donald Trump. Everyone talks about the good economy under Trump — but at what cost? He put us $8 trillion in debt in just four years. Our kids will never forgive us for that. My highest priority as president will be to keep Americans safe. That's why I'll veto any bill that doesn't get us back to pre-pandemic spending levels and end hundreds of billions in corporate bailouts and special-interest handouts. I'll reform entitlements, the biggest drivers of our national debt, while protecting everyone who depends on Social Security and Medicare. And we will send a message to Congress. They have only passed four budgets on time in 40 years. That is unacceptable. That is why we will institute a new system: No on time budget, no pay. Congress has one job. They owe it to the taxpayers to take their job seriously.","","",""

She discussed her gains on Donald Trump, her lead over Joe Biden, and Biden's weakness on the economy and China.   On Haley gaining on Trump... ""I've done over a 150 town halls, taking every question, shaking every hand. I'm the last person to leave. Iowans and people in New Hampshire and South Carolina, they want to see you, they want to be able to ask those questions. You have to go and show that you want to earn their support, not just expect it. And I think that's what we're seeing. We had hundreds of people at our town hall last night in Rye, New Hampshire. We're going to have hundreds now lining up to see us in Kingston. We're going to be in Iowa tomorrow. The momentum on the ground is strong. People want something different. They're tired. They want to feel like government is serving them and they're not working for government. And in order to do that, we need to have a new generational leader that's ready to take on the problems with new solutions in the future. And I think right now, the problem is you've got Biden and Trump who aren't showing up, aren't answering questions of the voters, and aren't standing with their opponents, and it's a problem."" Haley on winning up and down the ticket... ""We need to do this for the sake of our kids and our grandkids, to make sure that we get America back. Because we can never be so arrogant to think that we can go into a nail-biter of an election. If you look at any of those head-to-heads against Biden, Trump, head-to-head, on a good day, they're even, he might be up by two. Wall Street Journal showed he's up by four. I'm in every one of those same general election polls. I defeat Biden by 17 points. 17 points. That's bigger than the presidency. That's when you're winning governorships, the House, the Senate, all the way to school board."" On Joe Biden's weakness on the economy and China...  ""And regardless of what state you're in, Biden can go to them and say the economy is great all day long, but everybody knows that's not true when they go to the grocery store, when they go to the gas station, when they pay their mortgage bill, when they see their insurance payments. Everything that we have to pay has gone up, and Biden has seriously contributed to that. So he can go and say that China is a competitor, and we can go and see all of the intrusion that's happened in our country from China and say, no, China is not a competitor, they're an enemy. And we need to look at them the way they look at us. Biden has for too long thought that if he tells us things that we'll just believe him. That's not the case. We can't continue to have Biden. And let's never forget, a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris, and that should send a chill up everyone's spine.""","","",""

DES MOINES, IA - Ron DeSantis today joined America's Newsroom live. The highlights are below. Watch the full interview here. On his upcoming debate with Nikki Haley: We're going to do a debate, and we're going to be able to have a sharp contrast in our visions. And I think she's had a very difficult time recently because her, she had been pumped up by liberal media, which I understand she's the liberal candidate running, and now she's come under scrutiny, and she's not been able to handle basic questions that people are asking. She's not been able to defend her record as governor of South Carolina, where she was the number one governor of bringing in Chinese Communist Party investment into her state. In Florida, I banned China from buying land in Florida. I kicked them out of our universities. So it's just a contrast in visions, contrast in records, and clearly, Republican voters are going to prefer my vision to hers. On his strong organization ahead of the Iowa Caucuses: We're excited by the support that we have. We've now top 1500 precinct captains who are going to actually be there on the caucus. This is what you have to do. It's an organizational intensive effort. And so we've really put our mind to doing it that way. You know, what I have, I think that no other candidate has, is I have a record of delivering on 100% of my promises. If you look at all the problems in this country that the left is inflicting -- from open borders, to crime, to the bad economic policies -- I've beaten these people in Florida. Whether it's the teachers' unions, whether it's George Soros, whether it's the Democratic Party, we took a state that was evenly divided, and the Democratic Party now lies in ruins. We've shown how to win. You guys have been covering the issue with the Harvard President getting fired. I'm the only one running for president that's taken on the rot in higher education in Florida. This whole idea of DEI, they say it's diversity, equity, and inclusion. It really stands for discrimination, exclusion, and indoctrination. We eliminated it from our public universities. We are focusing our universities on the core mission of what academia used to be: pursuing truth and preparing our students to be citizens of the Republic, not to be indoctrination centers. So I've taken on the left and beat them in ways that Donald Trump and other candidates just simply have not. And this is the do or die time for this country. We're in a period of decline. We need to reverse it. I'll get it done. On the president of Harvard's resignation: Places like Harvard had been captured by a militant left ideology. And so it's not about academic excellence, like universities used to be geared toward in this country, it's really about promoting their vision of so-called social justice. So it's got a massive endowment. It's basically a hedge fund with an indoctrination camp attached to it. That is academia run amok. That is not going to be successful for this country. They are not going to be producing the type of leaders that they may have been able to produce in the past. And so we've taken this on in Florida. We've said our state universities are funded by the taxpayers of Florida. They should be focused on things that are in the best interest of the people of Florida. That means we want academic integrity, we want merit based academia, and we do not want discriminatory policies like DEI. So we stepped up, and we did something about it.","","",""

The war is being waged on us by Mexican drug cartels, who are bringing Chinese-manufactured fentanyl across our southern border, killing our citizens. And they're trafficking innocent children to be sexually abused. The crisis is with the millions of illegal aliens pouring into our country, overwhelming local jurisdictions and escaping accountability. Without the ability to know who is coming into our country, we run the risk of terrorists entering through the southern border to perpetrate a horrific attack. And without the ability to control our border, we lose our sovereignty as a nation. This crisis has reached unprecedented levels under President Joe Biden, who has failed to fulfill his constitutional oath to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. Biden would not have been able to get away with letting in 8 million illegal aliens if we had a border wall — something Donald Trump promised, but failed to deliver. As president, I will end this chaos and reclaim our sovereignty. On day one of my presidency, I will declare a national emergency and shut down all illegal entries. Phony asylum claims aimed at bypassing proper immigration processes will no longer be entertained. I will end the abuse of parole authority being used to usher in thousands of illegal immigrants monthly. And I will fully empower Border Patrol and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to deport those with no legitimate right to be here. There will be consequences for other nations — like Mexico and those in Central America — that allow this travesty to continue.

The highlights are below. Watch the full interview HERE. On Nikki Haley's false claims about his record on China:  I banned China from buying land in the state of Florida. I kicked China out of our universities, these Confucius Institutes, and we've cracked down on them taking our trade secrets. No governor in the country has done more to stand up to the Chinese Communist Party. Nikki Haley, on the other hand, when she was governor, she was the number one governor in America of bringing the Chinese Communist Party into her state. They gave land near a military base for a Chinese company. She went to a Chinese company right in front of the Chinese flag and said that she works for them. And of course, she said China is a friend. Now she's trying to act tough because she knows how toxic those positions are with Republican primary voters. But here's the thing, her donors, these liberal donors in California and on Wall Street, they make money in China. She would not stand up to China. And so I think the Haley as Governor, that would be the Haley you would get. So it's a clear contrast. She's grasping at straws to try to do the nonsense. And I think what they're trying to hit me on is something that happened in Florida before I was even governor. So you know, if they're hitting you for things that your predecessor did, I must have done a pretty doggone good job.  On working to earn the support of Iowans in the closing stretch:  This is a race to get the majority of the delegates. We've done Iowa the way people who have done well in Iowa have done -- which is beyond the ground, create the organization. The polling has never predicted how the results come out because it's a caucus, and it's just a different beast. And so we're doing what it takes to win. I've been to all 99 counties, and we're going to be able to do a lot more. But it's an important part of the process that you actually come and take questions from people, answer their questions, even participate in debates. And so we're going to be participating in a debate on CNN. The former president has declined that, but Governor Haley is going to do it. So it's going to be a one on one debate between me and Nikki Haley. So I'm looking forward to doing that, and that'll just help the voters be able to make their best decision going forward.  On why Donald Trump owes it to Iowans to debate:  The right thing to go is to stand and talk about your record. Why shouldn't he have to answer questions? I mean, he's running on things like deporting illegals and building a wall, but he did that in '16 and didn't get it done. So I think he owes answers to those questions. He has not been willing to do that. Obviously, if you go by polling, it hasn't hurt. But I think now that we're in the new year, I think voters do expect you to answer those questions. I think Iowans expect you to show up and debate.","","",""

Leadership is ultimately about producing results for the people that you represent."" Des Moines, IA - Ron DeSantis this evening participated in a town hall with Gray TV's Iowa Political Director Dave Price live from the WOWT studio. The highlights are below. Watch the full town hall here. On his main message to voters: Very simple. Donald Trump is running on his issues. Nikki Haley is running on her donors' issues. I'm running on your issues, your family's issues, and turning this country around. That'll be my sole focus. It's not about me, I've got a lot of humility in doing this. As a leader, I'm just the vessel for your hopes, dreams, and aspirations. I will get the job done for you. On his leadership philosophy: It's not about entertainment. Leadership's not about showmanship. Leadership is ultimately about producing results for the people that you represent. And I had to make decisions during COVID that put the interests of my people, their jobs and their freedom over my own personal political interest, because I was getting hammered all the time for a lot of the decisions I made to buck conventional wisdom. And I was perfectly willing to let the political chips fall where they may, because I had to stand up for those folks. So I'll be a president that will fight for you. And it's one thing to say that when the wind's at your back. It's much more difficult to do that when they're shooting at you and slinging arrows atc you. You can count on me though. When the chips are down and you need someone standing up for you, I'll be the guy to do that. On the key differences between him and Donald Trump: I have rendered very sharp contrast between Donald Trump and myself with respect to policy. For example, he's running on a lot of the things he promised to do in 2016 and didn't deliver on. He said he was going to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it; didn't do it. He said that he was going to drain the swamp; didn't do it. He said he was going to eliminate the debt, and yet he added $7.8 trillion dollars to the debt. So those were not things that he dealt with effectively. The Democrats seem to beat him on the budget, the Democrats beat him by denying the border wall, and that's not going to happen with me. I'm going to get all these things done. On how he'll secure the border and stop the invasion: We will declare it to be a national emergency on day one. I'm going to have the military on the border to stop the invasion cold. But one of the things we have to do is, people come illegally, we've had millions under Biden, I'm going to deport them back to their home country. You have got to do that. Donald Trump promised the largest deportations in history. He deported less, believe it or not, than Barack Obama even did. So I'm going to do that. Number two, we are going to build the wall and have Mexico pay for it. How do you do that? Mexico is not just going to give us money. You charge fees on the remittances that workers send overseas. That'll raise billions. We'll build the wall. But most importantly, we're going to hold the Mexican drug cartels accountable. I'm going to categorize them as foreign terrorist organizations. That's going to give us an ability to use deadly military force against them. On how he will combat Bidenflation: One, we need to put the spending levels back prior to COVID. That would save hundreds of billions of dollars. They ratcheted up the spending during COVID. I think that was a huge mistake, if you look at how they handled all that all that printing of money has led to you paying more for prices, because when you print money, of course, you're going to get inflation. It's driven us deeper into debt, it's caused interest rates to go up. And now you have massive amounts of money for interest on the debt. So bring that spending back to where we were four or five years ago, freeze that in place for the non-defense, and then get the interest rates down so that you can handle the debt, without having this drop 800 or 900 billion or a trillion dollars a year. On the importance of biofuels in the agriculture industry: I think biofuels are American made. They produce good American jobs, and they're part of an overall strategy to have strong energy policy where we control our own destiny. I think it's been a big part of the Midwest and the economy here. I think a lot of farmers have done better as a result of having that as an option. So that's one of the things I've been able to do just by traveling around. I've been to all 99 counties, I've been able to go to a lot of farms, I've been able to go and visit a lot of ethanol plants. And I've been able to talk to folks who've been impacted by this. What we're going to do is we're going to open up the blend wall because there's potential to do much higher blends. On why he's best suited to serve as Commander-In-Chief: I'm the only veteran running for President. I'd be the first veteran who served in a foreign war elected president since 1988. So veterans issues are close to my heart. These will be top tier issues with me as president. And I don't think we've had a president that's put them front and center the way they should have been in recent-, in my lifetime. So we will do that... I have veterans coming up to me, in Iowa and beyond and frequently they will say that they're not sure they would advise their kids or grandkids to join the current military. So as commander in chief on day one, I'm taking all the political nonsense out of the military. We're going to refocus it on Mission First. Promotions are going to be done through merit and achievement. And that's the way it's going to be, that's going to create an increase in morale and I think more people are going to want to serve. On how his faith impacts him as a leader: Well, faith in God is just, you know, who I am. And my faith is my foundation. It's how I am able to deal with issues when the seas are choppy, when people are gunning for you, you know, I put on that full armor of God, and that allows me to have the strength to be able to lead. We saw this when my wife got diagnosed with breast cancer. [It was a] major thing, I mean, our kids were four, three, and one at the time, and we didn't know what was going to happen. The prayers we got from people, not just in Florida, but throughout the country, lifted her spirits, it lifted our family's spirits in a way that was really powerful. And I'm a firsthand believer in the power of prayer. And as governor, I think I would not have been able to stand strong during COVID, during some of the fights we had where we beat Disney on the transgender ideology, keeping that out of the schools and the elementary schools, because you got a lot of people that gun for you. And so I think having that faith, the faith in God, really gives you the foundation where you're standing strong for what's right. Now, in terms of how that relates beyond that, I mean, we're a diverse country. I mean, I've gone to, just in Iowa, I've gone to a number of different denominations. And they all have, you know, great traditions, and government needs to be neutral amongst that. I mean, you know, there's not going to be an established denomination versus others. But we are a country that is based on the idea that our rights come from God, not from the government. That's in the Declaration of Independence. And you absolutely have a right to not just go to church on Sunday and practice your faith there, but to live your faith in what you do in your daily lives. We're going to make sure that we restore religious liberty in this country because when you have situations where a football coach like Coach Kennedy is losing his job in Washington State because he led a voluntary prayer at midfield after a high school game and he has to go all the way to the Supreme Court, that is not what our Founding Fathers intended. They absolutely intended that your faith would be an important part of who you are, and that you have a right as a free citizen to live that out to the fullest.","","",""

DES MOINES, Iowa – Ron DeSantis today joined Max and Amy in the Morning live on WHO radio. The highlights are below. Listen to the full interview here. On his message to Iowans in the final two weeks: We're going to keep showing up, answering people's questions, being in all the communities that we can. My wife is also in town, and so she's doing her thing. She's very effective on the campaign trail. And look, this is ultimately -- Iowa has a chance to really change the trajectory of the country. They can upend all the media narratives. The way I view the choice between caucus-goers is, you have Donald Trump running on his issues, Nikki Haley running on her donors' issues, and I'm running on your issues. I'm running on your family's issues, and I'm running on this country's issues, and I have a record of achievement down in Florida delivering on all these things and notching big win after big win. That's what we need to do in this country. We need to change the trajectory, and we got to start winning again. On the results of the Citrus Bowl yesterday: The playoff games were both good games last night. I think Michigan is probably favored. And so, we're going to have the big conference shake up where those specific teams are going to be in the Big 10, and the SEC is going to get Texas, and some of these others. But I think what Michigan did shows that the big 10, you know, down in the southeast we're kind of like, oh, the SEC is all that. But I mean, Michigan handled Alabama, and I think they're probably going to win the national championship. So I think that's good for the conference.  On being the hardest working candidate in the race:  It's a lot of hard work. We've worked very hard. I mean, I've gone to all 99 counties in Iowa, you know, I've done more town halls and took more questions than any candidate. And we're happy to do that, and that's what you need to do. Not everyone's willing to do that. And so a lot of it has actually been fun because you get to meet a lot of great people, you get to hear from people in a variety of different parts of the country -- heck, even different parts of Iowa -- where they're talking about different issues. So that part I think has actually been good. I'm glad that we do it this way. I think it makes you a better candidate, and I think it makes you a better governor, President, you know, whatever position you're in... there's some things you just can't control. So what I've tried to do is just focus on the things I can control. I can determine how hard I work, which I'm going to work very hard. You know, I can determine the message that I want to deliver for people, which I think we've got a powerful message.  On spending time with the family for Christmas:  We did get to go to Florida for Christmas, so we had a few days there where we were just normal people. We -- you know, and part of it is people during Christmas, they're not exactly going to attend campaign events. So we're just like, you know what, we're going to do that. Santa came through very well. I will say, you know, Santa probably didn't do the best job wrapping the presents. Maybe a little too much eggnog there. But what ends up happening is the kids wake up and rip it open right away anyways, and so it's all good. And I spent a lot of Christmas and the next day putting together a lot of the things that they got.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/369236",4980,"Des Moines Register by Christine Hensley and David Oman Happy New Year, Iowa! In a nation rife with division, 75 percent of Americans agree we want choices for president other than Joe Biden and Donald Trump. We are among them. Two weeks ago, Kevin Williamson wrote in the Wall Street Journal, ""Nobody makes boots tall enough to wade through the avalanche of bulls-t headed our way in the next 11 months."" He nailed it. The Biden and Trump families likely will be in courtrooms dealing with criminal, ethics and tax charges for years. America doesn't have to be. America can do better. Our shared 2024 New Year's resolution is to urge Iowans and Americans to elect a new, different, younger and stronger president to take office in January 2025. We can also make Iowa and American history in an entirely new way. We fully and confidently support former United Nations Ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as the Republican nominee for president of the United States in 2024. This past summer and fall, Haley has campaigned across Iowa with courage, conviction and charisma. Haley does not talk down to or demean people. With optimism and hope, she lifts people up. Haley doesn't dredge up the past and recycle it. Instead, she learns from history and offers fresh ideas. Why is this so rare these days? Haley is clear-eyed about the challenges America faces in both hemispheres. As ambassador, she dealt with them at the United Nations after serving as a successful governor of her state. Many Iowans respectfully remember former Iowa Gov. Robert Ray. Few recall he, too, served at the United Nations as a member of the U.S. delegation after leaving office in 1983. Ray, who served as governor from 1969 to 1983, talked then about how important it was for America to constantly explain and defend western values of freedom, democracy and human rights at the U.N. As ambassador, Haley did that every day, earning bipartisan and global respect. In a turbulent world, this is not the time to elect a former president who carries chaos with him every day. Or to reelect a president who ducks, dithers and delays. It is time for the United States, the world's oldest democracy, to elect an ""Iron Lady"" president. Haley is our nation's best strategic choice next year. The electoral process starts in Iowa; its best outcome can begin here, too. Starting well behind others but working hard, Haley has become known, liked, respected and admired here. Her logic, ideas and toughness with a winsome persona win hearts and minds across Iowa every day. A core team with many women — Sen. Chris Cournoyer, Emily Sukup Schmitt, Dawn Roberts, Mary Ann Hanusa and others — has been joined by men and women of all ages and parts of Iowa's GOP ""big tent"" and independents, too. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' Iowa polling numbers have dropped over the past year, while Haley's numbers have tripled and continue to rise.  Iowans should also pay attention to the recent New York Times-Siena College Poll comparing top Republican contenders vs. President Biden in the general election. The numbers are stunning: DeSantis 45, Biden 45 — a discouraging tie and possible loss in the offing… Trump 47, Biden 43 — a modest lead on which no one would bet the farm… Haley 51, Biden 34 — a blowout 17-point lead helped by women and independents. A big win at the presidential level would be of great help to Iowa's four Republican House members and GOP legislative candidates on the ballot next November. A big win is also a ""means to an end"" bringing overdue policy changes — strengthening national security, closing the open border, limiting out of control federal spending, growing our economy and creating millions of good jobs. Some still deny, obfuscate or minimize Trump-era election results in 2018, 2020 and 2022. The hard truth is Republicans lost elections all over the country. The national ""red wave"" never showed up. Indeed, we have lost the popular vote for president in seven of the last eight elections after 1988. Do Republicans want to keep losing? Or do we want to stride with strength into the future? How about winning big enough so no one doubts the outcome? Republicans haven't seen anything close to a 17 percentage-point win since Reagan beat Mondale by 18 points in 1984! Iowa has been fortunate to start the presidential election process for 48 years. Unfortunately, national Democrats have kicked the Iowa Caucus to the curb. In our Republican Caucus, Iowans can propel a well-qualified woman forward in the presidential selection process. The opportunity is right in front of us: The challenge is hard; the stakes are high. If we get this right, Iowa can lead in nominating and electing a new, transformational president. We can make great history for our caucuses, our party, our state and our nation. If you agree with our New Year's resolution, we invite you to join us. Please vote for Nikki Haley Monday evening, Jan. 15. Thanks for reading and Happy New Year!","","",""

""Visibly uncomfortable with this question."" ""Absolutely dopey."" ""Word salad of platitudes."" ""Wait until the left piles on and the heat turns up, I think you are going to see Nikki Haley getting Hillary Clinton-like"" Des Moines, IA - Nikki Haley is on day three of trying to clean up the inexplicable gaffe she made in New Hampshire about the cause of the Civil War, and she is only continuing to make things worse. Here is more of what they are saying: Wall Street Journals' Jason Riley: This was an unforced error on her part. Two things can be true, that this was a plant and that she badly flubbed the answer. I'm quite shocked. This is a former governor of South Carolina, where she dealt with the Confederate flag issue as governor, I would think that she'd be prepared for questions like this. If you are asked a question about the cause of the Civil War, and you do not mention slavery in the answer, that is not an accident. That is not an omission. You are being coy. And she got called on it. I mean, the Declaration of Secession of South Carolina, written back in 1860, explicitly cites slavery and northern opposition to expanding slavery. So, you don't need to take my word for it or Nikki Haley's word for it. You can take what South Carolinians were saying at the time, she should have been ready for this question. National Review's Caroline Downey : She buckled under pressure. You're right. If you're in the hot seat as a Republican contender... you have to be good on your feet and this is a no brainer. So why in her kind of subsequent answer to the press did she say, 'of course, it's an easy question?' Addressing the town hall, she was implying that it was not an easy question, that it was complicated, the nature of it, when in fact, it's plain and simple slavery. States' rights and all of that disputing, yeah that's kind of a side story. But everybody knows what was at the crux of the Civil War, of that conflict. So in reality, I think she proves she's not as good on the fly, impromptu as we would hope she would be as a presidential contender. Tomi Lahren: He's not wrong. He says John Kerry, I say Republican version of Bud Light. But either way, this is not a good moment for Nikki Haley, but you're going to start to see this crank up now that she is edging up in the polls. She is relatively unscathed until the last couple of weeks. Now, she is getting the treatment that Ron DeSantis has been getting for the last year and a half. So, it'll be interesting to see how she handles it. The slavery comment the other day, or the lack of the slavery comment, not good for her. Wait until the left piles on and the heat turns up, I think you are going to see Nikki Haley getting Hillary Clinton-like and I'm no fan of Nikki Haley, so, I got to be honest with you guys, I don't mind seeing it... She's going to have to handle more of this criticism and I hope she doesn't say that this kid was a plant. Fox News' Griff Jenkins: She had a tough day the day before with the civil war. Now she is getting put on the spot and owned by a 9-year-old child accusing her of being John Kerry. It's been a rough go in New Hampshire where she has been climbing in the polls. But, you know, she needs fewer moments like this, if she is to really catch up with the overwhelming frontrunner Donald Trump and more moments talking about things like the border that we were talking about and as you rightly point out, Joey, a great opportunity to own an issue. National Review's Rich Lowry: It was kind of a weird moment. She was visibly uncomfortable with this question. It was like she felt trapped by this question, totally at sea with how to answer this question. It was a very basic question, so, it was not a great moment for her. Tiana Lowe Doescher: That was not the answers that her fans are used to. It was not a very cogent answer. Newsmax Wake Up America Panel: ROB FINNERTY: Nikki Haley getting some serious backlash after she failed to mention slavery. When she was asked a random question at a town hall in New Hampshire, the question although it was out of nowhere, the answer should be fairly simple. What was the cause of the Civil War? Haley's response, let's just call it incomplete. JAKE NOVAK: Well, she fumbled obviously... Absolutely dopey for not to just answer that question and move on... But the bigger problem is that now you have - it just goes to show another thing I love to say - political consultants are really bad at what they do. And this is someone who probably said, 'Well, if you get these kinds of questions, show how smart you are. Talk about something about from a libertarian point of view... differentiate yourself.' No. If the answer is four, and two plus two, or the answer is slavery causes Civil War, just say that and move on. And these people have to justify their salary so they tell them stupid things. ROB FINNERTY: ...Okay, so she's implying that this was some sort of plant and that was the narrative yesterday, Betsy, it doesn't matter if this was a Trump plant, or a Democratic plant. BETSY MCCAUGHEY: Or somebody from Mars. ROB FINNERTY: It's a pretty simple question. BETSY MCCAUGHEY: That's right. National Review's Dan McLaughlin: What we've seen in the post-gaffe cleanup has been more of the same. She blamed the questioner for being a Democratic plant. That may well be true, but it's irrelevant: This wasn't some viral moment where an ""undecided voter"" chewed her out, it was a softball question... Then, we get Haley's effort at a do-over, which is yet another word salad of platitudes... The next few weeks will be a serious test of whether this is just one silly-season news cycle, or whether Haley really is not ready for the next level. Townhall's Matt Vespa: I get that you don't want to answer this question, being a former governor from the first state to secede, but this is a softball, Nikki. National Review's Philip Klein: Her new position is that a Dem plant made her look like a blithering idiot, which is not exactly an encouraging sign for a Republican presidential candidate. Ann Coulter: Hey, Republicans! Wouldn't it be great to have a presidential candidate who doesn't terrify you whenever he's asked a question? VOTE DESANTIS! RealClearInvestigations Mark Hemmingway: No one actually believes this, and the question is likely a plant. However, Trump, DeSantis, and Ramaswamy — all three are good at recognizing a bad faith question and shoving it back down the questioner's throat. This is a necessary GOP skill, a Haley doesn't really have it.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/369177",5448,"Des Moines, IA - Ron DeSantis and South Carolina State Senator Josh Kimbrell today joined Doug Wagner live for an interview in-studio. The highlights are below. Listen to the full interview here. On slaying the deep state and stopping the swamp: As governor, I've showed how it's done. I mean, I've eliminated agencies, just like Governor Reynolds has here. Florida has the lowest percentage of bureaucrats per capita in the entire country. I have 3 million, 2-3 million more people than New York state. Our budget is half the size of New York with one of the lowest bureaucrat per citizen ratios in the country. And yet, people that move from New York will say you have better roads, you have better services, you have better education. So, much of government is not necessary. It just grows and grows. So we have actually shown how to do it in Florida. Now federally, I think it's a constitutional crisis, what's happened with the administrative state. The founding fathers created three branches of government. They did not create a fourth branch of government, a bureaucracy that basically imposes its will on us without our consent and has even been weaponized against us. So you're going to go in as President, I'm going to use all the levers of power to bring the administrative state to heel... Some of these bureaucrats, they laugh at elections. They don't care who gets elected. They're going to do whatever they want to do. That is not what the Founding Fathers intended. And you need somebody that understands the Constitution. You need somebody who has the focus and discipline to be able to claw this power back to the people. Senator Josh Kimbrell on why he’s in Iowa campaigning for Ron DeSantis: Well for starters, to defend the honor of my state, and secondly, to make sure we get a true leader for America. You know, Governor Haley's running around talking about how she made South Carolina such a great red state. We are red state. We used to be redder than Florida. We're probably not redder than Florida now, we're right there with them still. But most of the conservative reform --whether it's school choice, or passing tax cuts, or deregulation -- all that happened after Nikki Haley's tenure as governor, not because of it. And you talked a moment ago, the governor talks about reconstituting the country, reconstituting the government, re-constitutionalizing, making sure these bureaucrats aren't running your lives. One thing that people forget, one of the biggest threats to the country is not only the bureaucrats, it is the big business in bed with big government. We've seen companies like Blackrock, we've seen companies like Disney, we've seen companies like Citigroup all got their precious woke agenda. And you got to be willing to stand up to that to like the governor of Florida has. My governor's out there, former governor, [Nikki Haley] is out there hanging out with BlackRock and paling around with Jamie Dimon from Citi Group. And I don't want people around the country to think we in South Carolina are on board with this corporatist agenda. We believe in the free enterprise system, we believe in limited government, and that's why I want the president to be Ron DeSantis. On supporting farmers and the agriculture industry: This ESG agenda, this environment social governance, they talk about things like global warming, and they blame agriculture for a lot of this. And so these policies applied to agriculture will create a food crisis in this country. It will decimate agriculture. They want to talk about how you farm, they want to talk about how you use your land. All of everyone in Iowa that is involved in agriculture can know, when I'm President, all this ends on day one. We're going to throw all the ESG out. We're going to empower farmers to do what they do best. We're also going to crack down on states like California that are trying to tell Iowa Pork Producers how they should be producing pork. That's not the role for a liberal state to be telling the states in the Midwest. So help is on the way. But this is a dangerous agenda. And it's not just a matter of having a couple of misguided policies. They are going for the jugular when it comes to agriculture. Look don't worry about me. Like, I want people eating meat, I want people -- we got to do that. I mean, so some people on the left don't like that. We know it's important, and that's something that you can count on me for. Senator Josh Kimbrell on Ron DeSantis’ strong border policies: The reason every state's a border state is because of what Governor DeSantis did. I mean, let's be honest, people who sat in the ivory towers of Chicago and New York could do so with impunity because they didn't have all these people flooding into their town until Florida started sending those migrants there. We had to pay the price for it. Our state, we just passed legislation to basically deputize our state law enforcement to go after illegal immigration. Every state's a border state, the only person who can actually build the wall and get it done is Governor DeSantis. The former president talked about, he wanted to make Mexico pay for the wall, but he now says there's no mechanism to do so. But there's a mechanism to do so, the governor has pointed that out. You just got to be thoughtful and understand before you speak how you're going to execute a policy, and I think that's what makes Governor Ron DeSantis a great leader.","","",""

DES MOINES, Iowa – Ron DeSantis today joined Your World with Neil Cavuto’s guest host Edward Lawrence on Fox News Channel. The highlights are below. Watch the full interview HERE. On how Nikki Haley is not ready for primetime:  She's been very much fluffed by the media for the last six to eight weeks. Let's see how she does when she actually faces scrutiny. And I think when she gets off her talking points, I think she has a much more difficult task at that point. And part of it is, when you get into these races, and you're an elected official, what is your core foundation? And with me, my core foundation are the enduring principles that have made this country unique, our constitutional system, and that's just in my DNA as a candidate, as a governor and will be as a president. I think for her, I don't think she has those core convictions. I think she's trying to tell people what she thinks they may want to hear in the moment, rather than just say what the truth is. And you even hear this in some of her explanations now, where she's saying that she's talking about her truth. No, no, it's not your truth or my truth. It’s the truth. We need to be grounded in the truth. We got to throw this post modernism out the window.  On his message to Iowans ahead of the caucus:  I'm the guy that can get this done, just like we did in Florida -- winning a big victory, but even more importantly, delivering on 100% of my promises. We need somebody, a president, that is going to fight, and a lot of Republicans haven't even been willing to do that. We need a president that's going to win these big fights. And I've beat the left on issue after issue. And we need somebody that's going to be able to lead -- lead this country into a different direction, make sure that compass is set to true north, and get the job done. And I've shown I've been more effective down here in Florida than just about anybody in the country in modern memory. And yet you're talking about the economy, in Florida, I've paid down 25% of our debt since I've been governor, we have number one for new business formation, and our economy is ranked number one of all 50 states by CNBC. So we're showing how it's done on the economic and fiscal front. And if Washington did even half as good as Florida has done, we'd be in a much better spot nationally.  On Donald Trump being removed from the Maine ballot:  Well obviously, to have one executive branch official unilaterally striking someone off the ballot is not an appropriate interpretation of the 14th amendment. We could have, in Florida, what are we going to have Biden struck off the ballot because he's allowed an invasion of 8 million people, including enemy nations have sent people in? This could just be end up being a tit for tat. So I think it'll get reversed by the US Supreme Court. I think it's more of a stunt that you have a very liberal person in that position, who's just trying to play for cheap clicks. But ultimately, I don't think it's grounded in a proper interpretation of the Constitution.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370141",4823,"By: Jennifer NassourOnline here It's a political cliché, but triteness doesn't make it any less true: losing candidates do desperate, stupid things. Ron DeSantis is losing. Over nine months, he and his allies have spent $100 million only to lose half his support in the polls. Now, two weeks away from the Iowa caucuses, he's boxed himself into an Iowa-or-bust corner with his presidential ambitions hanging by a thread. As a result, he is also desperate. DeSantis is throwing a wide variety of attacks at the wall in the hopes that something — anything — will stick. The problem is many of the attacks on Nikki Haley reek of hypocrisy because DeSantis had the exact same positions. Bathroom Bills Ron DeSantis will tell you that he signed a bill directing people to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender at birth. That's true — he signed a bathroom bill on the cusp of launching his presidential campaign. Now rewind four years. In 2018, as a gubernatorial candidate — before he refashioned himself into an anti-woke warrior — DeSantis was dismissive of government meddling in the bathroom issue. He told Frank Luntz, ""I think getting into the bathroom wars — I don't think that's a good use of our time."" That hasn't stopped DeSantis from attacking Nikki Haley from having the same stance in 2016. The truth is that the bathroom issue wasn't as widespread in 2016 and 2018. Both Haley and DeSantis were aligned with the times when they argued it wasn't necessary for the government to get involved. But DeSantis has doubled down on this line of attack even as fact checkers point out this inconvenient truth. Social Security In a CNN town hall, Ron DeSantis attacked Haley for proposing an increase in the retirement age for workers in their 20s in order to deal with the Social Security's looming insolvency. Has DeSantis forgotten that he called for raising the retirement age in 2012 as a congressional candidate because ""the system was not originally designed for people to be on it for 30 years""? Has DeSantis forgotten that he voted for budget resolutions that would have raised the retirement age to 70 in 2013, 2014, and 2015? I'm sure, his memory is just fine. More likely, his desperation is just getting worse by the day. China Haley has admitted that she recruited Chinese businesses to South Carolina 10 years ago and also acknowledged that America's approach to China has rightly shifted since then. That hasn't stopped Ron DeSantis from spending millions of dollars attacking Haley on China. Nor has it stopped him from denying his own ties to Chinese businesses as governor. In the third presidential debate, DeSantis went after Haley, claiming that, ""You gave [China] stuff, I didn't give them anything."" This is demonstrably false. The DeSantis administration gave hundreds of thousands of dollars in state subsidies to Jinko Solar, a Chinese company that was raided by the Department of Homeland security six months ago. DeSantis also accepts campaign contributions from a Chinese-backed company while denying China's role in the company. And he recruited Chinese businesses for several years and boasted about his administration's efforts in promotional reports. George Floyd Ron DeSantis criticizes Haley's initial reaction to George Floyd's death, in which she said that his death should be ""painful and personal"" for everyone. This empathetic response to a graphic case of police brutality is somehow supposed to prove that Haley is too woke or too liberal to be president. Never mind that Haley has been extremely outspoken in her criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement and the riots and violence that ensued. Never mind also that Ron DeSantis had an eerily similar response to the Floyd video. ""When I saw the video of that cop murdering George Floyd, I was just absolutely appalled by what I saw,"" DeSantis told a group of reporters at the time. ""But I immediately asked folks at [the Florida Department of Law Enforcement] and others, 'How in the hell could you get away with even doing that tactic?' And sure enough, [in the] State of Florida, you do not put knee on a neck like that. That is not good training ... I think everyone agrees that's totally intolerable what happened."" The campaign trail is littered with the political corpses of candidates who failed to live up to their great expectations. Ron DeSantis will go down in the history books as a prime example. In his case, it wasn't a lack of resources or institutional support that felled him. It was his inauthenticity. At the presidential level, where candidates are forced to talk to voters face to face — not once, but over and over — voters can sniff out a phony. DeSantis' disingenuous attacks on Nikki Haley are solid proof of this. Jennifer Nassour is the former chair of the Massachusetts Republican Party.","","",""

I want to return this government to We the People."" Des Moines, IA - Ron DeSantis joined father-son duo Tork and Sawyer Whisler for a sit-down interview on their podcast, 'Barn Talk' filmed from their barn in Washington, Iowa. The highlights are below. Watch the full podcast episode here. On how the border crisis impacts Iowans: There's a narrative that, oh, if you're not a border town or a border state, then why would you care about it? But I was in small towns in Iowa where they have drugs coming in from the border, they've had issues with illegal aliens. And I think it's also just they saw what happened in Israel with the attacks. If Israel is the most -- they have the best border security in the world -- if they are having a massacre of people, we've had 8 million people come illegally. You don't think any of them are terrorists? Of course they've sent terrorists. And so I think that there's just a real understanding that this is just ridiculous, what's going on. It's harmful for our country, and it needs to be fixed. And, you know, it's humiliating that we can't even defend our own borders. You know, we will send money across the world, but we won't even take care of our own business here at home? How does that work? On the importance of Kim Reynolds' endorsement: It meant a lot. It's interesting because people would ask me, as I started to become more nationally known and I was getting a lot of attention -- a lot of negative attention because I was bucking Fauci on COVID -- but that turned me into somebody that Republicans were looking to, hey, this guy's fighting. And then we fought and beat Disney and we did all these other things. People would then come to me like, well, you know, why aren't other governor's doing this, or who else is out there? And I would always point to Kim, because Kim really came in, and you know, she had a tough election like I did in '18, and she took a lot of the tough decisions during COVID having kids in school and whatnot, she faced a lot of flak, and she's been able to deliver really, really big results. So I've been telling people this for many, many years because she's earned it, and she deserves it. And then to be able to get her to support me is a big deal. I think Iowa caucus-goers, when they see that, that's a huge, huge thing because probably 99% of the people that are going to caucus have a positive opinion of Governor Reynolds. On protecting the agriculture industry from authoritarianism: You also have the situation where a state like California could adopt something like proposition 12, and that ends up having a devastating impact in Iowa because of the size of California's market. I don't think California should be able to dictate how people are producing pork. I mean, that's just not good for the economy. It's not the way the system was designed to work. And I want states to be able to make their own decisions, but when they're trying to do things that have an effect outside their state, well, that's a different beast there. And I think what they've done -- they do these initiatives, people don't even know what they're voting on. They have no sense of how that would impact people who are actually in the industry. It's just kind of a thing that someone gets on the ballot, it sounds good, so they do it. That is not the way you do policy, particularly. And you don't want any industry, agriculture or others, to be at the mercy of the whims of the state like California, like that is just not going to work for this country. On how he'll deliver on his promises as president: I don't want to be liked in Washington. I don't care about the media, the bureaucrats, any of that. I want to return this government to we the people. It's gotten way, way outside its skis. It's focusing on issues that these entrenched elites care about, and it's leaving Americans behind. And we need to change that. And I think if we change that, you're going to see success across the board. I'll take care of the border. That's one thing about me-- when I say I'm going to do something, I do it. I don't just believe in campaign slogans. We're going to get the economy in a better shape. We're going to downsize the bureaucracy. We're going to crack down on crime in these liberal areas in particular. We're going to rebuild our military. We're going to make sure education is not about indoctrination. but classical education again. So we have so much to do. I've got the energy and the aptitude to do it. I have the leadership ability to bring people together. And I can do it for two, four-year terms. I don't think one four-year term is enough because the next guy comes in and they can reverse the progress. If you want this stuff to stick for the long term, you need a two-term president. On his family's love of college football: So my son is five. He's like a sports nut, so he knows all this stuff about sports. So we were in Sioux City the morning of the Iowa/Michigan Big 10 championship game. And you know, we've got a crowd of people there. I get called up, I bring him up, we're waving, I'm getting ready to do my thing. And I'm like, you know what, I'm going to ask him a football question. I didn't rehearse it with him. And I was like Mason, who's going to win the Iowa versus Michigan game? And as I'm putting the microphone down in front of his face, I'm thinking to myself, if this kid chooses Michigan, he's going to get booed at age five. So I put the microphone down, and he just kind of looked, and he's like, 'Iowa.' And everyone started cheering and everyone was happy. So he has rooted for that. It's interesting now. We were in, on Sunday night, because my wife and kids had been in town campaign and recently with us, she called me, I was done at five o'clock from all our events. And so she's like, 'I'm thinking about taking the kids to Cracker Barrel.' And that obviously, in the southeast is like a big deal. But I told her, I said, 'Wait a minute, I've talked to all the people here in Iowa, they all say Machine Shed is the place to go.' So we ended up doing Machine Shed. First of all, it was excellent, but they have a whole bunch of gifts and everything to do. So my son found an Iowa State football field checkerboard. And he was so obsessed with this. So he's learned how to play checkers because of that thing. So now he's like, he's always talking about Iowa State.","","",""

Des Moines, IA - Ron DeSantis joined Jason Chaffetz live on The Ingraham Angle. The highlights are below. Watch the full interview HERE. On Nikki Haley's Civil War gaffe: Well, it was a massive word salad. I still don't understand what she was trying to say with that, or why she would have gone down that road. I don't know. Look, we're Republicans. The Republican Party was founded to oppose slavery and its expansion. And the reason slavery got abolished in the United States was because of the Republican Party, and the election of Abraham Lincoln, in what happened in the ensuing years. And I'm glad that the role of the Republican Party played in exterminating slavery from the United States. That made us more in line with the values that the country was founded on-- that we're all entitled to God given rights, and we should be treated equally under the law. But I do think what it showed is...I think she says things when she gets off script. She tends to make big mistakes. The media has really given her a free pass for the last six weeks, trying to pump her up. But I think the more and more voters see that-- it's one thing to read off a teleprompter. It's one thing to read talking points. But you're going to have to be able to actually speak from a position of conviction. And you either understand the foundations of America, or you don't. I have a firm understanding that our rights come from God, not from the government and the purpose of government is to protect the rights we already possess. And so everything I do is seen through the prism of our nation's founding principles. On Donald Trump being removed from the ballot in Maine: The idea that one bureaucrat in an executive position can simply unilaterally disqualify someone from office, that turns on its head every notion of constitutional due process that this country has always abided by for over 200 years. It opens up Pandora's Box. Can you have a Republican Secretary of State disqualify Biden from the ballot because he's led in 8 million people illegally in a massive invasion, including from enemies of our country? Places like Iran, China, and the Middle East have poured in with his knowledge and assent basically. So it really opens up Pandora's box. I don't think that this ultimately will be legally sustained by the US Supreme Court. But I do think that this is going to be a constant throughout the election year where there's going to be different parts of these legal cases that are going to be front and center. I think that we win when we hold Biden accountable and talk about the issues that matter to the American people. So I think the Democrats, they want the election to be about all these other issues, they do not want to face accountability for their failed policies. On draining the swamp and holding bureaucrats accountable: One of the reasons I'm running is because the midterm election showed while Republicans failed throughout most of the country in Florida, we won the biggest victory in the history of the state for Republican running for governor. I think that a guy like me as the nominee will be able to keep the focus on Biden, keep the focus on the Democrats failures. But then more importantly, after you win the election, start holding these people accountable who have weaponized the legal system to go after their political enemies. And that starts with on day one, firing somebody like Jack Smith, that goes to dealing with people who are violating constitutional rights at the state and local government area. Republicans have turned a blind eye to abuses of power for far too long. We need to actually do something about it. In Florida, we've actually done things. We've held people accountable. And we've drained the swamp in a major way. We need that in the United States. On fighting the Miami teacher's union: Well, one, they are partisan organizations. Now they're trying to use our schools to impose a left-wing agenda. That's totally unacceptable. What we did in Florida is we said no automatic deduction of union dues, so if someone wants to join, they can write a check and hand it over. What that's done is that's caused fewer people to want to join. So down in Miami Dade County, massive urban school district, massive teacher union, historically very powerful, they failed to get the requisite 60%. So they are now going to be decertified. That is going to put more power in the hands of parents. It's going to be good for students. And here's the thing, I don't need the unions to do things for education. I've done billions of dollars and pay increases for teachers. I'm happy to support our teachers. But we don't want the union's political agenda polluting our schools.","","",""

And what I think of the Civil War, what was the cause of the Civil War. Of course the Civil War was about slavery. We know that. That's unquestioned, always the case. We know the Civil War was about slavery. But it was also more than that. It was about the freedoms of every individual. It was about the role of government. For 80 years, America had the decision and the moral question of whether slavery was a good thing and whether government, economically, culturally, any other reasons, had a role to play in that. By the grace of God, we did the right thing and slavery is no more. But the lessons of what that bigger issue with the Civil War are is that let's not forget what came out of that, which is government's role, individual liberties, freedom for every single person, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do and be anything you want to be without anyone or government getting in your way—that should be the goal of what we always try and take away from that, right? Because we never want to return back to that place. But we always want to remember the lesson of what it means to be a free individual and that everyone deserves to be a free individual. So we stand by that. I say that as a southerner. I say that as a southern governor who removed the Confederate flag off the statehouse grounds. And I say that as a proud American of how far we have come.","","",""

He blitzed from Ankeny to Marion, speaking at multiple events and participating in several interviews. Ron and Casey DeSantis started off the morning with a Parental Rights Roundtable in Ankeny. At the roundtable, they spoke with school board members and parents about the importance of letting kids be kids, protecting school choice, and supporting America's students. DeSantis was asked how he differs from Nikki Haley on these issues. He responded, ""She's driven by donors...[but] you've got to be willing to do what's right. She has no record of standing up for kids or being strong on education at all...and where has she been on all these fights we've been having?"" While speaking to reporters after the roundtable, DeSantis was asked about how Nikki Haley refused to mention slavery as a cause of the Civil War at a town hall last night in New Hampshire. He responded, ""[Haley] is not a candidate that's ready for primetime. And she's gotten a pretty free ride from a lot of the corporate press. The minute that she faces any type of scrutiny, she tends to cave and I think that that's what you saw yesterday. It's not that difficult to identify and acknowledge the role slavery played in the Civil War, and yet that seemed to be something that was really difficult. And I don't even know what she was saying. I know she's trying to clean it up. I know she's tried to blame a Democrat plant…I mean, you're gonna get asked a lot of tough questions — that's just the nature of this business. And I think that she showed time and time again that when the lights get hot that she will wilt under pressure, and that was a good example last night."" After the roundtable, DeSantis headed over to KCCI's headquarters where he sat down for an in-studio interview with political reporter Amanda Rooker. DeSantis said during the interview, ""I'm very confident that when you look at evangelical voters, I'm the guy that's delivered on issues that they care about. We've delivered on right to life, we've delivered on protecting kids from things like gender ideology. We've stood and fought for religious liberty, which of course is very important."" Watch the full segment here. Then, DeSantis traveled to Marion for the first ""Stop the Swamp"" event, held at Mr. Beans restaurant. He was joined by South Carolina State Senator Josh Kimbrell.

""It's not a difficult question."" ""Every grade-school student in the country has thought about it."" ""If you're that campaign, this is not what you want to be talking about."" TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - After a brutal night and morning of media coverage, Haley spent the beginning of her day trying to walk back her gaffe at a town hall in New Hampshire last night where she refused to mention slavery as a cause for the Civil War. Haley's cleanup attempt only made matters worse, as she claimed the reason for her gaffe was the question came from a Democrat. Here is what they are saying: Union Leader's Kevin Landrigan: @NikkiHaley on flubbing question re: slavery at Berlin town hall: ""Biden and the Democrats keep sending Democratic plants to do things like that to get the media to reax. Says ""of course the Civil War was about slavery"" but ""what it means for us today was freedom."" CNN's Andy Kaczynski:: This implies what caused the Civil War is a trick question. NBC's Sahil Kapur: ""What caused the Civil War"" is a question on the US citizenship test, which is generous in its acceptable responses, but Nikki Haley's initial answer doesn't read like it would pass (Other questions include ""name one branch of the government"" and ""how many senators are there"") NBC's Jonathan Allen: Haley says questioner was a plant. It's not a difficult question, nor is it one any SC governor in the last 150+ years has failed to consider. Every grade-school student in the country has thought about it. Calling questioner a ""plant"" gives her backers a talking point. WaPo's Josh Dawsey: The question was... what was the cause of the Civil War? CNN's Andy Kaczynski:: Worth pointing out that Haley has completely flubbed the ""what caused the Civil War"" question before - when running for governor in 2010 and speaking of the Confederacy in sympathetic terms. CNN's Eva McKend: Some context to Haley/Civil War episode...when we approached the man at the end of the event, he wouldn't give us his name, say where he was from or even confirm he was a New Hampshire resident, only telling us he had seen her prior comments on Civil War and wanted clarification CNN's Eva McKend: They really guard her. She does not frequently speak to reporters during these campaign stops... things seem to be going relatively smooth for her. And then she gets this question out of the blue from this man... He only said that he saw her answer this question about 10 years ago when she was running for governor. And he was perplexed by his her response then. ABC's Kelsey Walsh: During a town hall, @NikkiHaley was asked about the Civil War. After hearing her answer, the voter said, ""In the year 2023, it's astonishing to me that you answer that question without mentioning the word slavery."" Haley replied, ""What do you want me to say about slavery?"" CNN's Eva McKend: An awkward moment tonight at Haley town hall when she's asked about the cause of the Civil War. Haley appears taken aback by the question and then suggests the war was about ""basically how government was going to run."" Voter calls her out for refusing to mention slavery. CNN's Kaitlin Collins: Nikki Haley was asked by a voter in New Hampshire tonight about the cause of the Civil War. ""I mean, I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run. The freedoms and what people couldn't do,"" Haley answered. AP's Meg Kinnard: Haley was asked this when she ran for governor in 2010. At that time, she called it a result of ""tradition versus change."" When pressed as to what that meant, she added ""On individual rights and liberty of people."" Tonight's response seems to take it a step further. WaPo's Meryl Kornfield: Stunning moment: At a town hall in Berlin, N.H., Nikki Haley was asked by a voter what was the cause of the Civil War. She said the war was about government interfering in people's freedoms. The voter then called her out for not mentioning slavery. Atlantic's Ronald Brownstein: Seems an oddly inevitable point to reach for a candidate who, even as she has gained altitude, has become even more reluctant to confront any interest or individual more powerful in the GOP than Vivek Mark Levin: Honestly, incredibly ignorant answer. It's embarrassing. Miranda Devine: [emoji] National Review's Michael Brendan Dougherty: Best parts about Haley's dumb Civil War answer: 1) Clearly communicates her unease and lack of touch with Republican electorate. 2) Clearly communicates she doesn't realize that in New Hampshire she's campaigning to win votes from Independents and Democrats. Joel Weingart: Haley last night: ""What do you want me to say about slavery?"" Omfg NH Journal: Haley: Civil War Question Was Democrat Plant Telegraph: Nikki Haley's first mistake may prove fatal AP: Nikki Haley, asked what caused the Civil War, leaves out slavery.

Semafor's Shelby Talcott: This is a prime example of it being problematic. And Nikki Haley has historically been very careful about staying clear with her talking points and bringing everything back to what she wants to say. And in an example like that, like this, you can't do that. And it is surprising to me on one hand, that she didn't answer off the cuff and go into the slavery discussion, because it seems so simple when you're watching that clip. And she is an experienced politician. And I think that this is a this is something that could affect her presidential campaign. CNN's Jessica Dean: If you're that campaign, this is not what you want to be talking about. Right now. It is taking away from your main storyline... And so politically it is it is distracting, you get to the actual context of it and the substance of that question, and then you have to ask the deeper questions, which is why couldn't she just say that slavery was a part of why the Civil War was fought. CNN's Poppy Harlow: Something that doesn't need any context. It just is. The testimony of the college presidents a couple of weeks ago - it's context dependent. And in that answer, she said government is not meant to be, quote all things to all people. But the criticism of her has been, you're trying to be all things to all people. And it seems like that's what happened here. Semafor's Shelby Talcott: Yeah, and again, this is also allowing opposing campaigns to bring up her history in South Carolina with the Confederate flag, which is something that she has really avoided talking about on the campaign trail, but that's been Nikki Haley's problem. The main criticism that I've heard on the campaign trail from people who don't want to vote for is they feel like she's a little bit wishy washy, and they feel like she has flipped sides a little bit too much. And as you said, tries to be everything for everyone. And that's just not what you can be at this stage running a presidential campaign. You have to have specific positions and you have to lay them out clearly. Fox and Friends' Joey Jones: You're running for president, you have to see questions like that coming.","","",""

Des Moines, IA - Before the holidays, Ron and Casey DeSantis sat down with Newsmax's Bianca de la Garza for a Christmas special that dived into their faith, family traditions, and hopes for the year ahead. The highlights are below. Watch part one HERE, part two HERE, part three HERE, and part four HERE. On the real reason for the Christmas season: Particularly as we're in this Christmas season, so much of its commercialized now, but he [Jesus] ultimately is the reason for the season. And that's something that's very important to our family. And it's important, you know, with our kids, to bring them up in that tradition. On the importance of their marriage and being each other's best friend: RON DESANTIS: My wife's my best friend. Our kids are kind of our focus in terms of what we do with life. We're very busy. I mean, just being governor is very busy. Obviously, being a candidate is busy. So the question is, when you're not doing those types of things, what do you want to do with your time? We want to spend it with our family. BIANCA: Casey, Ron told me earlier on the campaign bus that you're his best friend. And I know some folks have used your relationship and say you're too insulated and try to use it as a negative. What do you say to those folks? CASEY DESANTIS: The people who are criticizing us are the people who are saying that we, what, shouldn't be spending time with our family and our seven, five, and three year old's? Like there is a, you know, folks who want to go up to Washington because they like the cocktail class circuit, and they like to get, you know, in friendly with the lobbying corps. And they criticized him for coming home, in Washington when he was serving, to come call his family or go back to his office so he could talk to us and talk to his family. And so, you know, I just reject that. And I think it's absolutely ridiculous. On campaigning with the kids: We've brought the kids along a lot just because we just want to spend time with them, but they've been very well behaved. You know, they come out, sometimes we'll put them on the spot. We'll be on the stage, we'll get introduced as a family, and we'll ask you know, our three year old do you want to say anything, and she'll say, God bless Iowa or something like that. Our five year old son, he knows football very well. I had him up on the stage in Sioux City the morning of the Michigan/Iowa Big 10 championship game. And I put him on the spot. I didn't choreograph this. I said ''Mason, who's going to win Michigan versus Iowa? And as I'm putting the mic in front of him, I'm thinking to myself, this is a bunch of Iowa fans. If he says Michigan, he's going to get booed as a five-year-old. And he came through and he said Iowa, and everyone started cheering. So yeah, we've had a lot of fun with them. On his optimism for the future: I think that as we end this year, there's so many problems that we see, we've discussed some of them, with this country. There's a lot of pessimism out there. But having gone through, being in Iowa, being in some of these states, talking to people, you know, there is a basic decency in this country. There's patriotism, people are God-fearing. That's the backbone of America. The ingredients for a great comeback are there, and so I'm optimistic about the future. I know there's a lot of work that needs to be done, but we absolutely can reverse this decline and usher in a revival of the American spirit.","","",""

The 30-second spot highlights various media reports acknowledging Haley's advantage over the president in head-to-head matchups, defeating Biden by more than both the Republican primary front runner former President Donald Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL). Titled ""Strong and Proud,"" the new Haley ad debuted in the Hawkeye State on broadcast, cable, and digital platforms. In a new Wall Street Journal poll, Haley beat Biden in a head-to-head 2024 matchup by an overwhelming 17 points, 51% to 34%. Trump also defeated Biden, but by only four points, 47% to 43%. DeSantis only managed to tie Biden at 45% each. ""It's no secret Democrats are rooting for Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis in the Republican presidential race,"" said Haley campaign spokeswoman Olivia Perez Cubas. ""After all, Trump and DeSantis barely beat Biden or lose to him, while Nikki Haley trounces Biden in the general election. Voters are rallying to Nikki because they know she is a winner."" In the latest Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll, Trump maintained his strong lead over the primary field, with 51% support among likely Republican caucusgoers. DeSantis, whose campaign has spent the last few months focused on Iowa, saw 19% in the survey, just three points above Haley's 16%. Despite Trump's strong lead, only about half of likely Republican caucusgoers, 49%, said their minds are made up as to who they're supporting. On the other hand, 46% said they could be convinced to support another candidate. In the poll's signature ""footprint"" metric, which accounts for those who say a candidate is their first or second choice and whether they are actively considering them, the race looks much closer with Trump at 76%, DeSantis at 67%, and Haley at 52%. As the days and weeks until the Iowa caucuses wind down, candidates are making their final bids to win Republican voters in the state. While strategists and political scientists have said both Trump and DeSantis are dependent on first-place finishes by significant margins, due to Haley's positioning in New Hampshire and South Carolina, she stands to benefit potentially from finishing either second or third in the caucuses. During Haley's latest push in the state, her campaign has emphasized not only her upward polling trend in the primary field but her stature against Biden in a potential 2024 matchup. Haley's Iowa effort is also aided by the recent endorsement of billionaire Charles Koch-tied Americans for Prosperity Action, an expansive grassroots organization already mobilized in Iowa and other early nominating states. The network of activists quickly began organizing for Haley following the endorsement, with AFP revealing it's reached more than 300,000 Iowa voters in the weeks since. The former U.N. ambassador also made a last-minute Iowa hire in communications adviser Pat Garrett, who previously worked for both Gov. Kim Reynolds (R-IA) and Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird. Reynolds notably endorsed DeSantis, while Bird has given Trump her support. The late addition to Haley's team will lead the campaign's media effort in Iowa in the crucial last push ahead of the caucuses. The Iowa caucuses will take place Jan. 15.","","",""

Now, I am an active caucus organizer who is no stranger to the presidential campaign cycle. I've worked alongside many campaigns and those know my endorsement isn't something easily won over or decided on a whim. I study candidates, look at their record, and listen to them on the stump — then I make my decision. On that day, my decision was clear. Nikki Haley is the whole package. Conservative, tough, strong, and forward focused. She's committed to making America strong by building up our military. She isn't blind to the threats America faces abroad and she has a plan to combat them. She's an accountant who has balanced a checkbook and understands the value of a dollar. Ultimately, it was Haley's commitment to saving and protecting unborn children that clinched my endorsement. As the former president of the Iowa Right to Life, I have devoted my career to fighting for our children. I want a nominee who can talk about protecting life in a way that brings more people into the cause, rather than pushing people away. Ultimately, we will save babies and help moms by persuading people that life — all life — is worthy of protection and love. I understand how personal this issue is for every woman and man. We must have a president who can empathetically communicate a pro-life position without compromising their beliefs. Nikki Haley is the only candidate who can do that. Nikki is a mom who openly talks about the trouble she had having her two children. Her husband was adopted and she talks about how grateful she is to have Michael in her life. Pregnancy is a deeply personal issue for every woman and man — especially women. It is life changing in all the best ways. We need a pro-life leader who can talk with people, not at people. We need a president who can unite our divided Congress to pass pro-life bills. Ultimately, Haley believes that we can save more babies and help more moms by humanizing the issue, instead of demonizing it. As South Carolina governor, Nikki did just that. She signed pro-life legislation protecting babies from the point in time in which they can feel pain. She launched a ""Birth Outcomes Initiative"" aimed at reducing infant mortality and improving birth outcomes. Her administration oversaw a program to help first-time vulnerable moms by pairing them with nurses to guide and support them. Nikki Haley is 100% pro-life, but leadership is not just about what you believe. It's about how you communicate those beliefs to bring out the best in people. This caucus season, Iowans have a choice to move on from the chaos of the past and pick a new generational leader. I will tell you what I told everyone in the audience that day: Don't look at the polls or what the media is telling you because that is how we lose. In 2024, America can't afford to lose. I challenge Iowans to think about who will be the best for our state and our country. Let that guide your decision making. Iowa, it's time to be bold. It's time to have courage. It's time to elect Nikki Haley to be the next president of the United States. Marlys Popma served twice as president of Iowa Right to Life, was the founding executive director of the Iowa Family Policy Center, now known as the Family Leader and served twice as the executive director of the Republican Party of Iowa.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370081",6267,"By: Nikki HaleyOnline here I've seen antisemitism. I confronted it every day at the United Nations. And I know that the Jew-haters try to hide it by saying they only hate Israel. All it takes is 24 hours at the UN to realize that anti-Zionism is just a modern name for the ancient evil of antisemitism. The worst-kept secret at the UN is that antisemitism is operating just beneath the surface. I saw it in my first few days on the job as US ambassador to the UN, after I met with Israel's ambassador. I broke with precedent, putting Israel ahead of many countries that US ambassadors typically meet with first. For me, it was more important to show my support for Israel, one of America's closest allies and dearest friends. The UN's anti-Israel bias, antisemitism, and what it leads to The broader UN views Israel differently. How could I possibly call Israel a friend? They think Israel is a pariah, different somehow from every other country. But what, exactly, makes the world's only Jewish state different? When you put the question like that, it answers itself. No other country is treated like Israel. The UN Security Council had a monthly meeting on ""the situation in the Middle East,"" which was clearly designed to attack Israel. I refused to go along, using the meeting to discuss the actual situation in the Middle East – Iran's ambitions, Syria's brutality, and the evil of ISIS. Yet while I covered real threats and crises, other countries singled out Israel for things it doesn't do. It's accused of oppressing Palestinians, despite being the only democracy in the Middle East – one that respects the rights of Arabs, Jews, and anyone else who lives within its borders. For that matter, Israel is singled out for things that every country does. Only Israel is denounced for choosing its capital. Only Israel is censured for defending itself from rocket attacks and suicide bombers. Apparently, it would be better if Jews let themselves be killed. The double standard clearly indicates something deeper at work – something far more hateful. This veiled antisemitism continues to this day. Last year, the UN General Assembly passed 15 resolutions condemning democratic Israel. It passed 13 resolutions condemning all other countries combined, in a world that includes murderous tyrannies like North Korea, Communist China, and Vladimir Putin's Russia. Then there's the so-called UN Human Rights Council. It has a standing agenda item devoted solely to Israel. No other country gets that kind of treatment. We withdrew the US from the Council because it tolerates and even celebrates antisemitism and blatant human rights abusers. We also pulled out of UNESCO, which denies Jewish heritage, even as it claims to protect diverse cultures. And then there's UNRWA, which we stopped funding with American taxpayer money. UNRWA teaches Palestinian children to despise the Jews. Now we know exactly where that leads. October 7, 2023. Before Hamas's initial assault was over, anti-Zionists were already trying to justify the killing spree. It was the worst slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. Only an antisemite could defend or apologize for such obvious evil. And it's now clear that antisemitism, masquerading as anti-Zionism, is far more widespread than most people realized. It's on college campuses. It's in major cities across the West. It's even in parts of the US Congress. When students, doctors, and elected officials praise Hamas for fighting the ""oppressors"" and ""colonialists,"" they're tacitly saying it's fine to kill Jews. When they say, ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,"" they're essentially advocating another Holocaust. I hope that most people who say these things don't realize that. But I fear that many know exactly what they're saying. Israel exists to protect the Jews. That's why its enemies call for Israel's destruction. Now is the time to confront this evil worldview with moral clarity and unapologetic action. We need university presidents who denounce the anti-Zionist charade. We need business executives who refuse to hire people who condone violence against Jews. And yes, we need elected leaders who stand with Israel. That starts with the president of the United States. We don't need a leader who promises to fight antisemitism while failing to condemn anti-Zionism, like the current president. We shouldn't have rejoined the UN Human Rights Council and UNESCO or restarted funding for UNRWA, which happened in the past three years. And under no circumstances should we be silent or timid in the face of antisemites in elected office, like Joe Biden has been with his fellow Democrats. Evil is evil, and it must be called out or else it will spread. The Jewish people – and the Jewish state – are at greater risk today than at any point in the past 75 years. They need America to lead the fight against antisemitism, in all its forms. It's time to make clear in federal law that anti-Zionism is antisemitism, pull the tax status of universities and nonprofits that engage in Jew-hatred, and permanently end all taxpayer support for international bodies that stoke this evil. There should be no doubt that America stands with Israel. We should give Israel everything it needs to defeat those who would destroy it, starting with Hamas. The stakes are clear. The Jewish state needs to exist because the Jewish people have a right to survive. Two years ago, in the wake of Israel's last war with Hamas, I traveled to Israel's border with Gaza. I went to Sderot. I walked through Ashkelon. As I stood outside a home that had been destroyed by terrorist rockets, a woman walked out of the rubble. She started yelling. Then she started running toward me. She threw her arms around me, hugged me, and invited me into the ruins of her home. She showed me where she was when the rockets hit. She was holding her baby grandson when she was thrown against the wall. I could see the outline of where they hit it. Her hair was embedded in the plaster. It's a miracle she survived. Two years later, that woman is still in mortal danger. Her life is threatened by those who hate the Jewish people and the Jewish state. We owe it to her, and so many others, to ensure that evil never wins – no matter what name it goes by.","","",""

Support for Haley has doubled since the last poll, while Trump is holding steady. It's important to note that this poll was conducted five and six days after Gov. Chris Sununu's endorsement of Haley. There's a big gap separating Trump and Haley from the rest of the pack. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is at 12%, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is at 6%, and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is at 5%.

The bottom line is that this could be one of the first signs that the Republican primary is entering a more dynamic phase after being relatively frozen in place for several months.

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis joined Fox News' Harris Faulkner on The Faulkner Focus today. The highlights are below. Watch the full interview HERE. On his strong support in Iowa during the closing stretch before the caucus: We have accumulated tens of thousands of people who have committed to caucus for us. We're adding more every day. I was at an event outside Iowa City, and we were able to get a bunch more people. I will do an event right after this interview and keep doing it. We'll keep doing that and have the best organization that's ever been done in Iowa. We are doing what I set out to do in terms of amassing this support. But Iowans want to see you, ask questions, and shake your hand. When you are on the ground here. I know people do polls. A lot of polls haven't done well in predicting an actual caucus because I think it is a different beast. But there is a lot of fluidity, I mean, there are a lot of people who haven't made up their mind. I would say, probably close to half could still change their mind or fully make up their mind. So, I think the last stretch, once we turn the new year will be very impactful. We're in the position to capture all that energy. On how a President DeSantis would end the invasion at our southern border: Declare it to be a national emergency, send military down there, shut off the invasion, build the border wall, and declare the Mexican drug cartels to be foreign terrorist organizations. They're poisoning tens of thousands of our citizens every year, killing them. We're going to use lethal force against them, and we're going to win that fight. On making the 2024 election a referendum on Biden's failed policies: Well, what's keeping a Republican state from saying Biden shouldn't be on the ballot? He let 8 million illegal aliens into this country. Maybe we can say that is an insurrection or rebellion. So what the Colorado Court did had no precedent in American history, and it's not something that's going to be upheld by the Supreme Court. But ultimately, what we want this election to be about, it is not about the January 6, or all the legal issues and all the controversy that's swirling around the former president. What we want the election to be about is the failures of Joe Biden, what we're going to do to turn the country around. That's how we frame the election to win. I think the Democrats would like nothing more than to keep doing all this legal stuff and make 2024 just a referendum on all the trials and everything else that's out there. It's not fair. It's politically motivated. But the Democrats are going to use that to their advantage. There's no question that this Colorado thing, I think it'll be reversed, but that's just the opening salvo. I think they're going to come with a lot more stuff, and that's going to be really a storyline as we get into '24.","","",""

The Make America Great Again Inc.'s commercial was its first in New Hampshire since June, and followed multiple polls showing Haley pulling away from the rest of the GOP field in second place here, though she was still well behind Trump. ""MAGA Inc. remains committed to exposing the career politicians who are undeserving of the Republican nomination,"" said Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the group. ""Nikki Haley has lied to increase taxes, she has lied to get in the race, and she will try to lie to win it. We won't let another tax-and-spend politician try to fool the voters."" Within hours Tuesday, Haley's own Super PAC, Stand for America, released a seven-figure ad which responds to the attack and will air on New Hampshire TV stations. ""Of all the Republicans running for president, why is Donald Trump only attacking Nikki Haley? Because Trump knows Haley's the only one who can beat him,"" the narrator begins in the 30-second ad. The spot closes with Sununu and Haley waving at supporters during the pair's three-day endorsement tour of the state last week. Trump and Haley are not expected to campaign in the state before Christmas. They each are campaigning this week in Iowa, the state holding the first caucus on Jan. 15, eight days before New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary. The Trump-backed Super PAC bought its ad to air on the CBS-TV affiliate in Boston that broadcasts through much of the state; a national CBS News poll last weekend had Haley coming within 15% of Trump in the Granite State, 44% to 29%. Last September, Haley said if elected that she would eliminate the federal gas tax, which is 18 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24 cents for diesel. ""And we don't need a federal gas tax to fund our roads,"" Haley said during that speech at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester. ""We'll keep building our roads with the trillions Washington still has, and we'll stop diverting money to green giveaways. Road money should build roads, not bike paths and hiking trails."" Haley campaign: Trump toyed with fed gas tax hike in 2018 The pro-Trump ad begins with a promise Haley made during a speech in 2013. ""I will not, not now, not ever, support raising the gas tax,"" Haley said. The narrator then states, ""Twenty four months later Haley flipped. 'Let's increase the gas tax 10 cents,''' Haley said in an address to the Legislature in January 2015. ""That's right, high-tax Haley broke her promise ... New Hampshire can't afford Nikki high tax Haley,"" the pro-Trump ad concludes. In 2013, Haley did shoot down a standalone gas tax hike, pushed by legislative leaders and industry groups. Then in early 2015, she called for raising the gas tax by 10 cents over three years, coupled with a plan to cut the top income tax bracket from 7% to 5% over a decade. The Legislature balked at that tradeoff, and the 16-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax remained in place until she left as governor in January 2017 to become Trump's ambassador to the United Nations. Then four months later, the South Carolina Legislature passed an infrastructure improvement plan that raised its state gasoline tax in two-cents-a-gallon annual increments through mid-2022. The 75% tax hike became law after lawmakers overrode Republican Gov. Henry McMaster's veto of the measure. The Haley campaign pointed out that in 2018 Trump told congressional leaders that he was open to raising the federal gas tax by as much as 25 cents a gallon to support an infrastructure package. After conservatives reacted strongly against the plan, Trump dropped the idea and never pursued it before Congress. Leavitt responded that as a South Carolina lawmaker Haley voted for a sales tax increase in 2006. The law included a 100% homeowner, property tax exemption and had cut the sales tax on unprepared foods.","","",""

Now, Trump is running false, negative ads against Haley. It looks like Donald Trump is getting nervous. Trump is recycling the same debunked lies peddled by Ron DeSantis—another sign of his desperation. Nikki Haley never supported a stand alone gas tax increase. In fact, then-Gov. Haley killed the gas tax hike pushed by the South Carolina legislature and industry groups. This claim has already been fact-checked and declared false by conservatives and independent analysts. A tax expert with Americans for Tax Reform called the charge ""incomplete"" and misleading."" The New York Times fact-checker said, ""Ms. Haley did not increase the gas tax as governor. She resisted calls to raise the gas tax as a stand-alone measure."" Do you know who supported a stand-alone gas tax increase? Drumroll please.... Donald J. Trump. That's right. In 2018, Trump endorsed a 25-cent gas tax hike but was shot down by conservatives.  ""Donald Trump's false attack ad sends a loud and clear message: Nikki Haley is surging and Trump is scared,"" said Haley spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. ""If Trump wants to talk about how he supported a 25-cent gas tax increase, he can show up to the Iowa debate on January 10."" FACTS Haley adamantly opposed a standalone gas tax increase as governor.  In 2014, when members of the legislature were pushing to increase the gas tax, Haley shot them down. Despite pressure from the Chamber of Commerce, the Trucking Association, and the legislature, Haley explained that she opposed a gas tax increase because she believes funding for infrastructure can be generated without raising taxes and businesses looking to come to South Carolina pay attention to the state's lower tax. Haley introduced a roads plan that would ONLY increase the gas tax if it was tied to income tax rate cuts. It was a net tax cut that was supported by Grover Norquist, head of the anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform In January 2015, Haley introduced a roads plan that would ONLY raise the gas tax if the legislature agreed to cut South Carolina's income tax rate (the highest in the Southeast) from 7 to 5 percent over 10 years. The proposed tax cut was more than five times the size of the proposed increase, with taxpayers netting almost $5.6 billion in savings over 10 years. Haley's tax cut plan died in the legislature. Gas taxes were NOT increased under her tenure. Haley is the only presidential candidate who has called for eliminating the federal gas and diesel tax.   Haley's Freedom Plan calls for repealing the federal gas and diesel tax.  Donald Trump called for increasing the gas tax as president. In 2018, Trump endorsed a 25-cent gas tax increase as part of his infrastructure plan. He was shot down by conservatives. Analysts say this bird-brained idea would wipe out 60% of the benefits for individuals from Trump's tax cuts.","","",""

""That's the fake news. There is no 'surge,'"" Trump said. ""Where is the 'surge?'"" On Sunday, a new CBS News poll showed Haley's support in the Granite State has grown from 11 percent in September to 29 percent today, while Trump's has slipped from 50 percent to 44 percent. Trump's lead over Haley is now down to 15 points in New Hampshire, and that has got local Haley supporters using the ""S"" word. ""I think this poll shows the surge, the momentum that started after the first debate,"" said former state Rep. Kim Rice. ""And it isn't showing any sign of slowing down."" Also notable: News of Gov. Chris Sununu's endorsement of Haley broke on Dec. 12, while the CBS News poll was conducted between Dec. 8-15. That means some of this momentum shift occurred before the Sununu endorsement. Not that Sununu is holding back his enthusiasm, predicting on ABC News on Sunday that Haley will win the Granite State ""in a landslide."" ""It's an absolute win. No, it's a win and a reset button,"" Sununu told ABC's Jonathan Karl. ""If everyone that could vote in the primary comes out and votes … she's gonna win in a landslide, and that's not an exaggeration."" Haley's campaign is hoping to build on that momentum by announcing 50 new Granite State endorsements. Among them are three former GOP House Speakers: Donna Sytek, Gene Chandler, and Doug Scamman. Also on the list are two former state GOP chairs, Steve Duprey and Wayne Semprini. ""Over the past year, Granite Staters have had a front-row seat to Nikki Haley's rise, and they love what they're seeing,"" former State Sen. Jim Luther said in a statement. ""She'll revive the middle class, protect our homeland, stand strong against our enemies, and restore our national pride. There's no doubt that Nikki is campaigning the New Hampshire way, and everyone's taking notice.""' Craig Stevens of Bedford served in the George W. Bush administration and worked on the Bush and Mitt Romney campaigns. He is among the Granite Staters who are now backing Haley. ""Ambassador Haley has the experience and temperament Americans need to lead our country,"" Stevens said. ""She beats President Biden in a walk and finally allows our nation to reset with a new generation of leadership. And at the top of the Republican ticket, she expands the party's base and helps our candidates down ballot."" Haley's not the only candidate picking up endorsements.

That's when you've got to stand strong."" Des Moines, IA - Amidst his fourth full day in a row in Iowa, Ron DeSantis joined KFAB's NewsRadio 1110 with Emery Songer and WHO's The Simon Conway Show. The highlights are below. Listen to the full interview on KFAB radio here. On his proven record of winning against the left: Iowans want to see the country turned around. They want to see results. They're sick of the rhetoric. We've had so many Republicans get elected, they promise they're going to do this stuff, and nothing ever gets done. I have a record in Florida of delivering on 100% of my promises. If you look at all the things that are plaguing this country, the people that are responsible for that, I've beat them in Florida, whether it's on education, on crime, whether it's on beating Fauci on COVID, so we deliver. And I think they really want to see leadership on the border, on the economy, on reining in the bureaucracy and the administrative state. All these things that we know are a problem for this country, but we actually need to bring it in for a landing and get it done. And so I'm somebody that has a proven record of fighting for the people I represent. I have a record of winning big, not just with elections, but winning big on all these important issues. And then leading the charge, you've got to have vision, you've got to press forward, even when they're shooting at you. That's when you've got to stand strong. That's what we'll do, and that's what we'll do as president. On the impact of Kim Reynolds' historic endorsement: Well, it's huge. She's universally respected by Republican Iowa caucus-goers. When she says things like 'Governor DeSantis is the most effective leader she's seen,' that's important. That's a vote of confidence. She brings, of course, a whole organization to bear that she is now activating the turnout for us in the caucus. And I do think that there's a great relationship, in terms of policy success, between both Iowa and Florida. And I don't think it's any coincidence that as Republicans were flopping all around the country with the candidates that just couldn't get the job done, Iowa and Florida did deliver red waves. In fact, our wave in Florida was historic. It was the greatest Republican victory in Florida history in a governor's race. We swept in super majorities of the legislature, school boards, county commissions, the whole nine yards. It was an epic victory. Listen to the full interview on WHO radio here. On the top two top issues he will address on day one as president: The border has been one of the grossest derelictions of duty that any President has had in the modern history of our country...they've let in 8 million people illegally. We have fentanyl pouring into every community killing tens of thousands of our fellow citizens. And as bad as Biden's been, it has to be said, Republicans have been complaining about the border for years and years. I'll be the president to finally bring an end to the problem. We will have military on the border, it'll be declared a national emergency on day one, we'll send back to people that Biden let in in particular, I'll build the border wall -- because if Trump had built the wall, Biden would not have led been able to let in this many people -- and we're going to hold the drug cartels accountable. So I think those two issues, and part of how you deal with the inflation and the interest rates is Biden and Congress are spending way too much money. We've got to go back to more reasonable levels of spending. I'll be a president that will lean in on that. We will get the interest rates down, which is going to be important for families to be able to afford homes. We are going to open up all energy for production domestically. That's going to lower energy costs. That influences prices and inflation in a positive way for consumers, and it makes our country more secure. And then things like the Green New Deal, enforcing electric vehicles, we're going to rip that up and throw that out on day one. On the importance of securing the border to protect Americans: I think the danger is when you have 8 million people coming illegally, do you not think that our enemies are not going to take advantage? Of course they are. We know people from China, Iran, other places in the Middle East have come through , and in pretty large numbers. So there's absolutely a high risk of terrorism as a result of what's happened. I think that the FBI and federal agencies, they need to stop worrying about politics, censorship, weaponizing their power, and they need to really focus on the bread and butter of what we need these agencies to be doing. And that's interdicting things like terrorism. But I think there's a high probability that there will be an attack that will be linked to the southern border. I can't tell you if it's going to happen tomorrow, or a year from now, or five years from now. But there's no way you can have that many people in here from so many countries that want to do us harm and not have people who are inclined to do that, and not have people who were sent for that reason. So I think it's a total disaster. I think our citizens are much less secure as a result of what Biden has done at the southern border. And the thing about all this is our adversaries, they look for ways where there's a lot of bang for the buck in order to trip us up. They do a lot of stuff on cyber, which is, you know, something we're always combating. Something like coming, sending people to the border, that's easy for them. That's a very low-cost option to be able to do that. A terrorist group, no problem. They are taking advantage of us, and our country's less safe as a result.","","",""

Now, Donald Trump is recycling Ron DeSantis' debunked lies about Nikki Haley's tax record. Fact checkers have said the attack is misleading and false. Let's review: PolitiFact: A MAGA Inc. ad in New Hampshire states that Nikki Haley ""flipped"" on the gas tax and calls her ""high tax Haley."" We fact-checked a similar ad's statement that Haley ""raised taxes"" and rated it Mostly False. The Washington Post: While the ad targets a major concern for conservative voters, tax increases, it's based on a misleading claim that's been frequently used by GOP campaigns this cycle — that Haley as governor of South Carolina supported a gas-tax hike. Haley opposed a stand-alone gas tax increase as governor. In 2015, she proposed raising the gas tax only if the state reduced income tax rates from 7 percent to 5 percent. The plan, her campaign pointed out on Tuesday, died in the state legislature and gas taxes were not increased during her time in office. Forbes: Nikki Haley did not propose a standalone gas tax hike during any of her six years in the South Carolina governor's mansion. It was Republican state lawmakers at the time who first proposed and drove the push for a gas tax increase. In response to the effort to raise South Carolina's gas tax, then-Governor Haley countered by telling state legislators she would only consider a gas tax increase if it were tied to an income tax cut of greater size. Underscoring how misleading it is to brand Haley as a tax hiker is a 2015 letter sent from Americans For Tax Reform president Grover Norquist to South Carolina legislators, urging them to support then-Governor Haley's proposed income tax cut, noting that its benefits would outweigh the costs of any gas tax hike tied to it. The Hill: The ad, released Tuesday, slams Haley for appearing to go back on a 2013 South Carolina gubernatorial campaign promise to not raise the gas tax. Her campaign denied that she ever supported raising the South Carolina gas tax while governor. PolitiFact labeled the gas tax claims ""mostly false."" Haley did advocate for raising the gas tax in 2015, but only alongside a cut in the income tax. Her proposal did not pass. New York Times: The Fight Right ad also cites an article by Fox Business in the fall about Ms. Haley and South Carolina's gas tax — the subject of misleading claims by another pro-DeSantis super PAC. Ms. Haley did not increase the gas tax as governor. She resisted calls to raise the gas tax as a stand-alone measure, but proposed raising the tax only if the state also reduced the income tax rate to 5 percent, from 7 percent, and made changes to the state's Transportation Department","","",""

""Nikki Haley is not somebody that conservatives have any confidence in. That's not her record. She's been cozying up to even Liberal Democrat, mega-donors on Wall Street and in California.

According to the Des Moines Register, ""Brett Barker is a triple threat: He's the mayor of the city of Nevada, he's the chair of the Story County Republican Party and he helps lead the Young Republicans of Iowa.

Who here thinks the future of our country depends on beating Joe Biden? Every single poll shows that Nikki Haley is a candidate most able to beat Joe Biden. And we aren't just talking about small margins. We're talking about margins that are about 17 points. Those types of margins we haven't seen since the Reagan era. And those would bring victory up and down the ticket all across the country. And this is the third time I've had the opportunity to introduce Ambassador Haley here in Nevada. And I've got to tell you, I've only become more impressed. ""We watched her take on the establishment in South Carolina, despite risk to her own career. We watched her stare down tyrants at the United Nations. And more recently, we watched her debate important issues on the national stage with both poise and grace. Like all of you, I've spent the last couple of years, honestly, meeting and vetting candidates. I've watched how they interact with Iowans. I've watched how they answer hard questions. And there's one that stands out. And I'm officially announcing today that I've made my decision for who I intend to caucus for on January 15, and that person is Nikki Haley.""","","",""

We need to change that, and 2024 gives us an opportunity to do so."" Des Moines, IA - Ron DeSantis and Congressman Chip Roy joined Fox News' Kayleigh McEnany live on Hannity Special. The highlights are below. Watch the full interview HERE. On his ground game in Iowa ahead of the Iowa Caucus: What we do is we accumulate people that commit to caucus for us. We have tens of thousands of people in the hopper. We're adding more every day. We just finished a great event with Chip Roy, Governor Kim Reynolds who's endorsed me, my wife Casey, we're bringing more people onto the fold... So going to all 99 counties is the right way to do it, showing up in these communities. And when you do that, when they're able to hear you and ask you questions, that's when they commit to caucus for you. So we're excited about where we are. I think we have a better head of steam than the previous winners of the caucus, and I thank for having people like Chip on board that are stirring the pot out here for us. On combatting Biden's border crisis: DESANTIS: I think the left got on this horse because they were trying to oppose everything Trump was doing back in 2016, who was pledging a border wall and border security. And so they tied themselves up into saying that they should just have an open border. When faced with the realities of that, whether it's Martha's Vineyard, whether it's New York City, whether it's Chicago, Los Angeles, they want nothing to do with the effects of an open border. The fact of the matter is you have major Democrats in this country now acknowledging you cannot have an open border. You cannot have 9 million people, 8 million people come in in a three-year period. We don't know who they are, they're imposing burdens on society, criminal aliens, fentanyl, the whole nine yards. This is probably -- and you've pointed out Biden's doing very poorly -- but of all the things he's done, this may be the biggest dereliction of duty. He has not satisfied his oath of office as president of the United States to keep this country safe. ROY: last September, it was the actions of governor DeSantis, who I'm proud to be sitting next to, and Governor Abbott that I think saved the elections for House Republicans. I think we have a majority in the House because of their leadership. And importantly, what we're seeing at the border right now with 300,000 encounters in November, December is on track for 300,000, that's 10,000 a day. For that perspective, Jeh Johnson said a thousand a day was a crisis under President Obama. This is exacting an enormous toll on Texans. I had six kids, in the school district in which my wife and my family and I live, six kids who died last year from fentanyl poisoning, ranches getting overrun, Texans dying from fentanyl poisoning. Americans are feeling it across the country. And the fact is, we have a solution. House Republicans passed H.R. 2, a strong border security bill. The key is we need to force getting it passed and force the president to sign it. And if he won't do it, we need to then elect a president who will actually sign that into law, unlike President Trump, who in 2018 was siding with Paul Ryan to try to pass an amnesty first, rather than border security first bill, which left us with the situation we're facing right now. Chip Roy on DeSantis' momentum: I'm seeing an enormous amount of enthusiasm. It's great to be here. You know, we met with a great group here. As Republican women, they're the backbone of the Republican activists out there. We've got a great tour over the next few days. My friend Thomas Massie was out here Saturday. They had some great events, great enthusiasm. Look, people are thirsty for a new generation, a new vision, looking forward, not looking backwards, somebody who can serve for eight years, somebody who won his election in Florida by an enormous margin, 1.5 million votes, won 62% of Hispanic voters, 50% of single female voters. They don't want an election that's close, where you're counting ballots singularly. They want to win by an overwhelming margin and take their country back. They're enthusiastic for Governor DeSantis. On the impact of the border crisis in Iowa: We just did a ride along with a sheriff department in Wayne County, which is a rural county in Iowa. They are seeing impacts from the narcotics that are coming in. So every community has become a border community under Joe Biden. You run into angel parents in all corners of this country now who have lost kids to fentanyl. And a lot of times, these are kids that are not addicted to drugs. Maybe they took one pill thinking it was something else, it's laced with fentanyl, and they get poisoned to death. So we have tens of thousands of deaths every year. Joe Biden doesn't seem to care about that. The elites in DC don't seem to care about it. And I think when you talk to Iowans, as well as people in New Hampshire and other early states, there's the sense that's accurate, that the people who are running this government do not care about the people that they were elected to serve. We need to change that, and 2024 gives us an opportunity to do so.","","",""

Thomas Massie. When asked about Massie's notorious record, DeSantis defended Massie. DeSantis falsely claimed that Massie is simply against foreign aid. He should take a closer look at the record. Massie routinely votes against recognizing Israel's right to exist, condemning antisemitism, cracking down on Iranian terrorism, criticizing the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, and sanctioning terrorist organizations. DeSantis-ally Thomas Massie votes with the Squad on Israel and terrorism more often than he votes with Republicans. None of that is connected to foreign aid. When Massie posted an antisemitic meme, he was denounced by Republican Jewish Coalition president Matt Brooks: ""Shame on you @RepThomasMassie. You're a disgrace to the US Congress and to the Republican Party.""

And that's who he brought to your state."" Will Ron DeSantis denounce his ally's record on these important issues?

""I'll just say it. Biden's too old, and Congress is the most exclusive nursing home in America,"" the former South Carolina governor who later served as ambassador to the United Nations during the Trump administration argues at the top of her commercial, which was shared first with Fox News on Monday. Haley declared her candidacy for the White House in early February, but didn't launch her first TV ads until the beginning of this month. The new spot is the third commercial in her ongoing $10 million ad blitz in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote in the GOP presidential nominating calendar. ""We have to leave behind the chaos and drama of the past with a new generation and a new conservative president,"" Haley said to the camera in the spot, swiping at the former president without mentioning his name. Haley highlighted the need for a new generation of conservative leadership when she formally launched her presidential campaign in her hometown of Charleston, South Carolina, ten months ago. She also reiterated her calls for mental competency tests for politicians age 75 and older – something she first did days into her White House bid. Haley is 51 years old, a full generation younger than 81-year-old Biden and 77-year-old Trump. Trump remains the commanding front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination in his third straight White House bid. He made history earlier this year as the first former or current president to be indicted for a crime with his four indictments, including in federal court in Washington, D.C., and in Fulton County court in Georgia on charges he tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The indictments have only boosted Trump's standing in GOP presidential nomination polls. He holds a massive 57-point lead over the rest of the remaining field of Republican rivals for the nomination in the latest Fox News national poll, which was released on Sunday. Trump's margin jumped by seven points from the previous Fox News poll conducted a month ago. Haley has enjoyed plenty of momentum in the polls in recent months, thanks in part to well-received performances in the first three GOP presidential primary debates. She leapfrogged Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for second place in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary and second overall contest in the Republican nominating calendar. She also aims to make a fight of it in Iowa, where the polls indicate DeSantis is a distant second behind Trump. Iowa's Jan. 15 caucuses are followed eight days later by New Hampshire's Jan. 23 primary. Haley landed the endorsement of New Hampshire's popular Republican Gov. Chris Sununu last week. A couple of weeks ago, she was endorsed by Americans for Prosperity Action, the political wing of the influential and deep-pocketed fiscally conservative network founded by the billionaire Koch Brothers. AFP Action has pledged to spend tens of millions of dollars and mobilize its formidable grassroots operation to boost Haley and help push the Republican Party past Trump.","","",""

I'm thrilled to be back in your incredible state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. That's what you are. And let me begin by wishing you all a very, very Merry Christmas. Very merry. Remember we had to defend that term about seven years ago. We had to defend the words, Merry Christmas. We don't have to defend it anymore. We are just seven weeks away from the Nevada presidential caucuses and on Thursday, February 8th, we are going to win the Nevada caucuses. We are then going to crush crooked Joe Biden. He is our crooked, horrible president. A horrible president. Next November, we're going to win so big, it's going to do something like you've never seen before. We are going to make America great again, even greater than we had it. During this holiday season, families all across America are struggling under the brutal weight of crooked Joe's failures, disasters, heartless betrayals, and a thing called inflation, at a level like nobody's ever seen before, while the stock market is making rich people richer. Thank you very much. Thank you. It is making rich people richer. Biden's inflation catastrophe is demolishing your savings, ravaging your dreams. His sky-high energy prices are brutalizing your wallets. Our border has been erased. We have no border any longer. Criminals are running wild in our Democrat-run cities, while Christians and conservatives are persecuted. And thanks to crooked Joe's breathtaking weakness, the world is going up in flames. The world is laughing at us. They can't blame—I tell you what, they can't blame us. This is the U.S.A. They're not blaming us. They're blaming him. He is a laughingstock all over the world. Our country is being laughed at. Joe Biden and the Democrat Party are incapable of solving any problem. There's not a problem they've been able to solve. Crooked Joe—you know this. Did you ever hear this? Crooked Joe is a low IQ individual, and he is truly the worst, most incompetent, and most corrupt president in the history of our country. In fact, Jimmy Carter is very happy because he looks like a brilliant—that was a brilliant administration by comparison to what you have right now. Very, very brilliant indeed. But with your vote in this election together, we are going to save America. We're going to bring back our country and we're going to bring it back from hell because that's where it's been. Not one thing has gotten better under crooked Joe Biden. Not one thing. Name one thing. Does anybody out there? Do you have any Biden fans? [crowd booing]. Are there any Biden fans in this big crowd? After three years of Bidenomics, he thinks the term is good—no, it's a bad term, not a good term. You know the one he doesn't like? MAGA. He talks about MAGA. It's called Make America Great Again. He doesn't like it. He doesn't like it. The average monthly mortgage payment has gone from $1,746 under my administration to $3,322 under the Biden administration. And then you have to ask, were you better off five years ago or are you better off today? You're a lot better off five years ago. And you think what a difference a president makes. Makes a big difference. I had no idea, to the extent. Frankly, I didn't realize it until well into the administration when you see all the things we did, we're going to cover them—biggest tax increase in history. When we had had the biggest tax decrease ever. Ever. Think of it—ever in history of our country. The biggest tax cut, the biggest tax decrease, in the history of our country. The biggest regulation cuts in the history of our country. The best job numbers in the history of our country. The real job numbers, not the fake job numbers that they give. The next economic boom will begin the instant the world knows that crooked Joe Biden is gone and we have four more years of President Donald J. Trump and you, and you, together. Together. But you weren't just better off financially under President Trump, you're also much, much safer when President Trump was in the White House like. I mean, how unsafe is it? Friends of mine that live here—you don't even think of it, but friends of mine that live here, they're under siege. They say their houses are being robbed. Their cars are being stolen. Who the hell thought of it? I never even thought it was here. I didn't think you had the problem here. You have it all over the country. The lawlessness is unbelievable, but we are going to give law enforcement back their authority. We're going to give it back. They have to have it back. Under our leadership you were safer, your family was safer, your communities were safer, your children were safer, your borders were safer, and your whole country was safer. A lot safer. Three years ago, we had the most secure border in US history. We built 561 miles of border wall. We got Mexico to give us, free of charge, 28,000 soldiers. Thank you very much. We ended 'catch and release.' We let our great ICE agents do their job and we deported over one million illegals in my very first term. One million, back to their country. Our border had never been stronger, but then Crooked Joe came in and he launched an invasion against our country. This is an invasion. This is like a military invasion. Drugs, criminals, gang members and terrorists are pouring into our country at record levels. We've never seen anything like it. They're taking over our cities. Under Biden, you have the highest number of illegal border crossings in the history of our country, by far the highest number of illegal visa overstays, and by far a new record being set every single week on drugs and every other lousy thing that's coming into our country. But as soon as we win the election, the momentum of our great victory will immediately begin stopping the hordes of illegal alien migrants who are charging across our border by the hundreds of thousands. Just like three years ago, the invasion will end. You know it ended with us. When we came in, it just ended. We had to do a lot of work, but it ended. We had great people. Brandon Judd, border patrol, Tom Homan. We had just unbelievable people. If they would've just left it alone. You were setting every record. They took everything we did. They didn't finish the little sections of wall. We had built it. It was there. All they had to do is put it up. They actually sold those sections of wall for 5 cents on the dollar. Can you believe it? All they had to do is put it up. But people will know that I will catch them. We will catch them. We'll catch them together. We're going to send them back. We're going to send them out of our country. Given the unprecedented millions of Biden illegal aliens who are invading our country, it is only common sense that when I'm reelected, we will begin. And we have no choice. The largest deportation operation in American history. [crowd cheering] We have no choice. Crooked Joe has left us no choice. They're coming in by the tens of—they're coming in. I believe the number by the end of this administration will be at least 15 or 16 million people. They come from prisons. They come from mental institutions and insane asylums. Many are terrorists. They're catching record numbers of terrorists, but the ones that they don't catch, those are the bigger problems because they're coming in at levels that nobody's ever seen before. This is a problem that our country's going to have. We have to take care of it very quickly and local law enforcement will help and they'll help a lot. And I want to thank them. A lot of them are here. In fact, I shook so many hands of policemen and law enforcement. This hand. They tend to have very strong hands and when you shake hundreds of them, they have very, very powerful hands. Sir, thank you very much. Thank you, sir. One guy's fingers, like sausages. Sir, do you mind if I shake your hand? Absolutely. And he's crying a little bit because he's happy. He hasn't cried since he was about one month old. Sir, do you mind if I shake? We have to save our country. May I shake your hand, sir? Yes. You go, aww. But that's okay. We do it. We do it for our country. And our country will pay a big price for this madness if we do not do what we have to do. We have to clean up our country. We have to get all the criminals. We have so many criminals being dumped into our country. I read an article recently, in a paper. It's a fake newspaper, but I assume the article was true. Most of them are, unfortunately. Look at it back there. But most of them are. [crowd booing] And it was by a man and about a man who runs a mental institution in South America. And by the way, they're coming from all over the world. They're coming from Africa, from Asia all over but this happened to be in South America, and he was sitting reading a newspaper, sort of leisurely, and they were asking him, ""What are you doing?"" ""I was very busy all my life. I was very proud. I worked 24 hours a day. I was so busy all the time. But now I'm in this mental institution,"" where he's been for years. ""And I'm in the mental institution and I worked very hard on my patients, but now we don't have any patients. They've all been brought to the United States."" This is what's happening. This is what's happening. And I read that. And you can multiply that by hundreds and even thousands of different places all over the world. They're all being dumped. We're like a dumping ground. It's not going to—it's not going to last long. You better win this election for us. You got to win it. Got to win it. Because they cheat like hell. Like they cheat, like hell. It's the only thing they do good is—they cheat on elections. For the past three years, Crooked Joe Biden and the ultra-radical left democratic extremist in Congress, have turned America into a haven for blood-thirsty criminals, savage gang members like MS-13, very nice people. We're sending them back, at levels that you've never—you know we set records on sending MS-13 back. By the thousands. We sent them back. Now they stay here in luxurious conditions. They stay here now in better conditions than our vets [veterans]. Our vets aren't treated good, but MS-13—and they send in dangerous inmates emptied out of the prisons. They come out of the prisons. They come out of, they say in the back, ""Oh, please sir, don't mention the words, insane asylum."" But they come out of insane asylums, all over the world and mental institutions. Insane asylum is a mental institution on steroids. That's Hannibal Lecter. Hannibal Lecter. You ever hear of him? Silence of the Lip. That's what we got. We got him coming in and this is not good. That's like an explosion waiting to happen. Just days ago, we learned that an illegal alien wanted for murder in Mexico, secretly violated our border and was discovered in Las Vegas. They believe he's killed two people. Last year, another sadistic, illegal alien murder with a previous criminal record went on the stabbing spree on the Las Vegas strip, killing two people and badly wounding six more badly. Badly. In Texas this month, the body of a 16-year-old high school cheerleader, you know about it. You've been reading about it, a lot, was discovered by her mother in a bathtub, legs hanging out of the bathtub, stabbed to death and murdered by an illegal alien after she missed the Christmas parade. The mother said, ""Where is she?"" The Christmas parade. She never showed up to the Christmas parade. She was killed by an illegal alien. Tens of thousands of Chinese nationals are pouring in, unchecked, unvetted going who knows where. We don't know. They have no idea. They have no idea. You know they're coming in. Twenty-seven thousand Chinese men age 20 to 24, 25. No women. No older people. No younger people. About 20 to 24, 25 years old. The perfect age for an army. Is that what they're doing? They're sending men in. So has anybody heard the snake? I mean, we have a long time. The football games are terrible. They're boring. Would anybody like to hear the snake? What the hell? Good. Just happen—we just happen to have a copy. I do this for Reno. We do it in special places, but it's a metaphor of what's going on at your border. And it's a metaphor as to what will happen in Reno, in Nevada, all over the place. It's a metaphor. It's a very accurate, an old song that we worked on a little bit, but a metaphor as to what's happening with illegal immigration and I think you'll understand it very quickly. You sure you want it? Yeah. No, people love it. They love it. I wish they didn't love it. I wish we didn't have to say it, but it's very accurate. [Reading off a paper] On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tenderhearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake. Her pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. ""Poor thing,"" she cried, ""I'll take you in and I'll take care of you."" ""Take me in, 'O tender woman. Take me in for heaven's sake. Take me in, 'O tender woman,"" cried the vicious snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk. She hurried home from work that night, and soon as she arrived, she found the pretty snake she'd taken in had been revived. ""Take me in, 'O tender woman. Take me in for heaven's sake. Take me in, 'O tender woman,"" sighed the vicious snake. She clutched him to her bosom. ""You're so beautiful."" She cried, ""but if I hadn't brought you in by now, you truly would've died."" She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed him and held him tight. But instead of saying, ""thank you, ma'am,"" the snake gave her a vicious bite. Bite, bite, bite. ""Take me in, 'O tender woman. Take me in for heaven's sake. Take me in, 'O tender woman,"" sighed the vicious snake. ""I saved you,"" cried the woman. ""And you've bitten me. But why? You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die."" ""Shut up, silly woman,"" said the reptile with a grin. ""You knew damn well I was a snake, before you took me in."" Does that remind you? Does that remind you of anything? Be ready. Be ready. Because what they're allowing into our country is very, very bad. Very, very, very bad. And I think that's about as accurate as you could get. Put in an interesting forum, right? It's a very interesting forum. Are we glad we did that? Yes. It's sad that we have to do it. Common sense would say, we should never even have to be talking about a thing like that. Who would allow people to pour into our country that are from prisons and from lots of other places that you don't want to talk about? On my first day back in the White House, I will terminate every Open Borders policy of the Biden administration, and I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members, from the United States, ending the gorge of illegal alien gang violence once and for all. You know, when I took out the MS-13, again by the thousands, we had a problem because you couldn't get them back into the various countries from where they came. And I'll never forget the people in the White House coming up to me saying that the Obama administration—has anybody ever heard of Barack Hussein Obama. Remember Rush? Barack Hussein. Remember Rush Limbaugh? He would talk about Barack Hussein Obama, Rush gave him the presidential medal of freedom. He is missed, greatly missed. Man of great common sense. Forget about conservative, liberal who cares. I mean, he was a man. We want to deal with common sense, right? We want borders. We want good education. We want low interest rates. We want a strong military. We want as fewer regulations as we can have. But you think of it, you think of it, Rush Limbaugh, so many people, we've lost so many great people. So many great people that got it. They were people of common sense. Just common sense. And that's what we need. We need common sense. We're the party of common sense, the Republican Party. You like strong borders, right? You don't want people coming in from prisons and mental institutions. I will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement, including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI and DHS, and I will make clear that we must use any and all resources needed to stop the invasion of our country, including moving thousands of troops currently stationed overseas in countries that don't like us. They laugh at our current president. They think he's a fool and we shouldn't be there. We shouldn't be there. We have to protect our own borders firs before we defend the borders of foreign countries. We have to get our act together. We have to be able to do it for ourselves. I will also use Title 42 to end the child trafficking crisis by returning all trafficked children to their families in their home countries immediately. So, these people told me though, just to finish the story, they told me that, ""Sir, you're not going to be able to bring the gang members back to their countries. They won't accept them."" Oh, that's nice. You mean they send them? Absolutely. They send them in caravans. They send them up. They dump them in our country. That's why they have empty jails. That's why their jails are—you know what they save? You know what—they don't want them for 50 years in jail or more or less. They don't want them. They don't want MS-13. They don't want these killers and murderers. So, they said, ""sir, they won't take them."" They put planes, big planes on the runway. So, when our plane comes in loaded up with people, they had to go away and they put bus stops. They put all of these stoppers, big stoppers. You blow out the tires. They have them to the ground. They pop up. They blow out the tires of our buses and vans as we bring them back into the various countries, Honduras, El Salvador, different countries, all different countries. They come from a lot of different countries. So, what happens? Guatemala, lot are from Guatemala. So, what happens is they said, ""You'll never get it back."" I said, ""How much money do we pay those countries in foreign aid."" ""Sir, we pay them $750 million."" It's a lot. You know not big compared to what some countries get stupidly, but we pay them 750 million. I said, ""Please inform them that starting tomorrow morning they're not getting any more foreign aid."" So, about an hour after we informed them, I got a call from all three of them, but separate, and they said, ""Sir, there seems to be a problem, a misunderstanding."" I said, ""Yeah, there is. For 10 years, 15 years you wouldn't take these people that you send back, and they send them, don't kid yourself. They don't want them in their country. They send them up in the caravan. You wouldn't take them back, right? And they said, ""No, that's not my understanding, but we would be very happy to talk."" I said, ""Here's the story. If you don't take them back, you'll never see anything from the United States in terms of foreign aid. Nothing."" And all three of them, they didn't even have to hang up the phone. They said, ""Sir, we would be greatly honored to take back MS-13 killers. We would greatly be honored to take back murderers and thugs of all types. This would be our great honor. We hope you're happy, sir, are you happy?"" I said, ""Yes, but I still didn't pay them the money. I held it back."" And to keep America safe from terror—that was a big deal because they wouldn't take them back. We were stuck with them and Obama and Biden—I doubt that he was very much involved, but Obama and the Obama administration, including crooked Joe Biden would not take them back, would not make any deals. All they did—all they did was accept the fact that these countries wouldn't take them back. I got a thing called a telephone. You can do a lot with a telephone. You can do a lot. I did it with France. They were going to put taxes on American companies, big taxes, and I gave it to my people and my people worked on it. They couldn't do anything. It was done. They said it was done, and my people came back. They're good people, but they aren't me and they're not you. And they came back and they said, sir. Macron, they spoke to Macron, very nice gentleman, but he's for France and he is the wise guy, but he's for France and we are for the United States of America, right? ""Sir, we spoke to Emmanuel Macron."" I said, ""Well, that's the right guy. What did he say?"" He said, ""No, this deal is done. I'm sorry. We can't do anything."" So this went on for two months and I said, ""All right, now let's handle it properly."" I called up Emmanuel Macron, head of France, absolute head of France. I said, ""Emmanuel, you're going to tax American companies. That's not fair."" ""No, no, no. It is too late to discuss this."" I said, ""Well, that's okay, but here's the story. If this goes into effect next week when it was supposed to go into effect, I am going to put a 100% tax on all wine and champagne that comes into the United States from France."" And he said, ""No, no, no. Donald, you cannot do that, Donald. That is not fair."" I said, ""That's not fair that you're taxing our companies. You're not taxing other companies."" ""No, no, no. This is not fair."" I said, ""Here's this, sir, you have 15 minutes to tell me whether or not you're going to take the tax off."" ""I will call you back, Donald."" Calls me back, ""We have decided to remove the tax, all taxes."" And my guys worked on it. They know who they are. My guys over at Treasury, they worked on it for a period of about two and a half months. I did it in two minutes, but we did many, many. I could tell you story after story like that. It's about common sense. It's about protecting our nation. It's about putting America first. Isn't it really about putting America? I will immediately restore and expand the Trump travel ban on an entry from terror plague countries, and I will implement strong ideological screening for all immigrants. If you hate America, if you want to abolish Israel, if you sympathize with Jihadists, then we don't want you in our country. We don't want you. Crooked Joe Biden puts China first, puts Asia first, puts Ukraine first, puts illegal aliens first, environmental maniacs first. Everyone else first. He puts everybody first. That's bad. But he puts America last. He puts Nevada last. He puts our workers last. He frankly puts unions last. Look what he did with the car. They're going to make all electric cars in our country, but not when I'm in there. I'll end that the first day. He puts our families last. He puts everything last that's good. I put Nevada first and I put America first every single time, and that's what we did. That's what we did. It's no wonder crooked Joe and the far-left lunatics are desperate to stop us by any means necessary. They're willing to violate the US Constitution at levels never seen before in order to win. They're dirty players. They played dirty, they weaponized justice. There are a bunch of dirty players. Look at what they're doing right here to Michael and great people in this state. It's a disgrace. Joe Biden is a threat to democracy. They're weaponizing law enforcement for high level election interference because we're beating them so badly in the polls. The Harvard Harris poll just came out today—has us leading Republican primary field by 56 points. This is leading. This is leading. This is leading by 56 points with Trump at 67%. Ron DeSanctimonious at 11, and Nikki Haley at 10, where's the surge? Where's the surge? They kept saying, ""Oh, she's surging."" She went down a point and I went up 10 points last week and they do a story that she's—and she is surging compared to him, so if you read the story, that's what they meant because I'm like 70 points above them. If you read the story, they meant she's surging compared to DeSanctimonious, but you have to read the story, but it said Haley surges compared to—not compared to me because I went up. The new Fox Poll just came up. I guess I went up like seven or eight points, nine points. She went up two points, three points, and he's either even or went down. Then they say she's surging because she went up a couple of points on him, but she went way down compared to me. I'll tell you what, the media is so fake. They're so terrible. So terrible. In addition, one just came out a little while ago, as I'm walking up, the new Clarity Poll has Trump at 74, DeSanctis at 10 and Haley at 6. In the new McLaughlin Poll of Nevada we're at 75% while DeSanctimonious is at 60 points behind us. He's at 15, so think of that, we're at 75, just came out. We're at 75. The DeSanctimonious is at 15, so we're leading by 60 points. But here's the thing you got to do, just go vote. Don't think about it. Pretend we're tied, pretend we're losing by three. You got to do this because you know the worst thing is everyone thinks, ""Oh, what do we have to vote for? Trump is killing them, and then bad things happen when that—"" pretend we're losing. Assume that we're down by three, four, or five, okay? You don't want to do what the Washington Post does and others where they make it so that it doesn't make sense. You know in Wisconsin for two elections, they put me down in Wisconsin at 17, I'm 17 down, right? I said, ""No way I'm 17 down. No way."" I asked John McLaughlin the great pollster, I said, ""Why would they do that? I'm winning in Wisconsin."" He said, ""They do that because that way people don't vote."" I said, ""What do you mean? Well, why don't they do it like at 5? Because they do get killed when they lose."" He said, ""They don't care about that. At 17, people won't vote. They'll say, we love Trump, but we're not going to vote for him. At 5, they say, he has a chance. We'll vote."" I said, ""Wow, that's really sick, huh?"" That's what it is. That's how bad they are that we won Wisconsin. They had us down 17 and we won Wisconsin, and then we did, frankly better the second time where we did better in most places the second time. But it was a rigged election. It was purely a rigged election. We went way up. People say, ""How'd you do the second time?"" I say, ""We did much better."" If you take a look, we got millions more votes a second time, and the new Rasmussen Poll of general election we're dominating Biden by 10 points. That's a lot because a friend of mine said, ""How come you're only winning by 10 or 14 points? There's another one 14 points."" I said, ""How could he be possibly that close?"" But they have a lot of people voting for them that aren't going to vote for us. But I'll tell you, a lot of the people that would normally vote for them, like the union people are voting for us other than the top people in the unions and even some of the top people in the unions are going for us, this could be an incredible situation. African Americans, we have the highest poll numbers we've ever had. Hispanic Americans, we have the highest poll numbers the Republican Party has ever had. We could actually win with Hispanics. I mean, it was unthinkable two or three years ago, we won the state of Florida. We did so well in Texas. We won the state of Texas and all of the border towns voted for Trump, and they're about 85, 90% Hispanic and won every single town along the border. First time in—they say the first time since reconstruction. You know what reconstruction means? That means the Civil War. I said, ""Give me a definition of reconstruction"" to the governor of Texas who endorsed me recently, by the way, as did almost everybody else. But I said, ""Give me a definition, governor of reconstruction, you said, I am the first one to win all of these towns since reconstruction,"" said, ""Well, reconstruction since the Civil War."" That's a long time ago. That's pretty good. So Hispanics, we're doing well, we're doing great with women. Finally, we're doing great. I think we've always done well with women. I think we've always done well with women, did very well. The reason we do well is they want security. Women want security. They want to have strong borders. They don't want to have crime. Little things like they don't want to have crime, and the Bloomberg Morning Consult Poll has us beating crooked Joe in every single swing state, by a lot, so but with all of that, they cheat like hell. So we have to get out. We got to watch them. They used COVID to cheat but they cheat almost uh automatically. The radical left democrats rigged the presidential election of 2020. We're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024. We're not going to allow it. You know the Washington Post had a poll two weeks ago. It came out. I was 10 up, then I was 11 up. They made a mistake and they actually put out a statement that this must be wrong, this poll, they paid like a million and a half dollars for a poll, and they're hoping it's wrong. Can you imagine that? It's the fake news. And then they went back and redid it and actually picked up a point. But those are the polls. I mean, we're up 10, 11, 12 points, which is considered to be a lot. You know they start off with a base. We don't, we have to earn ours, and we ran in 2016, we ran the whole East Coast. We won Florida, we won Georgia. We won South Carolina. North Carolina. We won. We won just about everything on the East Coast, and then we started. Then we went to the farm belt. We won everything. We were winning everything, and it was a big upset. I didn't think it was an upset. You know we'd go, we'd have crowds like this, and she'd have come out. Hillary Clinton, did anybody ever hear of beautiful Hillary? I don't use crooked anymore because—no, no, I don't use crooked anymore. You know why? Because I moved that name over to Joe. I thought it was more accurate, but we just won it all. And they said, ""You read that story, Time Magazine, cover of Time magazine."" They couldn't help themselves and uh we ","won it all. They said we were never going to let this happen again. And what they did was incredible and we're not going to let them do that again. You know they used COVID, they used COVID to cheat. We're not going to let—look what's happened to our country. We wouldn't have inflation. We wouldn't have had the Israel disaster. We wouldn't have Ukraine and Russia fighting. None of this. And they didn't. People said, ""How do we know they didn't fight?"" It was not going to happen. I spoke to Putin. I know him very well. I spoke to him. I spoke to President Xi. He would never have gone into Taiwan. That could be next, would never have gone into Taiwan, and we wouldn't have inflation because our energy prices were low. Energy caused inflation and energy has destroyed many families. It's uh, you know energy is considered very strongly. Energy is considered a country killer. If you look back over history, 200, 300 years, anytime there's inflation, countries die. And we have the highest inflation we've had in many, many, many decades. Every time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, communists, and fascists indict me, I considered a great badge of honor. It's a great badge of honor because I am being indicted for you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. [crowd cheering] CROWD: [chanting] We love Trump, We love Trump, We love Trump TRUMP: I don't know, I hear different stories. Did anybody ever hear of the great Alphonse Capone, Al Capone? Great head of the Mafia, right? Mean Scarface. He got a scar that went from here to here [points to his face] and he didn't mind at all, but he was a rough guy. Now I heard he was indicted once. A couple of people told me a few times more, but I was indicted four times, an Al Capone, Alphonse. If he had dinner with you and if he didn't like the way you smiled him at dinner, he would kill you. You'd be dead. By the time you walked out of the nice restaurant, you would be dead. He got indicted once, I got indicted four times, over bullshit I got indicted, bullshit. I got indicted over election interference so they could try and damage me and something happened that nobody's ever seen before. My numbers went way up because the people get it, and I believe they'll check this for me, but I believe that they'll find that I'm probably the only person in history that got indicted and the numbers went up. I can't imagine. When you get indicted. I've seen it many times. If you're a politician, you get indicted. You announce uh, ""I will be resigning office. I will go home to my family and I will fight for my name."" That's it. That's the end. You never hear from the guy again. That's the end of him. But with me, I let it be known how fake this stuff is. It's so fake. These people are sick. These people are sick and they're willing to fight dirty and they're willing to do dirty elections and everything else necessary. Never forget, our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. That's what I do. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. And in the end, they are not after me. They're after you. And I just happen to be standing in their way. I am in their way. I always will be. This is far more than a campaign. This is the greatest political movement in the history of our country by far. Nobody even challenges that. The fake news back there. Oh, there's a lot of news back—[crowd booing]. You see that big red light on the camera? All of a sudden, when I start talking about them, that light goes off, they turn it off. They go, ""Get it off! Get it off!"" No. We have some great journalists and reporters, but mostly, for the most part, they're corrupt and fake. Hence the term fake news. That was a good one. We have a lot of good ones. We are engaged in a righteous crusade to liberate this nation from a corrupt political class that is waging war on American democracy. And I'm telling you, Joe Biden is a threat to democracy. He's a threat to democracy. And you know one of the primary reasons he's a threat? Because he's incompetent and because he's allowing people in the White House to run this country, that's why. If you put me back in the White House, their reign will be over and America will be a free nation once again. So we have some great people with us today. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by state Senator Ira Hansen. Ira? Where is Ira? Thank you, Ira. Thank you for the endorsements and all of the other things. Nevada Assembly member, Alexis Hansen. Thank you, Alexis. Thank you very much. Nice to meet you back there. Ken Gray and John Ellison. Ken, John, thank you. Thank you very much. A tremendous man, a tremendous guy, gets treated so unfairly and he loves this country and he loves this state. Nevada GOP Chairman, Michael McDonnell, he's a fantastic man. Where is he? Thank you. Thank you, Michael. Incredible guy. Vice Chairman Jim Hindle. Jim? Thank you, Jim. This is a big place. A lot of people here. Clark County GOP Chairman, Jesse Law. Fantastic man. Fantastic man. Thank you, Jesse. Great job you're doing, a great job but treated very unfairly. Washoe GOP Chairman Bruce Parks. Thanks, Bruce. Great job. Good to meet you, Bruce. Great to meet you. Commissioners Jeanne Herman, Scott Keller, Wes Rice, Jay Carmona, and Tammy Hendrix. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, Jay. School board members Tom Hendrix and president of the Nevada Federation of Republican Women, Caroline Smith. Thank you. These are great people, great patriots. We have so many other political people we won't bother. Please forgive us. This is a big crowd. They don't want to hear this stuff, but these are great people. Together we will continue to fight for Nevada and fight for America like no one has ever fought before. In our first four years, we appointed nearly 300 federal judges and three great Supreme Court justices. I kept my promise, recognized Israel's eternal capitol, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. That was a big deal. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, something that nobody thought would happen, and maybe most importantly of all, but Biden did nothing with it, I withdrew from disaster. It was a disaster, the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. It was a disaster, but he didn't do anything with it. He would have done something. Iran was broke. They were broke. You could have made a great deal but he just sat around and now they got plenty of money as you'll hear and with the historic Abraham Accords, I even made peace in the Middle East. They would have been filled up. They would have all signed but nothing happened there either. We fully rebuilt the US military, created Space Force, which is very important, and I was the only president in decades who didn't start a war. Instead, I got us out of endless wars and I also defeated ISIS. We defeated ISIS. We defeated ISIS. It was supposed to take four years. I got it done in four weeks. We will once again have peace through strength when we become the 47th president of the United States, all of us, and I am the only candidate who can make this promise to you. I will prevent World War Three and we're very close to World War Three. We're very close. We have never been closer to World War Three. We have a man who's grossly incompetent and corrupt leading these, they're not even negotiating. There's nothing to negotiate. They're not negotiating. There's nothing happening, and we're in a very dangerous position. And the primary problem is the power of the weaponry, nuclear weapons and all. This is not Second World War. You hear me say it with army tanks going back and forth, shooting each other. This is not that. These are weapons of mass destruction. These are weapons so powerful, I don't even want to talk to you about it. They're so powerful. We didn't want to ever mention the words nuclear. We didn't want to talk about it. Now, every day you read about nuclear, nuclear, nuclear, and we have a man who's incompetent leading discussions. But the worst problem is there are no discussions. We will restore law and order to our communities, and I will direct a completely overhauled DOJ to investigate every radical out-of-control prosecutor in America for their illegal racist in reverse enforcement of the law. I am also going to indemnify all those policemen that were shaking my hand back there. You better be listening. Police officers, law enforcement, please listen. But we are going to indemnify police officers and law enforcement officials throughout the United States from being destroyed by the radical left for taking strong actions on crime. They're going to be indemnified. We're going to pay them for their costs, for their lawyers. You know policemen have to go, in many cases, hire a lawyer to protect themselves. The state doesn't want to get involved. These people are crazy what they're doing to our country. Policemen are forced not to do anything when they want to. And under the threat of losing their pension, their house, their family, they lose everything and they're afraid to move. They have to be. Anybody would be. They lose their house, their family, they lose everything. They lose their pension, and we're going to indemnify them, do the job. They can do the job and they want to do the job when they're standing there in front of a department store that's being looted by 400, mostly kids, but other people, too, and they want to do something so badly, but they're told not to because there's liability. They're not going to have any more liability. They're going to do their job. They're going to stop it. We're not going to let that happen anymore. In addition, we will take over our horribly run Washington, D.C. and clean up, renovate, and rebuild our Capitol so that it is no longer a nightmare of murder and crime. You see what's happening, but rather will become the most beautiful capitol anywhere in the world. It's a mess. It's a filthy, disgusting mess. Our parks will be cleaned, our tents and graffiti, all of these tents and graffiti right in the middle of the most beautiful parks in the world. Those tents and graffiti will be removed. Slum areas will be demolished and rebuilt to the highest level of architectural elegance. Washington, D.C. will become a symbol of beauty, security, freedom and strength, not what it is now. Not what it is now. In addition to our Capitol, we are going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety, and beauty better than they have ever been before. We are going to focus on our cities. You know in theory, a president doesn't get involved. You rely on a governor. You rely on the mayors. That's what we did with COVID. We relied on governors and mayors. Some governors were great, some governors weren't. Some mayors were good, some mayors weren't. But that's what you're supposed to do. When it comes to crime, we're going to get very much involved because I watched and I stood by and I watched Minneapolis. I watched Portland. I watched so many different places just burn, burn, violently burn. And I saved Minneapolis because we sent in the National Guard, even though I wasn't supposed to. It was supposed to be a governor thing, not a presidential thing, but we saved it. It was burning down. I remember CNN standing there and the anchor was saying, ""This is not a big problem. This is a very peaceful demonstration."" Do you remember? And behind him, the whole skyline of the city was on fire, right? Did you see that? And I saw that and I sent them in and we stopped it. You wouldn't even have that city right now. It will be the greatest investment ever made in these cities, and we will work closely with Democrat leaders. They are all run by Democrats, if you can believe it. But we'll work closely with the Democrat leaders of all these failing places to make sure that this rebuilding will be a lasting and compassionate one. It'll be a great rebuilding. Safety will again be restored so that our children can go out with their parents, mother and father, and play in the park without being beat up, molested, or shot. Students will be able to walk to school in peace. Criminal rates will plummet and people will just long to move back to the cities again. I've longed to move to Manhattan. When I was young, I grew up in Queens, I wanted to move to Manhattan. I wanted to show my father and my mother how smart I was. ""I'm going to move to Manhattan."" But I did. It was really a dream for me to move to Manhattan. Now people are moving out and they're moving out of our cities. All of our cities. Look at Chicago, look at Los Angeles, look at San Francisco, one of the greatest cities in the world. Fifteen years ago. Look at what's going on. We're going to make those cities great again. We came up with a plan. We were going to build new cities, and I thought that was good. I liked the idea. A very conservative plan, by the way. They put it forward. And I liked the idea. We talked about it for a while, but then I realized why would we want to build 10 new great cities when our cities are all in trouble because they've been so badly run. I said, ""I'd rather rebuild our existing cities and we can worry about the new cities at a later date."" Does that make sense? So we're going to rebuild our cities and we're going to make them safe. We're going to make them safe. We're going to rebuild our Capitol. We're going to take it. We're going to run it through the federal government, and it's going to be properly run. It's going to be safe. We're going to make it safe. We're going to get rid of the slums and we're going to build magnificent buildings and parks. We're also going to stand up to the radical left communists, Marxists, fascists, and frauds who have taken over our universities. They've taken over our schools. They have destroyed the reputations of once highly—these were really highly respected schools like Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Stanford, University of Pennsylvania, and others, indoctrinated our youth and brought censorship and anti-Semitism to our campuses. And did you hear those dumb people in Congress the other day? They couldn't answer the simplest question that anybody would be able to answer, whether it's one side or the other, you can answer that you cannot allow that to happen. That's all they had to say. Instead, they had a legal sentence. Whoever the lawyer was that briefed them should be fired immediately. They're all looking for jobs, I guess. Under the Trump administration, if colleges and universities discriminate against conservatives, Christians, Jews, anybody, if they attack free speech, we are going to take away their tax advantages, grants, and endowment. And they will pay a steep price and billions of dollars for the terror they have unleashed into our once great country. They're unleashing terror into our country. We're not going to stand for. And, by the way, our country is not great any longer. Our country is a very troubled nation. But we're going to make it great again. But our country is not great right now. It's so sad when I say, ""Our great country,"" but our country is not great right now. It's a total mess. Our country is a mess. Our country is no longer feared or respected. Four years ago, it was greatly respected and feared. I'll say it. They were feared, but it was greatly respected. Today, though, we're considered a joke, a laughingstock. I will rapidly end Crooked Joe Biden's inflation nightmare, end this war on American energy, and we will drill, baby, drill. We're going to drill. And unlike Ron DeSanctimonious, we will always protect Social Security and Medicare for our great seniors. He wanted to knock the hell out of Social Security and Medicare. We're also going to fight to give you much better health care. Obamacare is a catastrophe for American families, and it has been for years. Even Elizabeth Warren, did you ever hear of her? Often referred to as Pocahontas because of her great Indian heritage. Did you ever hear of Pocahontas? She said she was an Indian. She got into schools because she was an Indian. She got into schools. Think of it. She got jobs because she said she was an Indian until Trump came along and revealed the truth. But even Pocahontas says that it has to be fixed. She believes it has to be fixed. We're going to make it much less expensive for people with much better health care, and we're going to get that done. We almost got it done, but John McCain voted against it. That was a bad day. Remember that? Thumbs down after campaigning for 10 years, thumbs down everybody. Let's put your thumb down. Campaigned for 10 years on it. And then he put his thumb down. So somebody will explain that to me someday. On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children. And I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate. [cheers and applause]. And who can believe I would have to say this? I will keep men out of women's sports. Can you believe? And as I did for four years, and it wasn't easy, I will fully uphold the Second Amendment. I will protect innocent life and we will restore free speech in America once again. Very importantly to me, along with the border, just about as important it gets. We have to have strong borders, but we have to have secure elections and we will secure our elections, but we have to get going. Look, our goal will be one day voting with paper ballots and voter ID. Very simple. But until then, Republicans have to win. We have to win to put us in that position. We got to win. You know the way you win? You have to swamp them, because they're going to cheat like hell, but not like last time. I don't believe it was—they're going to cheat like hell. We have to swamp them. If you swamp them, they can only cheat so much. That's what happened in '16. But they weren't really prepared because they had no idea that we, we were that popular. They had no idea. If you took the 10 the worst presidents in the history of the United States and added them up, they would not have done near the destruction to our country as Joe Biden and the Biden administration has done. So if you want to save America from crooked Joe, then get every patriot and get them out to vote in their local caucus meeting on Thursday, February 8th. Go with Michael McDonald and all of the great people that are working so hard to turn your state around. You got to get out there. You got to vote. And again, remember please, they say we're going to win by a lot. Don't count on it. Just get out and vote. Otherwise, bad things happen. It's happened before. Bad things can happen. Remember, we're not talking about the meaningless government run universal mail-in ballot primary on Tuesday, February 6th. They have another, they have a primary, which doesn't matter because you have caucus and there will be no delegates awarded for the primary, so it really is, as I said it, the caucus is the only way to vote for President Trump. It's safe, it's secure, transparent, but it's also the only one that counts. It's February 8th ok? February 8th. Bring in as many people as you can. Sign up at nv.donaldjtrump.com. That's very important. Get out and vote even if you think we're going to have a massive landslide. Don't believe those polls as I said, assume you're one point, two points or three points down. Together we're taking on some of the most menacing forces and vicious opponents in our history. There's never been anything like it. And in conclusion, it doesn't matter how hateful and corrupt the communists and criminals are we're fighting. We're fighting against some really vicious people within our country. We have vicious people outside, but I believe truly that the people inside of our country are far worse because we can handle with the right president, in particular president, we can handle China or Russia. We can handle North Korea, Kim Jong Un. I saved us from a nuclear war. If Hillary Clinton got in, you would've ended up with millions of people being killed in a nuclear war. We can handle that if we have the right president, but what's very difficult are these corrupt communists that we have within our own country. They're very dangerous people, and you must never forget, this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you, it belongs to you. This is your home. This is your heritage, and our American liberty is your God-given right. From Las Vegas to Carson City, from Henderson to Minden and from Elko to right here in Reno, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our freedom. Nevada was founded by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk the face of the earth. This state was built by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys, laymen, builders, innovators and trailblazers who tamed the frontier, raised up the mighty Hoover Dam, transformed a sprawling desert into a shining oasis and lit up the brilliant lights of the Las Vegas strip. That's what it is. Our American ancestors risked everything to make this into the greatest nation in the history of the world. [crowd cheering] But now we are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that has the highest inflation in 50 years where banks are collapsing and interest rates are skyrocketing. Likewise, we are a nation where energy costs have reached the highest levels in our history. We are no longer energy independent or energy dominant as we were just a few short years ago. We are a nation that is begging Venezuela and others for oil. ""Please, please, please help us,"" Joe Biden says, and yet we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country anywhere in the world. We are a nation that just recently heard that Saudi Arabia and Russia will be reducing their oil production while at the same time substantially increasing the price. And we met that threat by announcing that we will we no longer be drilling for oil in large areas in Alaska or elsewhere, anywhere in our states. We are a nation that is consumed by the radical left's Green New Deal, yet everyone knows that the Green New Deal is fake. It is really the green new scam. We are a nation whose leaders are demanding all electric cars despite the fact that they can't go far, cost too much, and whose batteries are produced in China with materials only available in China when an unlimited amount of gasoline is available inexpensively in the United States but is not available in China. And now we are a nation that wants to make our revered and very powerful army tanks the best in the world, all electric, so that despite the fact they are also not able to go far, fewer pollutants will be released into the air as we blast our way through enemy territory, at least in an environmentally friendly way. And they also want to make our jet fighters with a green stamp of energy savings through losing 15% efficiency. That's all we'll lose, sir. That's all we'll lose. But allowing us to keep our enemy's atmosphere clean of emissions as we viciously and unceremoniously attack them at levels never seen before. Who are these people that would do this to us? Who are these people? It's so sad. It's so sad. It is so sad. We are a nation that ended oil exploration and production in the US just as the price of oil reached an all time high. What country would do such a foolish and self-destructive thing? Can we be energy independent or even energy dominant ever again? Yes, oh yes. And quickly says President Trump. Yes, oh yes and quickly. We can. We are a nation that surrendered in Afghanistan leaving dead soldiers, American citizens and $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment in the world behind. And also abandoning Bagram, one of the biggest military bases anywhere in the world and only one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. One hour away where weapons of mass destruction are being produced. And we left it, one of the biggest in the world. And we are a nation that allowed Russia and Ukraine to fight killing hundreds of thousands of people and it will only get worse. It would never have happened with me as your president. And for four straight years it didn't happen. Likewise, the horrifying attack on Israel would never have happened. They wouldn't even have thought of doing such a thing if President Trump was in the Oval Office. They would not have even thought about it. Iran was broke under President Trump. They didn't have the money to fund Hamas, Hezbollah and all of the other instruments of terror that they can now fund very easily. But those sanctions were lifted by a corrupt Biden administration and now Iran as a rich country with $200 billion and another 6 billion for hostages and $10 billion for electricity to Iraq all compliments of the incompetent Biden administration. And China with Taiwan is next. We are a nation that allows radical left terrorists to violently attack our cities, leaving behind massive destruction and death. And nothing happens to the criminals that do these terrible things. There is no punishment. But when people who love our country protest in Washington, they become hostages and prisoners unfairly imprisoned for long periods of time. We are a third world nation that has weaponized its law enforcement against the opposing political party like never, ever before. We've got the Federal Bureau of Investigation that won't allow bad election changing facts to be presented to the public and which offers $1 million to a writer of fiction about Donald Trump to lie and say it was actually fact. Where Hunter Biden's laptop from hell was rushing this disinformation and the FBI knew it wasn't, but 51 intelligence agents said it was. And a Department of Justice that refuses to investigate egregious acts of voting irregularities and fraud. And we have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst President of the history of our country who is cognitively impaired and in no condition to lead and is now in charge of dealing with Russia at possible nuclear war, which would be World War III and far more devastating than any of the previous world wars because of the weaponry involved, because of the power of the horrible, horrible weaponry. We are a nation that no longer has a free and fair press. Fake news is all you get and they are indeed the enemy of the people. They refuse to discuss the Biden crime family, but enjoy covering the false indictments of Donald J. Trump who has done nothing wrong except win an election. We are a nation where free speech is no longer allowed and where crime is rampant and out of control like never before. We are a nation that is allowing Iran to build a massive nuclear weapon and China to use the trillions of dollars it has taken from us to build a military to rival our own. And less than three years ago, we had Iran, China, Russia and North Korea in check. They respected us. They were afraid of us. They were never going to do a thing to us and everyone knows it. Now Russia and China are holding summits to carve up the rest of the world. And perhaps most importantly, we are a nation that is no longer admired, respected, or listened to on the world stage. We are a nation that in many ways has become a joke and we are a nation that is hostile to liberty, freedom, faith, and even to God. We are a nation whose economy is collapsing into a cesspool of ruin, whose supply chain is broken, whose stores are not stocked, whose deliveries are not coming, and whose educational system is ranked at the bottom of every single list. We are a nation where large packs of sadistic criminals and thieves are allowed to go into stores and openly rob them, beat up and kill their workers and customers and leave with armloads of goods but with no retribution. Where the authority of our great police has been taken, where their families and pensions have been threatened and their lives would be destroyed for the mere mention of the words law and order. We are a nation where fentanyl and all other forms of illegal drugs are easier to get than groceries to feed our beautiful families. We have become a drug infested, crime-ridden nation, which is incapable of solving the simplest of problems. We will institute the powerful death penalty for drug dealers where each dealer is responsible for the death, during their lives, of 500 people or more. This is the the only thing that will work. Let me know when you're ready. Mothers will never again be forced to watch their children overdosing and hopelessly dying in their arms screaming, ""What can I do? What can I do?"" We are a nation whose once revered airports are a dirty crowded mess. You sit and wait for hours and then are notified that the plane won't leave and they have no idea when they will, where the ticket prices have tripled. They don't have the pilots to fly the planes. They don't seek qualified air traffic controllers and they just don't know what the hell they're doing. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, willpower, and strength. We are a nation that has lost its way, but we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Three years ago we were a great nation and we will soon be a great nation again. It was hard-working patriots like you who built this country and it is hard-working patriots like you who are going to save our country. We will fight for America like no one has ever fought before. With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state, we will drive out the globalists, we will cast out the communists, we will throw off the sick political glass. We will rout the fake news media. We will drain the swamp and we will liberate our country from these tyrants and villains once and for all. We will be ","liberated. Like those patriots before us, we will not bend, we will not break, we will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up and we will never, ever back down. With your support, we will go on to victory, the likes of which no one has ever seen before. We will evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House and we will take back our country on election day 2024. The great silent majority is rising like never before. And under our leadership, the forgotten men and women will be forgotten no longer. We will love our country. We will take care of our country. We will pray to God for our strength and for our liberty. We will pray for God and we will pray with God. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you Reno. Thank you Reno. Thank you Nevada. God bless you all. God bless you.",""

Chris Sununu joined Jonathan Karl on ABC's This Week and Adam Sexton on WMUR's Close Up. ABC's This Week   HALEY ON GOV. SUNUNU'S ENDORSEMENT... ""It's huge. First to have the endorsement of the largest conservative, freedom-loving grassroots organization in the country with Americans for Prosperity, and then go get the endorsement of the 'Live Free or Die' governor. I mean, it doesn't get any better than that. I mean, it's rock-solid. And you know we're focused on, how do we make it a 'Live Free or Die' country? How do we put the people back in charge? And Chris is such a great partner, we've had a great time. We've won so many rooms and you know we're just getting started.""   HALEY ON HER DIFFERENCES WITH TRUMP... ""There are things I agree with the president on. I had a good working relationship with him. There are things I don't agree with. I don't agree with the fact that, yes, we had a good economy while he was there, but he put us $8 trillion in debt that our kids are never going to forgive us for. I don't agree with how he handles national security. He focused on trade with China, but he did nothing about the fentanyl flow. He did nothing about the fact that fentanyl has killed so many of our Americans. I don't think you should praise Hezbollah. I don't think you should criticize Netanyahu, when Israel's down on her knees. I don't think you should congratulate the Chinese Communist Party on their 70th anniversary. I think that when it comes to national security, we don't praise thugs. We let them know where we stand and we let them know there'll be hell to pay if they do anything against us. That's who I am."" HALEY ON THE MEDIA'S OBSESSION WITH TRUMP... ""You guys are exhausting. You're exhausting in your obsession with him. The thing is, the normal people aren't obsessed with Trump like you guys are. The normal people care about the fact that they can't afford things. They feel like their freedoms are being taken away. They think government's too big. I know y'all want to talk about every single word he says, and every single Tweet he does. That's exactly why we need a new generational leader. Because people don't want to hear about every word a person says or every Tweet. They want to know how you fought for them that day."" WMUR's Close Up   SUNUNU ON THE ""TWO-PERSON"" RACE... ""It is a two-person race between Nikki Haley and Donald Trump. And even Trump voters I think are realizing, you know, we might have supported him 16 and 20 as we did, but we're results-driven. We want accountability with our elected officials. So inflation is crushing families across this country. Here in New Hampshire, right, the border needs to be secured and you need a president that's going to give a 120% of their time without the distractions, without the chaos... Leadership gets it done every time. Real leadership can get that done. That's what Nikki brings to the table."" HALEY ON THE BOSTON MAYOR'S SEGREGATED HOLIDAY PARTY... ""Not healthy at all, not anything that we should have... The problem we have in the country right now is people are constantly trying to label and divide everyone. We're Americans. Can't we get back to that? Can't we start acting like that? We're mothers, sisters, daughters, all of these things that make us united, that's what we should focus on. You don't split people up based on how they look or what religion they are or what gender they are. I mean, that's not America and that's what we have to stop. This national self-loathing that's happened in the country has happened because too many people are dividing us on labels. It's a terrible example for our kids and it's got to stop. We'll put an end to all of that. And she should be called out. There's no good in having any kind of party that separates people on race. That is not the America we live in, and she shouldn't be leading like that.""","","",""

Ron DeSantis claimed during a Dec. 12 town hall that former U.S. ambassador Nikki Haley wants to raise the retirement age and that life expectancy is on the decline. Verdict: Misleading Haley has called for the retirement age to be raised for young people, such as individuals in their 20s, not for a uniform raising across all demographics. Life expectancy has begun to rebound after being on a downward trajectory due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fact Check: DeSantis appeared at a CNN town hall Dec. 12, where he criticized Trump on abortion, the border wall and COVID-19, according to The Associated Press. During the town hall, he also went after Haley for her positions on Social Security, USA Today reported. DeSantis said that Haley claimed ""the retirement age is way, way, way too low"" and that ""[l]ife expectancy is declining in this country."" ""So, what she has said, Nikki Haley, she has claimed that the retirement age is way, way, way too low. That's what she said. So, you got a lot of people that have worked hard their whole life. Life expectancy is declining in this country. It's tragic. But it's true,"" DeSantis said. ""So, to look at those demographic trends, and say that, you would jack it up, so that people are not going to be able to have benefits? I mean, I don't know why she's saying that. You got to look at the trends."" DeSantis' claims about Haley's position on Social Security and life expectancy are missing context and misleading. Haley has repeatedly stated she would not touch entitlement benefits for people currently on Social Security. ""It's the new ones coming in. It's those in their 20s that are coming in. You're coming to them and you're saying, the game has changed. We're going to do this completely differently,"" Haley said in March 2023, according to CNN. Haley said in September 2023, ""I'll raise the retirement age – only for younger people who are just entering the system"" during a speech at St. Anselm College, according to MarketWatch. ""Americans are living 15 years longer than they were in the 1930s. If we don't get out of the 20th century mindset, Social Security and Medicare won't survive the first half of the 21st century,"" Haley said. NewsNation reported Dec. 7 that Haley ""[b]elieves older Americans should not see cuts to their benefits and promised to keep programs intact for people who are in their 40s or older."" ""Wants to raise the retirement age for young adults 'coming into the system' in their 20s 'so that it matches life expectancy,'"" NewsNation reported. Haley also said during the Nov. 8 Republican primary debate that she wanted to raise the retirement age for people in their 20s, according to NBC News. DeSantis' claim on declining life expectancy needs context. Credible news reports have indicated that there was a drop-in life expectancy from 2019 to 2021. However, 2022 saw a rebound from the previous years, according to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC report found that in 2022, life expectancy increased by 1.1 years. This still has not overcome the 2.4 year deficit that was seen between 2019 and 2021. The reason for this decrease appears to have been mainly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, USA Today reported. Elizabeth Arias, a researcher with the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, told CNN that COVID-19 deaths in 2022 were ""not insubstantial."" For life expectancy to increase, there would need to be ""another large decline"" in COVID-19 mortality, she explained. Today, the CDC reports that the average lifespan for men is 73.5 while it is 79.3 for women. Haley's campaign put out a press release arguing that DeSantis' claim about life expectancy was false, saying that ""life expectancy dropped during COVID but rebounded last year."" Nachama Soloveichick, communications director for the Haley campaign, told Check Your Fact that DeSantis ""is the world's biggest hypocrite and phony."" ""Ron DeSantis is the world's biggest hypocrite and phony. In 2012, he called for raising the retirement age because people are living longer and Social Security is running out of money. In 2013, 2014, and 2015 he voted to raise the retirement age in Congress. Now he's criticizing Nikki Haley because he's desperate to save his failing campaign. Voters can smell a phony 100 miles away,"" Soloveichick said.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/369241",5136,"The keene Sentinel by Christopher Cartwright Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley focused on her track record and touted plans for border security, at a town hall event in Keene Wednesday evening. A few hundred people showed up in attendance at Tempesta's Ballroom at the Best Western Hotel, where Haley discussed topics ranging from border policy to foreign relations. ""I'll tell you this. If you will join with me, if you will join with Chris [Sununu], if you will join with this movement, I promise you that our best days are yet to come,"" she said. Haley is a former governor of South Carolina and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. As she walked on stage to the song ""Eye of the Tiger"" by the rock band Survivor Wednesday evening, she remarked positively on Sununu's governance style. ""We both see things in a very similar way. The fact that government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people,"" she said. ""… And the idea that I keep thinking [is], 'How cool would it be if we had a 'live free or die' country?' "" Sununu, who endorsed Haley Tuesday, appeared onstage earlier, after being introduced by Keene Mayor George Hansel. Sununu opened his speech by saying Haley's campaign had gained momentum and added that he was ""120 percent"" behind her. ""The energy is there. Folks are coming out,"" he said. ""… The momentum is there. The opportunity is there."" Haley focused the first third of her speech on her former career as governor and U.N. ambassador, highlighting the bills she signed into law as governor, including a voter ID law, small business tax cuts, and ""one of the toughest illegal immigration laws in the country."" That bill, passed in 2011, required that police check the immigration status of anyone they stopped or arrested and suspected might be in the country without proper documentation, according to previous reporting by Reuters. Several sections of the law were blocked in a federal court in 2011, after the ACLU argued in court that they were unconstitutional and interfered with federal laws, according to the organization's website. ""And then I got the call for the United Nations, and my honest answer was, I don't even know what the U.N. does; I just know everybody hates it,"" she said to some laughter. ""And I wasn't wrong about that."" She said that at the U.N., her goal was for other countries to ""respect America."" ""We pulled ourselves out of the Iran deal; we moved the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem; I pushed China to pass the largest set of sanctions against a country in a generation,"" she said, referencing sanctions against North Korea. ""… But the best thing that we did was we took the 'kick me' sign off of our backs, and America was respected again."" Haley then transitioned into discussing current problems residents face, including the high cost of living, and placed blame on President Joe Biden and certain elected Republicans. ""You go look at that 2.2 trillion-dollar COVID stimulus bill that they passed with no accountability,"" she said. ""… And did Republicans try to make it right? No, they doubled down … in the 2024 appropriations budget, Republicans put in 7.4 billion dollars' worth of pet projects and earmarks. Democrats put in 2.8 billion."" She also highlighted high rates of homelessness, suicide among veterans, conflicts abroad and education issues. To solve some of the problems, Haley advocated for imposing term limits, administering a mental competency test for lawmakers over the age of 75, going after pandemic relief fraud and taking a hardline stance on the federal budget. ""They have one job. It's to give us a budget on time. Don't ever let them talk to you about shutting down [the] government,"" she said. ""… I think it's time we tell them, 'You don't give us a budget on time, you don't get paid.'"" For border security, Haley's idea to defund sanctuary cities and put 25,000 Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on the ground was met with cheers and applause. Areas where officials limit cooperation with federal immigration officials are sometimes called sanctuary cities. In 2017, Peterborough residents rejected a sanctuary city proposal by ballot, while Harrisville voters approved one by ballot that same year, according to previous reporting by The Sentinel. At the end, Haley accepted several questions from audience members, including one about her plans for Social Security. ""We have to deal with reform of Social Security and Medicare, but that doesn't mean you should fear it,"" she said. ""… If you paid in, if you've been promised, you should get exactly what you've been promised. But those that we change it on are [people] like my kids in their 20s … we go to them, and we say we're going to change the retirement age to reflect life expectancy."" John Martin of Chesterfield told a reporter separately that although he is an independent, he was ""very impressed"" by some of Haley's ideas. ""I think we align on more things than we disagree with,"" he said. ""… I'm looking for an alternative to, you know, the front-runners.""","","",""

It's really about the personal connections I was watching her make across the state, town to town, not just in Manchester or in Portsmouth or whatever it was, but spending time in the Monadnock region, spending time up North or in Coos or in Grafton.

""We don't go backwards in our process. And I think more and more folks are going to come to that conclusion. The veterans are getting on board. The conservatives are getting on board. Undeclared voters that have never voted before are getting excited about a candidacy with Nikki Haley as the president. They're getting on board. So we're going to have record turnout. There's no doubt about it. She's the only candidate putting a solid ground game together here in New Hampshire. She doesn't fly in and do a speech on a stage, wave a little bit, make some crude remarks and fly away. That's not campaigning. That's not engaging with voters. She's doing it the right way. In these last weeks, that's where that momentum really compounds, and will deliver her a huge win."" HALEY ON CRUSHING JOE BIDEN BY 17 POINTS... ""If you look at those general election polls...

Ambassador Nikki Haley's presidential campaign will launch a new digital advertisement Thursday, first shared with the Daily Caller News Foundation, hitting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over his previous and current statements on social security reform. The ad, titled ""DeSantis Then Vs. Now,"" takes aim at comments DeSantis made when he was a congressional candidate when he argued that social security needed reform for younger generations. A second clip is then played from a CNN town hall on Tuesday during which the Florida governor criticized Haley for wanting to increase the retirement age. ""Ron DeSantis is the world's biggest hypocrite and phony,"" Nachama Soloveichick, communications director for the Haley campaign, told the DCNF in a statement. ""In 2012, he called for raising the retirement age because people are living longer and Social Security is running out of money.

Voters can smell a phony 100 miles away."" In a 2012 interview with the St. Augustine Record, DeSantis pledged not to change social security for those who are already on the program or who are close to the retirement age. However, the then-congressional candidate did say reform was necessary for younger Americans to adapt with higher life expectancies. ""But what I think we need to do for people in my generation, particularly, is start to restructure the program in a way that's going to be financially sustainable,"" said DeSantis. ""Me getting social security at 65 or 67 if I'm going to live into my 80s is probably not sustainable. When social security was created, the age that you received the benefit was actually higher than the life expectancy was ... the system was not originally designed for people to be on it for 30 years, so we just have to understand that, that it's a mathematical problem, and to allow people like me who have a lot longer to go to make some changes for us."" During the town hall with CNN's Jake Tapper, DeSantis maintained that social security benefits should be protected. The governor then criticized Haley for wanting to increase the retirement age, and argued that life expectancy is dropping. ""So, what she has said, Nikki Haley, she has claimed that the retirement age is way, way, way too low,"" said DeSantis. ""So, you got a lot of people that have worked hard their whole life. Life expectancy is declining in this country. It's tragic. But it's true. So, to look at those demographic trends, and say that, you would jack it up, so that people are not going to be able to have benefits? I mean, I don't know why she's saying that. You got to look at the trends."" After record dips from the COVID-19 pandemic, life expectancy began to increase in 2022, CNN reported on Nov. 29, citing data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). However, the life expectancy estimates are still far from pre-pandemic levels. ... Haley hasn't called for rolling back benefits for those already enrolled in the program, and is instead proposing to raise the retirement age for young adults currently in their 20s, according to CNN. The former ambassador would restrict benefits for wealthier Americans. Former President Donald Trump also took shots at DeSantis, before the governor officially launched his White House bid, over his voting record and stances on social security. The Haley campaign is also criticizing DeSantis over voting for budget resolutions that would've increased the retirement age to 70 during his time in Congress, CNN reported in February. The ad comes on the heels of a Haley endorsement from New Hampshire's Republican Gov. Chris Sununu. Haley has surged to second place in the first-in-the-nation primary state, and has been gaining ground in Iowa as well.","","",""

But you don't start drawing conditions on what they can and can't do. This was a country that fell to her knees with the worst attack since the Holocaust.

Let them finish the job. Let them finish Hamas once and for all. Stop telling them what they can and can't do."" On what America can do to stop Iran... ""Iran decided years ago and they've been very good at it, at using their proxies rather than doing things themselves. There would be no Houthis without Iran. There would not be Hamas without Iran. There would not be Hezbollah without Iran. So they're using their proxies to do their dirty work. But if we really want to do something, why doesn't Joe Biden go back and put the sanctions down on Iran that were already there?

And why not go after those in Syria and Iraq that continue to hit our military men and women? Hit their infrastructure in Syria and Iraq, give them one big punch and they will step back. But right now, they don't fear us."" On defunding the UN... ""It's the reason that we got out of the Paris Climate Agreement when I was at the UN. It's the reason we got out of the Human Rights Council. It's the reason we stopped any taxpayer dollars going to the Palestinian Refugee Organization. We absolutely should get out of the World Health Organization and anything that the UN is doing, look at how they failed at looking at the human rights abuses of what happened to the women on October 7.

""I am thrilled to help lead Ron DeSantis' National Finance Committee as we continue to work tirelessly to elect him the next President,"" said Co-Chairman Nick Iarossi. ""Ron DeSantis is a proven leader and the only candidate in this race capable of winning big for Republicans, serving two terms, and implementing the conservative policies we need to reverse our nation's decline. The fundraising apparatus the campaign has built in the last few months has been historic, and we are excited to take it to the next level in the weeks and months ahead."" ""In the past century of this nation's history, it is difficult to find a more impactful governor than my friend of twenty-five years, Ron DeSantis,"" said Co-Chairman Michael McClellan. ""In a time when our nation faces grave challenges at home and abroad, we cannot afford the poor leadership and chaos of those who are not up to the job. Ron DeSantis uniquely possesses the talent, courage, and tenacity to revive our failing politics and lead our nation to a future we can be proud to hand our children.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Ron DeSantis today joined the Doug Wagner Show live. The highlights are below. Listen to the full interview here. On his unmatched ground game in Iowa:  What everyone's saying, from Governor Reynolds to people that have been involved – we have the best ground game that anyone's ever been able to do, the most caucus commitments this far in advance of a caucus in modern history. We've got everybody, every county has got a chairman, we've got precinct captains in almost every precinct, over 1000, over 120 faith leader endorsements, oh and of course, we've visited personally 99 counties -- and actually done events in 99 counties. We didn't just stop to get gas in some of the counties. We went, we met, we talked with folks and answered their questions. And, you know, that's, I think what Iowans expect. I mean, they want you to come, they want to hear what you have to say, they want to ask your questions, and they want you to earn it. And so we're doing that, and we're going to continue to do that all the way through January 15.  On Joe Biden's impeachment inquiry:  I think a lot of this has been overdue. I mean, we've seen evidence of the financial corruption with his family, the exorbitant amount of money that has been going into the coffers of their family. Biden has made conflicting and false statements about his role in this. So they absolutely, an inquiry is warranted. And you know, I hope that they're able to be able to get all the information and all the facts.  On how he will reverse Bidenomics:  When people are going to the grocery store, you're talking about, over the last two or three years, you're talking about 50%, 75%, even doubling the cost of groceries. You also look at, if you want to buy a home now, with interest rates being where they are, the average priced home today, the monthly payment on a mortgage would be twice what it was four or five years ago. And that's really difficult for a lot of families who are trying to get ahead. So I think those are still huge things. Now there has been some let up on the gas prices, which I think people appreciate. But I don't think that was anything because of Biden's policies. I mean, I think that has to do more with other things going on in the economy. I think we need to open up all the energy for production. We need to produce as much as we can here, lower prices, lower energy costs across the economy, and actually be able to export energy to nations so that they don't have to worry about Russia and Iran and Venezuela. We should never have to go hand in hand to any of those countries, but we don't want our allies to be dependent on them either.","","",""

Last week we were endorsed by the most conservative, freedom-loving, grassroots organization in the country with Americans for Prosperity. Then yesterday to be endorsed by the 'Live Free or Die' governor. You know, the momentum is on our side.

I think it's time that we do that."" SUNUNU ON HALEY BEING ""THE WHOLE PACKAGE""...  ""If everybody that can vote comes out and votes there's no doubt Nikki Haley is going to win this thing in a landslide here in New Hampshire. That's the fundamental change. It's not a candidate in a campaign, it's a movement... You've got to earn every vote but there's no doubt the momentum is there... This isn't just let's get behind a candidate that can win. That's obvious. This is really getting behind the best qualified person to be president of the United States and that's what gets it so exciting. It is a full package deal for the citizens of New Hampshire and ultimately kicking off for the rest of the country."" New Hampshire Today with Chris Ryan   SUNUNU ON NIKKI HALEY'S WORK ETHIC... ""...In the past three or four weeks, the feedback I was getting from other folks saying she's the real deal. Like I've known her for a long time, we've been friends and of course, but people started seeing what I have known for a long time. She's the real deal. She's not just talking at 30,000 feet. She's talking about real issues and more importantly, listening about how to bring real solutions and the appreciation of our process here...""  SUNUNU ON WHAT HIS SUPPORT LOOKS LIKE...  ""Unrelenting."" The WFEA Morning Update with Drew Cline   SUNUNU ON HIS HALEY ENDORSEMENT... ""Look, it's about connection. That's what we want in New Hampshire. I've actually probably spent more time with all three of the significant, all the governors, all the significant heads, probably more than anybody else in the country. I've gone to all their events many times and they all have good campaigns. But Nikki has a connection. And it isn't just what I see, it's the feedback I get. Everybody's like, oh my gosh, she's the real deal... That's what 'Live Free or Die' is all about, right? ...They understand limited government local control, none of this big government Republican stuff that we've had years of... So it's not just what she says— everyone can have a good game on the campaign, but hers is fantastic. It's really I think how she's been interacting with the citizens. The momentum's there, the numbers are moving... So I just think it's an absolute home run.""","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/369235",4370,"New Hampshire Union Leader by Chris Sununu I am enthusiastically endorsing Nikki Haley for president of the United States, and I am asking New Hampshire voters to join me in being a part of this movement. We must support the best conservative candidate in this race who can win in November 2024 to deliver results in 2025. New Hampshire has never looked to candidates of the past who had their chance but failed to deliver on their promises. We never settle — we look to the future and the candidate that can offer a fresh vision with real opportunity to deliver on their promises. In six short weeks, Granite Staters will head to the polls in record numbers and uphold our 100-year responsibility of hosting the First in the Nation Primary. We have an obligation to get it right — and Nikki Haley is the best person for the job. The polling is clear — Nikki is the best Republican candidate to beat the Democrats this November. Just this week, a new poll from the Wall Street Journal showed that in a head-to-head matchup with President Joe Biden, Nikki Haley beats him by 17 points — an astronomical number that should give confidence and momentum to Republican candidates up and down the ballot. With Nikki Haley at the top of the ticket, Republicans will win the presidency, the United States Senate and House, retain the New Hampshire governor's office, and expand majorities in our state legislature. With Trump at the top of the ticket, Republicans have consistently lost races we should have won — just look at 2018, 2020, and the 2022 red wave that never materialized. While Donald Trump is running to save himself, Nikki Haley is running to save America. First elected to statewide office as part of the 2010 Tea Party wave, Nikki Haley energized South Carolinians in her race for governor and never looked back. As governor, she balanced budgets and prioritized limited government and local control. As the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, she took on China and Russia, and understands that world peace comes from American strength. She stands with our allies in Israel and Ukraine. She will crack down on illegal immigration and stop the flow of deadly fentanyl pouring over our southern border. In these uncertain times, she offers a steady hand to right the ship here at home and abroad. Nikki Haley is surging in New Hampshire because she's running a true ""Live Free or Die"" campaign. She's pounding the pavement, meeting voters in their living rooms, holding town halls, and going diner-to-diner. She's not just talking wherever she goes, she's listening — and that's what it takes to be a great leader. She's looked us in the eye, answered our questions, and taken the time to build trust. Polls indicate Donald Trump will likely win the Iowa Caucus. Once that happens, the nation will turn its eyes towards New Hampshire. We pride ourselves on our independent streak, and there is no better way to show it than by catapulting Nikki Haley to a strong showing here, providing her with the opportunity to take on Donald Trump one-on-one in the months ahead. Unlike many states, New Hampshire allows undeclared voters — independents, who account for about a third of our electorate — to vote in our primary. With a stagnant race on the Democrat side as Joe Biden skips over New Hampshire, it's fair to assume many independents will select Republican ballots next year. My message to the independents of New Hampshire is simple: To move on from the drama, chaos, and whining of Donald Trump, the best choice is Nikki Haley. I have always said, you cannot govern if you cannot win. I consider Governors Ron DeSantis and Chris Christie friends, and I believe they would both make strong presidents. But in 2024, Republicans must unite around the candidate that has the best chance at defeating Donald Trump in the primary so that we can get back to winning up and down the ballot. A divided field with multiple candidates only helps to insulate Donald Trump from facing his record and his failures. We must consolidate behind one candidate — the candidate who has the best chance of victory — because without a clearly defined opponent, he will hide until the primary process is over. We have an opportunity to pull Trump out of his shadow by nominating Nikki Haley. I hope you will join me on Tuesday, January 23rd, in voting Nikki Haley for president.","","",""

On Joe Biden's impeachment inquiry: This is part of the reason why I thought it was important that we do this Newsom debate -- obviously, there's a lot of Democrats that want to remove him. They understand the liabilities. They understand his bad policies. I think he is not willing to step down at this point. But who knows what's going to happen? And I think this inquiry is justified. I think it should have been done long ago. He's got so many issues that are clouding his presidency. He clearly would not be a great candidate for the Democrats. So Republicans, we need to be ready for whoever they pull out of the hat. Newsom has been waiting in the wings. On his debate with Gavin Newsom and the importance of future debates: The reaction that I've gotten has been incredible in terms of obviously being able to show that freedom works and the California model's a failure and what that means for the country, but people appreciated the way you set it up. And they said it was the most substantive debate that they've seen in this entire election cycle. And so kudos to you for doing it. I know he had challenged me, and you asked me to do it. So I'm glad we were able to get that done. And just know, if you want to do other debates, Nikki Haley and me, I'm in. Donald Trump and me, I'm in. So just say the word. You've shown that you can do it in a way that I think really helps the voter. So I'm game, just let me know. On what is at stake for voters in 2024: We have a government that's actively working against hardworking Americans. They're working hard. They can't get ahead because of inflation, interest rates, Bidenomics, the bureaucracy. We have an open border, where 8 million people have come since Biden has been president, from all over the world, including the Middle East. We know that there are potential terrorists that have come in. That's made the American people less safe, less secure. We have fentanyl pouring into our communities. We have cities that are collapsing, San Francisco, Los Angeles, but also Philly, Chicago, all these places where obviously cities have always had issue, but they're becoming unlivable. So you have all these issues that are compounding... I think we can reverse this decline, Sean, but 2024 is make or break.","","",""

Tallahassee, FL - During a virtual press conference with Iowa media today, Ron DeSantis hammered Nikki Haley for refusing to commit to the next Republican Presidential Primary debate in Iowa on January 10. ""I've committed to [the debate]. I don't know that either Donald Trump or Nikki Haley have been willing to commit to do a debate. I think if you're not willing to debate in Iowa on the eve of the caucus, that shows the voters a lot about you, and about your willingness to engage on these issues. So I want to debate. I'll be there,"" DeSantis said. ""I think people in Iowa are catching on to this, Haley really represents the failed political establishment of yesteryear... Certainly, in a one-on-one debate, we would be able to really see that contrast very sharply. And I think it would be a contrast that would benefit me vis-a-vis Nikki Haley in terms of these Iowa caucus voters."" Additional highlights from the event are below. Watch the full virtual press conference here. On why there should be a debate in Iowa: We're hoping that there's going to be a debate in Iowa in January. I've committed to it. I don't know that either Donald Trump or Nikki Haley have been willing to commit to do a debate. I think if you're not willing to debate in Iowa on the eve of the caucus, that shows the voters a lot about you, and about your willingness to engage on these issues. So I want to debate. I'll be there. We did the town hall last night on CNN. We're hoping to be able to do some with some other media outlets as well. Ultimately, you got to show up, and you got to answer people's questions. And that's what we've been doing, and that's what we're going to continue to do all the way up until caucus night. But the notion that you just don't show up and you don't answer questions, you're not willing to debate, that's going to be meaningful to a lot of voters because ultimately it's about them, and it's about them being able to make the best decision about who they want to see as the candidate going forward for the Republican Party. On why Nikki Haley is afraid to debate and defend her liberal agenda: I think people in Iowa are catching on to this- Haley really represents the failed political establishment of yesteryear. I think if you look at the positions she's taken talking about doxing people on social media, she said on her first day in office, 'I want your names,' for people that are using social media. But we know, as conservatives, that's been used for cancel culture, it's been used to malign conservatives. People have lost jobs and stuff because of those types of attacks. And so that's a total abuse of government. We would never indulge in anything like that. She also said that having a limit on immigration was wrong, that you talk to CEOs and let them import who they want. But we know that some of these CEOs, they would import cheap labor to undercut American workers, and that would not be good for American wages. And so that's more of a corporatist position that she's taken. She even refused to join support Florida's legislation -- I know Iowa's worked on this -- to not have these gender surgeries on the minors. I signed the bill. She said the law shouldn't have anything to do with it. So I think on issue after issue -- and then you look at some of the people that are supporting her, liberal executives on Wall Street, rallying people from these big banks who were very liberal Democrats, people that have supported Hillary Clinton in the past, big people out in California who've been very, very liberal, very hostile to Donald Trump when he was president, for example, that really is par for the course for a candidate who has said the reason she got into politics was because of Hillary Clinton and not Ronald Reagan, not Margaret Thatcher, but Hillary Clinton. So I think that that says a lot. I think people are starting to see that. But certainly, a one-on-one debate, we would be able to really see that contrast very sharply. And I think it would be a contrast that would benefit me vis-a-vis Nikki Haley in terms of these Iowa caucus voters. On his leadership philosophy: I'm not a ruler. I'm a servant. I'm also understanding about my role as a parent of a first grader, kindergartener, and a preschooler. My wife and I both believe that we have the responsibility to be good role models for our kids. And that's what drives us. But I think that that's exemplified in how you conduct yourself in office, how you conduct yourself as a candidate, how you conduct yourself as president of the United States. I want people to know that supporting me as president, that when I get up there, obviously, I'm going to take care of business, but I'm going to be able to conduct myself in a way they're going to be able to be proud of. They're not going to have to make excuses for me. I'll go, I'll lead, we'll execute, get the job done, and we'll do it in a way that I think really aims higher. On moving the US Department of Agriculture to Iowa: Iowa will have first dibs on the Department of Agriculture. We'll work with the people in Iowa to see what they would want and how they would want to do it. But what I'd like to see is, if you have an agency like USDA, I'd like to see it staffed by people who have a familiarity with what's going on in places like Iowa, that understand what they're doing in terms of agriculture and farming. And they're not just pointy headed bureaucrats that are imposing an agenda without having any concept of how that's actually impacting people's daily lives and their professions. And so I think it's going to be more than just agriculture. We want to really look to get power outside of Washington. And if Iowa doesn't want it, we'll offer it to others, but I think a lot of people think it'd be a good idea. On his momentum in Iowa and the upcoming caucus: We have tens of thousands of caucus commitments. We're adding more, a bunch every day. More and more people are starting to make decisions. This is something that breaks late. In that poll, you know, to the extent that people are going to take that, 46% haven't made up their mind entirely. And so there's a lot of nominal Trump supporters who have not fully decided to go with him and are open to another candidate. And that's what we're seeing on the ground. And yes, so it's already helped us because of the amount of people that we already have committed to caucus for us. And we're going to continue to add that, so we're going to go into this caucus with a huge base of support, and there's a lot of enthusiasm about what people are seeing on the ground, so we're excited about it.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370101",3087,"CHARLESTON, S.C. — Ron DeSantis is so desperate to save his failing campaign, he's lying about Nikki Haley's Social Security record AND his own. In his CNN town hall last night, DeSantis criticized Haley's plan for saving Social Security (which will start running out of money in 2033). He said: DESANTIS: So, what she has said, Nikki Haley, she has claimed that the retirement age is way, way, way too low. That's what she said. So, you got a lot of people that have worked hard their whole life. Life expectancy is declining in this country. It's tragic. But it's true. So, to look at those demographic trends, and say that, you would jack it up, so that people are not going to be able to have benefits? I mean, I don't know why she's saying that. You got to look at the trends. Lie #1: Ron DeSantis supports raising the retirement age. Congressman DeSantis voted for budget resolutions that would have raised the retirement age to 70 in 2013, 2014, and 2015. In 2012, Ron DeSantis told a local Florida newspaper that Social Security was unsustainable and was never intended for people to be retiring at ""65 or 67"" if they are going to live into their eighties.  DESANTIS: Now it's running a deficit, so there's nothing left in Social Security. It's guys like me pay into it, and then people who are on Social Security, the check immediately goes out to them. We're now taking in less than the checks are going out, and so that problem is going to get worse, but I think for people in my generation, my life expectancy–and again I wouldn't change it for people who are on it now–but my life expectancy is, it's improved. I was born in '78, and it's probably improved five or six years, just on average. That tends to annoy people when I tell them I'm gonna be around for a few more years longer, but it's true. And so, me getting Social Security at 65 or 67, if I'm gonna live for into my 80s, is probably not sustainable. When Social Security was created, the age that you received the benefit was actually higher than the life expectancy was. And so it was a, it was kind of a can't lose system from the government's perspective. They taxed everyone 1% and a lot of people that ended up getting anything. And I don't know if that was just the way because they wanted it to eventually evolve in the way it is now, but the system was not originally designed for people to be on it for 30 years. So we just have to understand that, that it's a mathematical problem. And to allow people like me, who have a lot longer to go, to be able to make some changes for us. Lie #2: DeSantis said that ""Life expectancy is declining in this country. It's tragic. But it's true."" This is false.  Life expectancy dropped during COVID but rebounded last year. When Social Security started, life expectancy was 58 for men and 62 for women. Today, life expectancy is 74 for men and 79 for women. Lie #3: DeSantis accused Haley of wanting to raise the retirement age for all retirees. False. Haley has ONLY called for adjusting the retirement age for younger workers in their twenties like her children.","","",""

Des Moines, IA - Ron DeSantis today joined KFAB's Morning News with Gary Sadlemyer and Jim Rose. The highlights are below. Listen to the full interview here. On why he embraces debates: Well, you know, we debated Gavin Newsom from California a couple of weeks ago. I think my view is I'll take on all-comers. I've got a great record, we've actually delivered on all the things Republicans have talked about for years and years, and we've got the formula to be a change agent in Washington and really change the trajectory of the country. So I'm happy to take that message all across the political spectrum. On how he continues to connect with voters in Iowa: If you look historically at the Iowa caucus, and you look at how they do these polls, the candidates that don't have the organization always way underperform whatever the poll says. If they're just, you know, spending money on TV, and doing that, that doesn't translate. And then the candidates that have the organization overperform what people are expecting. And so I went into this understanding how caucuses work, understanding the history of it, and saying, you know what, we need to be on the ground doing that. So we put a lot of time into it. And yeah, the thing is, you're going to some of these counties that are more rural, maybe. That's not going to show up in polling, right. I mean, that's not why you're doing that. You're doing that because you're showing up to their community. They remember, they get to ask you a question, shake your hands, and then when it comes time to caucus, they'll be like, yeah, you know what, I'm going to go for the governor, and then I'm going to bring my brother with me, I'm going to bring my son with me to also do it. And then you see the support materialize on caucus night. So we've done what needs to be done. Obviously, we have Governor Reynolds, who's a tremendous help. So that's what you want going into a caucus. On how his track record proves he's the best candidate for President: I think people know, with me, when I say I'm going to do something, I get the job done. Also, my electoral track record is second to none. Not just winning above what you're supposed to, but really shattering records in the state of Florida, And I've shown an ability to be able to do that. And then also just I'm in it for you, your family, and this country. I don't have my issues. It's not about me. I'm the vessel to be able to turn this country around.","","",""

A top moment of the night came when DeSantis said he is the only one running who made bold promised and delivered big results: VOTER: ""Do you think it's possible for the four candidates who made last Wednesday's debate stage to come together and throw your support behind one of you in an effort to create an actual competitor for President Trump?"" DESANTIS: ""Well, I appreciate that sentiment, Jessica. Well, look, I think that's what the Iowa caucuses, I think you guys choose who that person is. And I think I'm confident it's going to be me, because here's the thing, I'm the only one running that can beat Trump one-on-one. Why? Because the other candidates cannot get enough support from core Republicans and traditional conservatives to be able to go, you can't just win with a slice of the party, you've got to have broad support, we'll be able to do that going forward. And also, I think the reason why I think I should be the guy, we need a change agent in Washington, we don't want somebody that's just going to go up there and be part of the establishment, rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic. Now I want real serious structural change. I want to see term limits for members of Congress, I want to see a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, I want to see a line item veto for the President, I want to see agencies moved out of Washington, DC, into other parts of the country, I want to see a reduction in the scope of government. And that's going to take a leader that has backbone that's going to be willing to fight for you. And as a record of actually delivering big victories. I'm the only one running who's done 100% of my promises fulfilled in Florida. I'm also the only one running if you look at the folks that are doing the bad policies on the left that's causing the problems in the country. I'm the only one running who's beat these people. We beat the teachers union with school choice. We beat Fauci on COVID I beat Soros on the prosecutors, the left prosecutors that we remove, we beat the Dems on election integrity, so we have delivered victory after victory. That's what you deserve as the next President of the United States.""

Why should my employees trust you to return us to the prosperity that they enjoyed under President Trump?"" DESANTIS: ""Well, Tim, thanks for the question. I hope your business is doing well. I know things are tough right now with a lot of things. They could trust me for a couple of reasons. One, if you look at what we've done in Florida, our economy is ranked number one of all 50 states, we've boomed like we've never had, even in the face of all the inflation and the interest rates, which we have to obviously struggle with too. But our unemployment rate is 60% lower than states like California, which are peer states. I'd also say this, I think the first three years of the Trump administration, the economy is better than it has been. But that last year with COVID, I think was mishandled dramatically. Shutting down the country was a huge mistake. Printing trillions and trillions of dollars was a huge mistake. That set the foundation for the inflation that we see. Granted, Biden came in and poured gas on the fire, it was reckless that he did trillions. But if you look, you have trillions and trillions of dollars, of course, you're paying more for that. You're gonna have inflation when that happens. So I'm going to come in, we're gonna get the inflation down, we're going to open up energy so that you pay less for gas, and we're gonna get the interest rates down so you can actually do things like afford a home. So I think your hard-working employees are going to have a friend in the White House and I think we're going to be able to turn this country around.""

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show. The highlights are below. Listen to the full interview here. On his ground game and growing momentum in Iowa: One of the leading political leaders in Iowa, Bob Vander Plaats, head of The Family Leader, he's endorsed me. He ran for governor in 2010. The Des Moines Register poll the day before the primary had him down 30. He lost by two. And so I think that some of these things, the history of them has not been great, especially going from a caucus...we've already gotten tens of thousands of people that would exceed even what that poll said, and we're continuing to build every day...when we're able to go make the case in person, and sometimes that'll be at a diner with 30, 40 people, sometimes that'll be more of a rally where we have a couple 100 people, we're able to get people to come and caucus for us. So we're going to be working very hard on the ground. We're going to be doing that. But I think what all the polling shows, and I think Republicans have been burned by this, but if you do look underneath it, there's only two candidates that conservatives would be willing to support: Donald Trump and me. None of the other candidates, like Nikki Haley, can get support from conservatives. And ultimately, to win, to be a Republican nominee, you got to do well with Republicans and you got to do well with those who consider themselves conservative Republicans. On Gavin Newsom's wife throwing in the towel during their Fox News debate: We were standing at the podium. He [Hannity] said, 'You guys want to go?' I'm like, that's fine. And I guess we had already gone over the allotted 90 minutes. But it was fun. And that was pretty shortly after I did the San Francisco poop map, and showed that to everybody. And so that obviously was not a good moment for him. And so then we go to commercial break. And then there was a woman that came out and she said, 'Hard stop, hard stop. It's over. It's over.' I didn't necessarily know who it was at the time, but then come to find out that was his wife, that they didn't want to continue with the debates. I was 100% willing to continue with the debate. They didn't want to do it. But I think it was important to do the debate because one, they're [Democrats] are likely not going to run Biden if it doesn't look good for Biden. Newsom was kind of the guy waiting in the wings. I'm not sure after the debate, that that's someone that they may want to go with, but they're going to go with somebody that's going to be younger. And we just got to be prepared for that as Republicans. And I've always said that the problem with these Democrats is whoever runs besides Biden, Newsom had to had to hug Biden. We both Sean and I made him hug Biden. He said Biden gets an A plus great economy, all that. We all know that's not true. But if he would be the candidate, he would own all of Biden's policies, then he would have to own San Francisco and Los Angeles and California and the Exodus. So in that respect, that's a lot of baggage to be able to take into an election season. And I don't care how slick you are. I don't care how much of a of a snake oil salesman you are. Those facts do matter. On FSU being left out of the College Football Playoffs: This year was really the first time that we've competed any of our schools, at a really, really high level. So the fact that they won all their games -- and I understand they lost their quarterback who is a great player -- but my view would be if you win a power five conference, and you're undefeated, and there's only two other undefeated teams, you should be in one of the top four playoff spots. But I do think Florida State's got a good future ahead of them. You know, we'll see. Florida needs to get with the program, and Miami.","","",""

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined the Simon Conway Show live. The highlights are below. Listen to the full interview HERE. On liberal universities justifying comments about the genocide of Jews: How pathetic. Now, these are universities that will justify saying that it's okay to talk about the genocide of Jews because of quote, free speech, but they don't allow free speech on their universities. They have taken action against people, like Penn has taken action against faculty members or staff members who have opposed things like affirmative action and taking conservative positions on just run of the mill issues. So they have created a hotbed of radicalism at these universities. There's a sickness in these universities. You saw it on display there. You've seen it on display with these ridiculous protests in favor of Hamas that we've seen since October 7. But we've got to get smart about how we deal with these universities. We can't keep funding universities that are creating this type of toxic environment and toxic ideology. In Florida, I'm one of the few who have actually taken action. In our state, we passed legislation. All tenured professors, they have to undergo review every five years and can be let go for poor performance, particularly if they're spending all their time politicking. We also eliminated this DEI, which I know Iowa has now followed suit with. And that's kind of the root of some of this because they try to divvy up people based on race or ethnicity, and they create divisions where we should be judging people based on merit and based on the content of their character. So I think both of those presidents should be fired. But I think there's a larger task ahead of us. We give federal money to these universities in large numbers. And the question is, if this is the nonsense, and this is the crap that they're producing, why are we sending your tax dollars to them? On the upcoming CNN debate in Iowa: My view is, is I'm going to show up and debate. I don't know if any other candidate is accepted. My understanding is the only invited candidates would be Donald Trump, me and Haley. And I don't think Donald Trump's willing to debate it may be a one on one with me. And Haley. I don't know if he's accepted that. But my view is, is I want to go out there. I want to be able to contrast my successes and my leadership with the other candidates and show people that I'm the better choice. And so I'm willing to show up, wherever we're gonna go. I will tell you this. The RNC kind of took hold of the debate for precisely the reason you mentioned, but I'm not sure very many people were happy with how those debates turned out. In fact, I've had a lot of people tell me that the best debate of the cycle was not any of those primary debate. There was a debate I did against Gavin Newsom on Fox News with Sean Hannity that was substantive. Hannity wasn't doing gotcha. He was just teeing up all the important issues. And we were able to tussle back and forth. And I think we were really able to show that that conservative principles work and that freedom works and that the leftism that you see in California has not only failed California, it would fail this country. On his ground game in Iowa: I would just tell people, you know, some of the stuff that gets put out there, that's meant to create a narrative. I remember Bob Vander Plaats was down 30 points the day before the primaries 2010. He closed it to two. Most of these polls have not predicted the Iowa caucus winner, you know, we've got 10s of 1000s of people that have already committed to caucus ratting a lot every day. We're moving around the state, we're generating a lot of enthusiasm. The Governor's been a huge help to us. Vander Plaats has been a huge help. And then some of the more recent debates have been helpful, Newsom, and then the more recent one in Tuscaloosa. So we feel really good about the progress that we're making. Our data shows that it's very, very competitive. And no one's going to outwork us. I think that's the important thing. And what I find is when I go, I'll go maybe a small town, we'll get 100 people show up. There'll be people that are that want to vote for me anyways, there'll be some that are undecided and some may be leaning Trump. We flip a lot of those people once they're able to see me ask me questions and shake my hand. That's the way Iowa voters want it to be done. They want you to earn it, and we are going to earn it.","","",""

Nikki Haley's presidential campaign released an ad on Monday highlighting the results of a recent poll that showed her leading President Joe Biden by 17 points if she wins the GOP nomination. The ad compiled a collection of news hosts commenting on the dominating lead. The numbers came from a recent Wall Street Journal poll, which polled 1,500 registered voters and was released last week. The poll also saw former President Donald Trump beating Biden if the general election were held today — but only by 4 points. Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) tied the president. ""With Nikki Haley at the top of the ticket, Republicans will retire Joe Biden, retain the House, win the Senate, and win races up and down the ballot,"" Haley's spokesman Ken Farnaso told the Washington Examiner. ""She is the leader America needs to move on from the chaos and drama of the past and is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump and Joe Biden."" Haley received 51% of the vote in the poll, and Biden received 34%. However, Haley would need to secure the Republican nomination in order to face Biden. Haley also surpassed DeSantis in the poll, ranking second for the GOP primary with 15% of the vote, but she trailed Trump, who still holds a substantial lead for the nomination. DeSantis had 14%. The ad comes as the campaign gears up for the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary next month. Haley's campaign also released an ad on Friday that focused on her husband Michael Haley's service in the military. Friday's ad was part of the campaign's $10 million ad reservation, and it will air on broadcast, cable, and digitally. Monday's ad will only be released digitally.

Des Moines, IA - Ron DeSantis today joined Fox News Live. The highlights are below. Watch the full interview here. On the importance of school choice: Education is paramount. We see the problems with our universities. We see indoctrination in K through 12 schools. We see all the teachers' unions have had so much influence over K through 12 education. That has caused a lot of particularly low income kids to not have good opportunities. And so in Florida, we're a school choice state. We have universal choice. And you know what's happened? It's raised the bar for everyone. Our public school districts do better now, our charter schools do well, and then you can do private scholarships. So we're going to do something. It's going to be a tax credit program with corporate income tax. We're going to go over the heads of the teachers' union, so kids in Chicago and Philadelphia and all across the country are going to be able to be liberated from systems that have failed them and have failed this country. I don't think that it will ever happen locally because of how the political system has dominated with the unions. But I think if we do it nationally, I think it's going to be a breath of fresh air all across this country. On his momentum in Iowa and the importance of the caucus: So we've got the organization, we've got the grassroots, and really our task is to bring this in for a landing over the next five weeks. I can tell you that the interest in this has definitely picked up, because we've been here for many months coming. I think the last month or so the interest is picking up. And I think people are taking this process very, very seriously. They certainly don't believe a lot of what they hear in some of the national media that somehow we shouldn't even have a primary. They want to have this caucus, and they want their voice to be heard. On why he's the best candidate for President: We don't have till 2028. Now is the time, and that's why I ran, because I see the direction the country's going. We're in this period of decline thanks to left-wing policies, and we need somebody that's capable of winning the primary, the general, but then also delivering on these policies and implementing good conservative policy so we can reverse the country's decline. I'm the only one running who has a record of delivering on 100% of his promises, which I did in Florida. I'm also the only one running that has a record of defeating the people that have put us in this mess time and time again. I mean, we beat the teachers' unions in Florida by doing school choice, we beat Soros in Florida by getting rid of the Soros prosecutors and having low crime, we beat Disney on against the sexualization of minors, and we beat the Democrats on election integrity. So this is what we need, and that's why I'm running. But he is right. I'm not running for cabinet or any other office.","","",""

They said companies should focus on customers, workers and communities instead of being the best business possible. This has a nice sound to it but makes no sense. In reality, a company that cheats its customers, mistreats its workers and abuses its community won't be around long."" RON DeSANTIS Many DeSantis donors left his campaign and joined Haley because his campaign is a ""dumpster fire,"" according to his own allies. DeSantis didn't complain when the donors were with him. DeSantis tries to hide his donors. In May of this year, DeSantis signed a bill allowing him to conceal his own travel records – past, present and future – from public scrutiny. This came as DeSantis was making frequent trips out of state and preparing to launch a presidential campaign.  DeSantis recruited a group of wealthy hoteliers, developers, restaurateurs, investment brokers, trucking magnates, health executives, gas station and convenience store owners, and oil distributors to foot his travel bill. Some of them benefited from appointments to state boards and laws enacted by DeSantis.  According to the Washington Post: ""The undisclosed trips, which have not been previously reported, reflect how DeSantis fueled his political rise through close bonds with rich patrons and had a taste for luxury travel, in contrast to his campaign's portrayal of DeSantis's humble blue-collar roots and aversion to moneyed interests.""

The highlights are below. Watch the full interview HERE. On the importance of Mamas for DeSantis and out-of-state mamas' ability to volunteer for DeSantis in Iowa: FIRST LADY CASEY DESANTIS: We have now Mamas representation in all 99 counties in Iowa, and they are engaged to get out because they know there was only one person in this race, Republican, Democrat, Independent, who's going to stand up for the innocence of our kids, protect parents' rights, and that is Ron DeSantis. And so, we see a lot of momentum, of course, with Governor Reynolds coming out and supporting, Bob Vander Plaats, and people across the board. So I think it's going to be pretty exciting. And also, Martha, I tell you this, we have a huge coalition across the United States of America of mothers and grandmoms. When the governor was reelected, we had a coalition of 1.1 million mothers and grandmoms in the state of Florida. That was the largest that had ever been done in the history of our state, and probably, I would argue, across the nation. We're asking all of these moms and grandmoms to come from wherever it might be -- North Carolina, South Carolina -- and to descend upon the state of Iowa to be a part of the caucus because you do not have to be a resident of Iowa to be able to participate in the caucus. So moms and grandmoms are going to be able to come and be a part and let their voice be heard in support of Ron DeSantis. On Nikki Haley's inability to stand up for children: FIRST LADY CASEY DESANTIS: I think what you saw in the debate performance is she is not somebody who stands up for the rights of parents and the innocence of our children. And you saw that in very defining moments when we are talking about these surgeries on minors, these mutilations, she's in favor of that. The governor stands strong against that [and] signed legislation. On First Lady Casey DeSantis' active role in the campaign: FIRST LADY CASEY DESANTIS: I have a really unique perspective on the governor because I've been able to see him in front of the cameras, but also at home as the dad of a seven, five, and a three year old. I've seen him fight a lot of battles, whether it's fighting Fauci or fighting the teachers unions. And I've seen him conduct himself with grace and with strength and courage and never back down. And when you come from my perspective of seeing this, I feel it incumbent upon myself to get out to talk about him. It is not about us. It is about what we can do for the country. And when you see someone who I would consider my hero, I want to get out there and sing his praises. And I want the people of Iowa, New Hampshire, and beyond to know, this is the guy that we need at this moment in our nation's history. On ending the crisis at our southern border: GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS: We're going to declare the drug cartels to be foreign terrorist organizations. And when our forces or assets positively identify somebody as working with the cartels, then they would be somebody that we would be able to engage. But I've actually been down in parts of the border -- now most of the border is wide open, of course, but the parts where there is a fence, the cartels will just cut right through it. I mean, it's honestly pathetic that this is going on... Biden does not let people, our people be there to stop it. He has the border people off the wall, off the fence, and so this is happening. So, we're going to have all kinds of assets from drones, we're going to have intelligence. And I can tell you this, once you start showing that you're serious about this, you are going to see a change in behavior. They are poisoning our people.","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/369820",10121,"CHARLESTON, S.C. – Desperate Ron DeSantis has spun a web of lies—and the fact checkers agree. Here are the facts: Fact #1: Nikki Haley has never supported allowing minors to receive gender-changing surgeries. Fact #2: Ron DeSantis said in 2018 that getting involved in the ""bathroom wars"" wasn't ""a good use of our time."" Fact #3: Nikki Haley did not bring Confucius Institutes to South Carolina.  Post and Courier: Fact-checking the many attacks on Nikki Haley at the fourth GOP debate By: Alexander ThompsonOnline here It was a tussle in Tuscaloosa. The feisty fourth and final GOP presidential primary debate of the year at the University of Alabama featured plenty of attacks on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as she continues to cement her runner-up status over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. From the very first question, DeSantis and Ohio entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy started lobbing attacks at Haley, who almost always fought back with digs of her own. Some of it was true, some of it — less so. Transgender issues DeSantis' first attack on Haley came in her first answer of the night. ""She caves any time the left comes after her, any time the media comes after her. I did a bill in Florida to stop the gender mutilation of minors. It's child abuse and it's wrong. She opposes that bill,"" he said. ""She thinks it's fine and the law shouldn't get involved with it."" That's false. Haley opposes gender transition surgeries for minors. ""You shouldn't allow a child to have a gender-changing procedure until the age of 18 when they are an adult and they can make that decision,"" she said in a May ABC interview. At the debate, Haley clarified that this is what she had said. In a June CBS interview, she did say ""the law should stay out of it"" in reference to a question that asked generally about children who are questioning their gender identity. She almost immediately restated her position that once a child turns 18, ""if they want to make more of a permanent change, they can do that."" Despite much attention on the issue from conservatives, gender transition surgeries are rarely performed on minors nationally and are not provided by South Carolina hospitals. Bathroom bills Another of DeSantis' attacks was on Haley's opposition to a bill a South Carolina state senator proposed in 2016 that would have required people to use bathrooms that correspond with their gender assigned at birth in public schools and government buildings. ""They had a bill that tried to say men shouldn't go into girl's bathrooms, and she killed that bill, and she bragged that she killed that bill,"" DeSantis said. That's misleading. Haley said the bill wasn't ""necessary"" but did not ""kill"" it. Then-state Sen. Lee Bright, R-Roebuck, proposed the bill in April 2016 in the months following the passage of North Carolina's bathroom bill, which led to corporations boycotting the state and eventually played a role in that state's Republican governor's defeat later that year. Haley opposed Bright's bill. ""While other states are having this battle, this is not a battle that we have seen is needed in South Carolina,"" Haley said, according to The Post and Courier's previous reporting. ""And it's not something that we see the citizens are asking for in South Carolina."" Haley echoed those comments in Tuscaloosa. ""We had maybe a handful of kids who were dealing with an issue, and I said that we don't need to bring government into this,"" she said at the debate. Haley didn't kill the bill. Bright filed it late in the session, and it died in a Senate committee far from ever reaching Haley's desk. But Haley claimed credit for sidelining the bill in a 2022 interview at The Ronald Reagan Foundation & Institute. ""I remember a state senator in South Carolina filed a bill, and I strong-armed him, and I said 'we are not having that in South Carolina,'"" she said, going on to add that she supported transgender students using a private restroom in schools. In the debate Haley also counterattacked, saying that DeSantis said a bathroom bill ""wasn't a good use of time"" during his initial run for governor in 2018. That's true, he said that at a Florida Family Policy Council Event, though DeSantis did sign a bathroom bill earlier this year. Confucius Institutes Haley and DeSantis traded some well-worn barbs on China, but DeSantis pulled out a new one at the Dec. 6 debate. ""Nikki Haley brought Confucius Institutes to the universities in South Carolina,"" DeSantis said. ""That is not true,"" Haley protested. Haley's correct. Confucius Institutes were organizations operated and paid for by the Chinese government on college campuses to teach Mandarin and Chinese culture. About five years ago, concerns were raised that the institutes were spreading Chinese propaganda, and nearly all have since shut down. The University of South Carolina had a Confucius Institute, which launched in 2008 before Haley was governor, according to The State. It attracted little notice until after Haley left the governor's office and has since shuttered. Editor's note: This story has been updated to accurately reflect which South Carolina public colleges hosted Confucius Institutes. The Citadel's Mandarin initiatives launched in 2008 were funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, not the Chinese government.  Tampa Bay Times: Fact-checking DeSantis and Haley's attacks on each other over bathroom bills By: Grace AbelsOnline here Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis brought up bathroom access as one of many attacks on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the fourth Republican presidential primary debate. ""They had a bill to try to say that men shouldn't go into girls' bathrooms, and she killed that bill,"" DeSantis said. DeSantis has a point that the bill died and Haley had criticized it. But Haley — who said DeSantis criticized bathroom bills before he became governor — also has a point. As governor, Haley said in 2016 that she didn't believe it was ""necessary"" to pass a Senate bill that would have required people to use the bathroom that aligned with their sex assigned at birth. At the time, a similar law in North Carolina, HB 2, had sparked backlash and caused several businesses and artists to boycott the state. The South Carolina bill, which would have applied to public and school restrooms, stalled in committee, so it never reached Haley's desk. During the Dec. 6 debate in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Haley said she opposed the bill because of a lack of incidents involving transgender people in bathrooms. This was consistent with what The Washington Post reported in 2016 that she said at that time. In a 2022 appearance on Fox News, she again said she ""strong-armed"" the bill, adding that schools should resolve the issue with parents. Haley lobbed a similar accusation at DeSantis: ""When he was running for governor and they asked him about that, he said he didn't think bathroom bills were a good use of his time."" Her campaign cited a clip of DeSantis from his 2018 run for Florida governor in which he said at a campaign event that he would ""not pass a law"" restricting bathroom access. DeSantis said in the clip that ""getting into the bathroom wars — I don't think that's a good use of our time."" Flash forward: In May 2023, DeSantis signed a law that restricts transgender people from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity in public schools, universities, government buildings and prisons, the Tampa Bay Times reported.  FactCheck.org: DeSantis Distorts Haley's Position on Gender-Affirmation Surgery for Minors By: Eugene Kiely, D'Angelo Gore, Robert Farley, Saranac Hale Spencer, Jessica McDonald, Alan Jaffe, and Lori RobertsonOnline here DeSantis claimed that Haley opposed a bill he signed prohibiting gender-affirming surgeries — or as he put it, ""gender mutilation"" — for minors. That's a distortion of Haley's position. Haley has said any ""permanent change"" for transgender people should only be allowed after a child has turned 18. DeSantis raised the issue twice in the debate, both times leading to fiery exchanges in which Haley said DeSantis was distorting her position and DeSantis insisted he had video evidence to back up his claim. In May, DeSantis signed into law a bill that prohibited ""sex-reassignment prescriptions and procedures for patients younger than 18 years of age."" The ban includes both surgeries as well as puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. The video evidence DeSantis cites to back up his claim about Haley is an interview she did with CBS News on June 5, but he's cherry-picking her response. In the interview, CBS News' Tony Dokoupil asked Haley ""what care should be on the table when a 12-year-old child in this country assigned female at birth says, 'actually I feel more comfortable living as a boy.' What should the law allow the response to be?"" ""I think the law should stay out of it and I think parents should handle it. This is a job for the parents to handle,"" Haley said. ""And then when that child becomes 18, if they want to make more of a permanent change, they can do that. But I think up until then, we see with our teenage kids, they go through a lot during puberty. They go through a lot of confusion, they go through a lot of anxiety, they go through a lot of pressures. We should support them the whole way through, but we don't need to go and enforce something in schools. We don't need schools sitting there hiding from the parents what gender pronoun they are using. We don't need to have those conversations in schools. Those are conversations that should be had at home."" A super PAC backing DeSantis also cited to us comments Haley made in a June 4 CNN town hall when speaking on the transgender issue. ""I want everybody to live the way they want to live,"" Haley said. ""Let's get them the help, the therapy, whatever they need so that they can feel better and not be suicidal."" In neither case did Haley advocate gender-affirming procedures for minors. In fact, in a May 3 interview with ABC News, Haley specifically said, ""You shouldn't allow a child to have a gender-changing procedure until the age of 18 when they are an adult.""","","",""

As a submarine officer in the U.S. Navy for 20 years, I had the honor of relieving the watch and turning over the watch hundreds of times as we conducted missions vital to our national security around the globe. I learned quickly that not all watches are the same, and that the state of affairs of the submarine at the time of turnover largely determines what will be required of the new team that takes the watch. America's next commander-in-chief will relieve the watch in an incredibly perilous time for our country. President Joe Biden will turn over to our next president a dangerous world. We have Europe's largest war since WWII raging in Ukraine, a Middle Eastern conflict on the verge of engulfing the region and a Pacific theater on the cusp of military conflict with China. The world has rarely been a more dangerous place, and America's position is the weakest it's been since Dec. 6, 1941. America needs a commander-in-chief who has the moral clarity to know good from evil, the pragmatic experience to get things done, and the human touch to bring America together. Nikki Haley is the right person for the job. Nikki Haley is the one person running for president who has consistently shown moral clarity. She identifies the threats to America (China, Russia, an open border and Iran all top the list), and displays an authentic understanding of the actions required to strengthen our national security. Haley has made it clear that as commander-in-chief, she will confront the present crises while positioning America to ensure tomorrow's security.  As the wife of a deployed soldier, she feels today's dangers. Nikki Haley knows appeasement, cash, and whispers will not deter an evil actor like Iran from attacking our troops. Strength and action are required. She understands the most consequential issue that our next president will navigate is whether or not we end up in a war with China. Haley appreciates that a war with China is not going to be decided by tanks on a battlefield in Taiwan or even by an aircraft carrier in the Western Pacific. She has articulated that war with China will ultimately be determined (and, God willing, deterred) in the space, cyber, AI, and undersea domains. Americans cannot afford to elect a leader who will get this issue wrong. Americans feel the uncertainty and danger present in the world today. Seventy-eight percent of U.S. adults believe their children's generation will be worse off than theirs. That means 78 percent of Americans believe that we are leading our kids in the wrong direction. How did this happen? America is the greatest country this world has ever experienced. We are the most generous, the most diverse, the most advanced, the richest in natural resources, and the most sought-after country to live in — the land of freedom and opportunity. Yet, even with all that, 78 percent of Americans feel we are on a downward path. Are we really willing to turn over to our children a country in decline and a world that is less safe than we experienced? Not on Nikki's watch. Nikki Haley knows America's national security is not just a campaign talking point to dust off every four years. Our nation's security is the foundation upon which Americans build their lives and dreams. America is in desperate need of a new leader, a new leader from a new generation with a new vision of America for Americans. A leader ready to lead, ready to unite, and ready to right the ship on day one. Governor Nikki Haley has led. She led South Carolina to become an economic beast, bringing a record number of jobs, investments, and educational opportunities to her state. Ambassador Nikki Haley has united. She went head-to-head with the world's worst dictators to build coalitions at the UN to hold China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea accountable. Mrs. Haley is ready to take the helm and steer our America back on course. She feels what American families are feeling, she understands American's dissatisfaction, and she knows how to win. President Nikki Haley will ""preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States"" and reignite the spirit of the American Dream.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/369160",6973,"""As a party, if we can't stand for the well-being of children, then what good are we?"" Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis this morning joined both Fox & Friends and Salem Radio's The Hugh Hewitt Show following his victory in the fourth RNC debate last night. The highlights are below. Watch the full interview on Fox & Friends here. On how parents do not have the right to abuse their kids: Chris and Nikki both support these gender transition surgeries for minors. That's mutilation. We passed legislation in Florida saying you cannot do that. They say, oh, it's parents' rights. You don't have a right to abuse your kid as a parent. And that was very telling when we did that on the stage. So as a party, if we can't stand for the well-being of children, then what good are we? We know the Democrats won't. I did the debate against Gavin Newsom. California has laws, kids can go behind their parent's backs from other states, minors, and get this transition surgery... You don't have a right to abuse your kids. That's been the law for forever. You know, you can't take a 12 year old and get them a tattoo, it's just, you got to be a certain age. But yet somehow you can chop off their private parts? Give me a break. And you know, what Nikki said in there, it shows you, first of all, she was talking about a different bill, our parents' rights in education, which had nothing to do with this. So she was dissembling because she knows she's not good. She called it the don't say gay bill. That's what the Liberals tried to call it. That is a false narrative. That's what the corporate media does. And it shows she buys into these left-wing narratives, the fact that she used that term for that bill, which had nothing to do with the mutilation. But they believe that somehow this is a parent right, even though it's irreversible, and it's very damaging, and many other countries have said we can't do it. On how he's inspired by Calvin Coolidge: Calvin Coolidge was probably the most constitutionally sound president we've had in the last 100 years. When he was president, the country did very well. He was right on almost every issue that he tackled. He had a very successful presidency. You know, and he's kind of, you know, he wasn't as flashy or whatever, but he got the job done, and he understood that. And there's a story, famous story, because he was known as silent Cal, there was a woman that went up to him. She said, Mr. President, I have a bet that I could get you to say more than two words. He looked at her, deadpanned, and said, you lose. On how Nikki Haley is not the conservative she says she is: They're spending millions of dollars trying to attack me, so of course we're going to fight back. The surge is more of a media thing. You're not seeing it on the ground with conservative voters. In fact, conservative voters don't support her. I mean, that's just the reality. But people are responsible for their record. She runs saying she's so tough on China. She was the number one governor in South Carolina when she was there of bringing China into her state. We posted the letter on our website where she was saying how great they were to the ambassador, and then the video of her in front of a Chinese flag at this Chinese company in South Carolina, where she says that she works for them now as governor. And so that's just the reality. Now she's singing a different tune. But notice, she was really bragging about these liberal Wall Street donors who are now supporting her. These are people that supported Hillary Clinton. These are people that have opposed Donald Trump in the past. They will not allow strong policies. Listen to part one of the interview with Hugh Hewitt here and part two here. On Ivy League schools' refusal to condemn Hamas: I think what this is revealed is the rot and the sickness that's been festering inside higher education for a long time. And you understand that, Hugh, a lot of your listeners do. But I think now the broader public is seeing this and I think that they're appalled by what was going on. And I would put in a plug for Florida, and say how we've done it differently. If you look at how, say, Ben Sasse, who's the president of the University of Florida, has handled the post October 7th, matters, much different moral clarity, things that you can be proud of. And we need universities that are going to serve a function of pursuing truth and preparing students to be citizens of the Republic. They should not be these hotbeds of anti-Americanism and antisemitism but that's what they become. And I think back to my time, and I joke when I'm out on the campaign trail speaking with Republican primary voters, I say, 'listen, I'm one of the few people that have gone through both Harvard and Yale and came out more conservative than when I went in.' That's not easy to do. And everyone acknowledged that, they all kind of get it. But back in my day, you would not have had, I think, this level of vitriol like you have now. It has gotten much worse. On participating in more debates: I do think we are going to have debate, I think we're going to have a debate in Iowa. And I think we're going to have a debate in New Hampshire. I don't know that the RNC is going to put it on. But I don't think that they're going to block it. And we need to do that in those two early states, I think it's very important. Hopefully, they'll raise the thresholds for qualifying. And it may end up just being a one on one debate. And of course, if the former President is willing to show up and debate, then doing three I think would be really, really good but it's an important part of the process. On how he will de-politicize the DOJ: We're going to have an attorney general that's going to set the tone and do it. I think you need to move parts of justice outside of Washington, DC. I mean, for example, put the Civil Rights Division in Oklahoma or Arkansas, I think that that will draw different types of people. I don't think the very partisan DC lawyers would be willing to move and go out there. So you're going to have an opportunity to have some significant turnover, but it can't just be-- yes, you need a strong Attorney General. Yes, you need strong deputies. And you have to fill those positions, you have to send those nominations on January 3rd of 2025 when the new senate is sworn in, you got to be ready to go. And there's no substitute for that. But the big problem with Justice is the career folks are very partisan and the media likes to say, 'well, their career, they're not political.' No. The fact that they're career, that doesn't mean that they don't have an agenda, it just means they're not political appointees, but 99% of the political donations from rank and file people at DOJ go to Democrats. So how can you say that somehow, it's not politicized. So it is, so I think the problem is much deeper than just the upper echelon, and we're going to have to get in there and do something about it.","","",""

Fox and Friends   We have a country to save... ""My focus is we have a country to save. We've got an economy where inflation is high. Every one of these students are wondering how they're going to be able to afford a home. They want to know how they're going to pay off their student loans. They want to know how they're going to continue to get a job. Those are things we have to be focused on. We're worried about crime in our streets or fentanyl crossing the border or a border that's out of control. There are a lot of issues and that's why we're surging in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. It's because we're talking about the issues that matter to normal people, not to people who are trying to do things for other reasons. And that's the focus that I've got and that's the focus we'll keep."" On the farce of the UN... ""The United Nations continues to show they're a farce. They continue to show that they have no credibility. This is why I call them out constantly on human rights issues, because they claim they're for human rights. But when it comes to really fighting for those that are suffering, they don't do it. I mean, here you have so many women and girls that were not only raped, but their naked bodies were dragged through the streets of Gaza. Now we hear that they were mutilated, and we hear that they were abused in a horrific fashion, and to not be able to say that that was brutality and torture at an evil level, says so much more about them than it says about the civilized people in civilized countries. So it's a shame. It's why they're not relevant. It's why they have an issue."" Varney: ""You clearly had a target on your back last night.""   On her opponents' attacks... ""When you start getting attacked, that means you're surging, and we know that. We see it in the polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. People relate to the fact that we need an accountant in the White House. They relate to the fact that the economy is out of control, there's lawlessness on the border, that we need to get our kids reading again, and that we've got wars around the world, and they want to stop the chaos and they want some stability. And that's what we want to bring, we want to make sure that we get a new generational leader that's going to get America back on track, and I think the people see that, and certainly my opponents saw that last night."" On expanding the Republican tent...  ""We have over 150,000 donors, so I don't know all of them. I haven't talked to all of them... Every one of those guys on the stage would love to have the endorsements. Americans for Prosperity, the largest conservative grassroots group in the country, endorsed me last week and Ron DeSantis hit them afterwards when he was trying to fight just as hard for it. They all want these endorsements. What I do know is, we have a country to save—and Republicans have lost the last seven out of eight popular votes for president. That's nothing to be proud of. I want to win Republicans. I want to win Democrats. I want to win Independents. I was a conservative governor. I was a tough UN ambassador, and I'm gonna be a good president that serves the people in our country and makes America strong again. And I'm not gonna push supporters away. I'm gonna bring people in because we've got to bring America back on track and that's why I crushed Joe Biden by 10 to 13 points in every poll.""","","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/370181",6300,"The claims by a super PAC that backs Gov. Ron DeSantis comparing Nikki Haley to Hillary Clinton are misleading. By: Angelo FicheraOnline here In Republican politics, being likened to a prominent Democrat like Hillary Clinton may well be among the highest of insults. Some G.O.P. presidential hopefuls and their allies are seizing on that comparison to denounce Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina who has gained momentum in the primary race. During the Republican debate in Alabama on Wednesday, for example, the entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy criticized Ms. Haley for giving ""foreign multinational speeches like Hillary Clinton."" In particular, though, supporters of Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida have leveraged that line of attack, including in advertisements by a pro-DeSantis super PAC, Fight Right. But the ads trying to tie Ms. Haley to Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, make claims that are misleading. Here's a fact-check of some of those claims. WHAT WAS SAID""We know her as Crooked Hillary, but to Nikki Haley, she's her role model, the reason she ran for office."" — Fight Right in an advertisement This is misleading. Ms. Haley has said on multiple occasions over the years — including in a 2012 interview with The New York Times — that Mrs. Clinton inspired her to run for office. Specifically, a speech by Mrs. Clinton in which she discussed the importance of women in public office was a motivating force. But Ms. Haley has also emphasized their policy differences, which the ad omits, and spoke out against the prospect of Mrs. Clinton winning the presidency in 2016. The ad at one point shows Ms. Haley saying, ""I often say that the reason I got into politics was because of Hillary Clinton."" But the ad omits criticism of Mrs. Clinton that Ms. Haley included in that remark, which is from an interview in July 2020 with the Women & Politics Institute at American University. Asked to share her thoughts on the women who ran for president in the 2020 Democratic primary and perceptions around their electability, Ms. Haley replied: ""I think that we had some strong women that ran for office. And I respect any man or woman that puts their hat in the ring. I really respect all the women that put their hat in the ring."" She continued, ""You know, I often say that the reason I got into politics — believe it or not, I don't agree with anything that she has to say — but it was because of Hillary Clinton."" Ms. Haley then referred to a speech Mrs. Clinton gave in 2003 to Furman University, in Greenville, S.C. ""She was the one that said for all the reasons people tell you you shouldn't run, those are the reasons you should. And I walked out of there and decided to run for the statehouse,"" Ms. Haley said. Ms. Haley was elected to South Carolina's House of Representatives in 2004. WHAT WAS SAID""Haley raised taxes like Hillary."" — Fight Right in an ad This is misleading. The ad cites a bill that South Carolina lawmakers passed in 2006 that raised the state sales tax by one percentage point. But that measure also exempted owner-occupants from paying property taxes for schools, among other provisions. Ms. Haley was a co-sponsor of the legislation. The legislation was described by experts as a ""tax swap"" and an analysis at the time projected that most homeowners would have an overall decreased tax burden. ""This was a tax swap, not a tax increase,"" Jared Walczak, the vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. ""It's fair to question whether the swap was a good one, particularly the policy of exempting homeowners from school property taxes, while leaving them on commercial property, including rental properties. But it is inaccurate to characterize the legislation a tax hike."" Tax overhaul measures often include increasing revenues in one area to pay down reductions elsewhere, Mr. Walczak said in an email. ""If the net effect is revenue neutral or a reduction in collections, such policies are not conventionally viewed as raising taxes."" He added, ""Such a definition would allow significant tax cuts, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act adopted during the Trump administration, to be characterized as raising taxes."" The Fight Right ad also cites an article by Fox Business in the fall about Ms. Haley and South Carolina's gas tax — the subject of misleading claims by another pro-DeSantis super PAC. Ms. Haley did not increase the gas tax as governor. She resisted calls to raise the gas tax as a stand-alone measure, but proposed raising the tax only if the state also reduced the income tax rate to 5 percent, from 7 percent, and made changes to the state's Transportation Department. Fight Right did not respond to requests for comment. WHAT WAS SAIDNikki Haley ""backs open borders like Hillary."" — Fight Right in an ad This is false. There is no evidence that Ms. Haley supports ""open borders."" In fact, she has repeatedly called for the United States to close the southern border. In April, Ms. Haley posted a video on social media while visiting the southern border and criticized chain-link fencing as insufficient. ""We need to finish what we started, whether it's this or this — we need something,"" Ms. Haley said, motioning to a portion of the wall that she said had been built under the Trump administration as well as a tall fencing system. ""But a chain-link fence, that's not going to stop anybody and that's why we see so many illegal immigrants coming across."" During her campaign for the Republican nomination, Ms. Haley has proposed reworking the immigration system to legally admit people to the country based on merit, rather than quotas. ""Now, when it comes to legal immigration, it's a broken system — it shouldn't take someone 10 years to become a citizen,"" Ms. Haley said last month in New Hampshire. ""But what we need to do is reform it."" ""So for too long, Republican and Democrat presidents dealt with immigration based on a quota,"" she said. ""We'll take X number this year, we'll take X number next year. The debate is on the number. It's the wrong way to look at it. We need to do it based on merit. We need to go to our industries and say what do you need that you don't have? So think agriculture, think tourism, think tech. We want the talent that's going to make us better.""","","",""
