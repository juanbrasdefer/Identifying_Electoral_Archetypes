Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/374521",13437,"THE VICE PRESIDENT  Hi   Applause   Oh  good afternoon  everybody  Good afternoon  Good afternoon  It is my great honor to be with everybody this afternoon  Matt  I want to thank you for your leadership and for all that you do for so many  You know  everyone here  you all have chosen to live a life of service in the most extraordinary way  And I m so thankful to all of you   to Matt  for your leadership   and everybody here  And it is so good to be in the house of labor  Thank you all   Applause   Thank you all  Thank you all  And  you know  yours is a profession that is more than a profession  It really is about a calling  You know  my   I was just telling Matt   my brother in law just retired as a firefighter in California  So  for me  this is personal and it is professional  I know what you guys do  and I know your character  I know your families  I know what it means for the whole community for you all to take on the lives that you have decided to live  and I m so thankful to you  You guys work long shifts with unpredictable hours in some of the most dangerous conditions  You do so on behalf of people you ve never met  Sometimes  those people will never know your name  but because of what you do with such sincerity and the highest level of skill and professionalism  their lives are forever better  And they always know and have the comfort of going to sleep at night knowing that should any tragedy come their way that you guys are out there and would be there  It s an extraordinary thing you do  and it s a great gift that you have that you give  And so  I am so thankful to you  Thank you   Applause   And  of course  I am thankful for the union that supports you and your right to all that you deserve in terms of the wages and the benefits that you so rightly have earned   Applause   And I also want to thank the other brothers and sisters from labor who are here from UAW    applause   IBE    IBEW  LIUNA  Where are your orange T shirts  I know you re here somewhere  I thank you all  all of you  So  look  just yesterday  we saw another example of the power of collective bargaining   right    when the longshoremen and the U S  Maritime Alliance came together  ended a strike  and reached an agreement on a record wage  Right   Applause   They did good  They did good  And I say  everywhere I go  look  collective bargaining benefits everybody  And you know the   the term   and I m looking at our young leaders who are here  I m so glad you guys are here   Applause   So  collective bargaining  it s really   it s just a basic logical point  So  here s what it means  It means that in any negotiation  you want the outcome to be fair  Right  We all want fairness  right  Everybody wants fairness   or should  So  here s the thing about collective bargaining  If you want the outcome to be fair  you got to realize  if you re requiring the one worker to negotiate against the big entity  do we really think that the outcome is going to be fair  Probably not  But if you let the workers together  as the collective  then negotiate against the big entity  it s more likely that the outcome will be fair  That s the basic point of collective bargaining  That s the basic point of why we want our unions to be able to do their work on behalf of workers every day  because we know when union wages go up  everyone s wages go up   Applause   Yeah  And when union workplaces are safer  all workplaces are safer   Applause   And the bottom line is  When unions are strong  America is strong   Applause   And our unions have always fought to make our nation  then  more equal  more fair  and more free  And in this election  in 32 days  everything we have fought for is on the line  This election is about two very different visions for our nation  one that is focused on the past  and ours that is focused on the future  We fight for a future where we protect the fundamental freedom to organize  We fight for a future where workers  all workers  are treated with dignity and respect  a future where we tap into the ambition and the aspirations of the American people and build what I call an  opportunity economy  so that every American has an opportunity to buy a home  start a business  build wealth   intergenerational wealth for their family  Over the last three and a half years  our nation has seen historic small business creation as an example of that focus  In Michigan alone  we have seen more than 500 000 new small business applications  And when I am president  I plan to build on that progress and that success  including by raising the start up deduction   tax deduction for small businesses from $5 000 for   to $50 000 to help more entrepreneurs start a small business  I ll tell you guys  my sister and I were raised by our mother  who worked very hard  and we lived on an apartment above a daycare center  And it was run by and owned by the woman that we called our second mother  who lived two houses down  She was a small business owner  and her name was Ms  Shelton  And I grew up as a child knowing about who our small businesses are  right  They re leaders in the community  They re civic leaders  They hire locally  They train  And so  that s one of the reasons I m focused on small businesses as part of how we lift up the middle class in America s economy  We need to also build more housing in America  Housing is too expensive  My mother saved up for years  until I was a teenager  when she was able to buy our first home  And right now  we have a serious housing shortage in America  and that s part of what is driving up costs  And so  we are going to cut red tape  we re going to work with the private sector  and we ll build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term    applause    including   including providing first time homebuyers with a $25 000 down payment assistance so they can just get their foot literally in the door to be able to invest in the American dream    applause    which not everyone has access to these days  We need to lower the cost of living  because  look  our economy  while we re making good progress   just this morning  in fact  we got a solid jobs report  over 250 000 jobs created last month  unemployment fell  And just a few weeks ago  the Federal Reserve cut down interest rates  which is going to be great for a lot of folks  But there s still more work we need to do  Prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high  You know it  and I know it  And so  we have a plan to lower costs on everything from health care to groceries  including what I ve done in my career as attorney general  which is we got to take on corporate price gouging  We got to take on what we need to do to understand that if you want to grow the middle class  we need more middle class tax cuts  And the tax cut that is part of my plan will give a tax cut to 100 million Americans  We need to expand Child Tax Credit  and I will do that to expand it to $6 000 so that for the first year of a child s life  their parents have the resources that they need to be able to buy a crib or a car seat  and in that very critical stage of their child s development  just be able to do more than get by but be able to get ahead  And I say all this to say  I will always put the middle class and working families first  I come from the middle class  and I will never forget where I come from  I will never forget where I come from   Applause   And we know we cannot have a strong middle class without American manufacturing  Over the last three and a half years  we brought manufacturing back to America  We created 730 000 manufacturing jobs and announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States  And we did it by investing in American industry and American workers  And I want to make sure that America  not China  wins the competition for the 21st century   Applause   So  under my plan  we will invest in the industries that built America  like steel  iron  and the great American auto industry    applause    yeah   so we can ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs  from advanced batteries to electric vehicles  are not only invented but built right here in America by American union workers   Applause   So  the election is in 32 days  and Americans have a big choice to make  And I think it s very important  then  to point out Donald Trump has a very different approach than mine  And let s be real about who Donald Trump is  Let s be real  This is a time for real talk  He was handed $400 million on a silver platter and filed for bankruptcy six times  This is a man who has only ever fought for himself  This is a man who has been a union buster his entire career  who has called union leaders  quote   Dues Sucking  people  And as president  he did not lift a finger to save the pensions of millions of American workers  We did  We did   Applause   This is a man who sold promise after promise to American workers but never delivered  who said he supports so called right to work laws  100 percent   Those are his words  He who joked and laughed about firing striking workers  You remember that  AUDIENCE  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Who rolled back labor standards and made it easier for companies that break labor laws to get federal contracts  And Donald Trump is a man who tried to cut funding for our first responders  including SAFER grants for firefighters  So  brothers and sisters  as we stand here in a house of labor  we will not be fooled  We will not be gaslighted  Donald Trump s track record is a disaster for working people  and he s trying to gaslight people all over our country  But we know the facts and we know the truth  He is an existential threat to America s labor movement  Just look at his track record to know  He said he was the only one who could bring back America s manufacturing jobs   Michigan knows what I m about to say   then America lost nearly 200 000 manufacturing jobs when he was president  including tens of thousands of jobs in Michigan  And those losses started before the pandemic  so we re clear  making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs in American history   Applause   And recall his record   his track record for the auto industry  He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would  quote   not lose one plant  during his presidency  Then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president  including General Motors in Warren and Stellantis in Detroit  Thousands of Michigan autoworkers lost their jobs  And now he is making the same empty promises to the people of Michigan that he did before  hoping you will forget how he let you down  But we know  if he wins again  it will be more of the same  Everything he intends to do is spelled out in Project 2025  If reelected  he intends to launch a full on attack on unions and the freedom to organize  He will ban public sector unions  roll back workplace safety protections  and appoint a union buster to run the Department of Labor  And on top of that  Donald Trump will give billionaires and the biggest corporations massive tax cuts like he did last time  He will cut Social Security and Medicare and impose what I call a Trump sales tax  a 20 percent tax on everyday goods and necessities  which will cost   the economists have said   which will cost the average American over $4 000 a year more  And if that weren t enough  he intends to end the Affordable Care Act  And even after he tried to repeal it time and time again when he was president  he still has no plan to replace it  Did you guys see the debate   Laughter and applause    Concepts of a plan   He has  concepts of a plan    Laughter   Come on  And  you know  I ve said many times he is an unserious human    laughter    but the consequence of him is quite serious  because think about that   concepts of a plan   So  he s going to threaten the health care and health coverage of 45 million people in America based on a concept   think about that   to take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions  You remember what that was like  So  look  I m here to say  and I think we all know  It s time to turn the page  It s time to turn the page   Applause   We re not going back  America is ready to chart a new way forward  because we are not going back  AUDIENCE MEMBER  No  we re not  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  No  we re not  And so  it all comes down to this  We are here together because we know what is at stake  And we are here together   and I m looking at the young leaders   because we love our country  We love our country   Applause   Yes  we do  We love our country  And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America  We have 32 days to get this done  and we know this is going to be a very tight race until the very end  And we are the underdog  so we have some hard work ahead of us  But I know who s here  We like hard work  Hard work is good work  Hard work is good work   Applause   And we know what we stand for  so we know what to fight for  We stand for opportunity  we stand for dignity  and we stand for the future  And so  we know when we fight   AUDIENCE  We win  THE VICE PRESIDENT    we win  God bless you  God bless the United States of America   Applause   Thank you all  Thank you  Thank you   Applause  ","","",""

Applause   Hey  everyone  Can we hear it for Eric Price   Applause   Oh  it s good to be back in Michigan  Thank you all so very much   Applause   Thank you  Thank you so very much  And  Eric Price  thank you for your leadership of UAW 651  and all the work that you do   Applause  And I want to thank all the leaders who are here  This is   I mean  this is   we ve got thousands of leaders who are here  and I thank them    applause    including all our friends in labor  Shawn Fain  April Verrett    applause   all of the incredible elected leaders  starting with the Governor Whitmer  who is amazing and is my friend   my dear friend    applause   Mayor Neeley  Senator Stabenow  Senator Peters  Representative Slotkin  who we will elect to the United States Senate   Applause   And did you all see Magic Johnson   Laughs    Applause   Remember his number  32  Today we got 32 days until the election   Laughs    Applause   So  32 days   32 days  AUDIENCE MEMBERS   Inaudible   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Okay  We got some business to do  We got some business to do  All right  Thirty two days  And we know we will do it   Applause   And   and this is going to be a very tight race until the very end  This is going to be a very tight race until the very end  We are the underdog  and we know we have some hard work ahead  But here s the thing about us  We like hard work   Applause   We like hard work  Hard work is good work  Hard work is good work   Applause   And with your help  in November  we will win  We will win   Applause   We are not playing around  So  listen  we know this election is about two very different visions for our nation  one focused on the past  and ours  which is focused on the future   Applause   We are fighting for a future where we tap into the ambitions and the aspirations of the American people and build what I call an  opportunity economy  so every American has an opportunity to own a home  build wealth  start a business   Applause   And I m going to speak about small   do we have small business owners in the house right here   Applause   Right  Okay  So  on the economy  I m just going to spend a minute on small businesses  So   so   because let me tell you  So  growing up  our mother often worked very long hours  and so my sister  Maya  and I  we would go over to Ms  Shelton s house  Ms  Shelton was from Louisiana  and we called her our second mother  And Ms  Shelton was a small business owner  And so  from being a child  I know who our small business owners are  They are community leaders  civic leaders  They mentor  They hire locally  They build up the community  They are part of the fabric of the community   Applause   And small business owners are the backbone of America s economy   Applause   So  in my plan to build an opportunity economy  one of the things I will do is raise the start up deduction from $5 000 to $50 000 to help entrepreneurs start their small business   Applause   You heard Eric talk about it  We need to build more housing in America   Applause   You know  my mother saved up for years to buy our first homes  I was a teenager by the time she saved up enough to do that  And right now  we know there s a serious housing shortage in our country  and it is part of what is driving up costs  So  we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes and provide first time homebuyers with a $25 000 down payment assistance    applause    so you can just literally get your foot in the door  and you ll handle the rest  We need to lower the cost of living  Look  our economy is making good progress  Just this morning  we got a solid jobs report  right   Applause   Over 250 000 jobs created last month  unemployment fell  and just a few weeks ago  the Federal Reserve cut interest rates  which helps   Applause   But there s still more we need to do  Prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high  You know it and I know it  And I have a plan on lowering costs on everything from health care to groceries  including taking on corporate price gouging   Applause   Because as attorney general  I saw what happens where   there are few of them  they don t   not everybody but those who take advantage of desperate people   in particular  in the middle of an emergency   and there needs to be consequence   Applause   I will give a tax cut to 100 million Americans  including $6 000 extending and expanding the Child Tax Credit  so during the first year of a child s life    applause    young parents have the support they need to be able to buy a car seat  to buy a crib  to take care of their child during that first year of their life  knowing it s about setting them on a path to do everything they have a natural desire to do  And  look  let me   I say all this to say  I will always put the middle class and working families first  I come from the middle class  and I will never forget where I come from   Applause   I will never forget where I come from  And we know we cannot have a strong middle class without American manufacturing  So  over the last three and a half years  we have brought manufacturing back to America  creating 730 000 manufacturing jobs   Applause   We announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States   Applause   And we did it by investing in American industry and American workers   Applause   And I will make sure that America   not China   wins the competition for the 21st century    applause    which is why  under my plan  we will invest in the industries that built America  like steel  iron  and the great American auto industry  I see you  Shawn   Applause   And we will ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs  from advanced batteries to electric vehicles  are not only invented but built right here in America by American union workers   Applause   And  Michigan  let us be clear  Contrary to what my opponent is suggesting  I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive   Applause   But here s what I will do  I will invest in communities like Flint    applause    Flint  which helped build the auto industry and the UAW   Applause   We will retool existing factories  hire locally  and work with unions to create good paying jobs  including jobs that do not require a college degree    applause    because we understand a college degree is not the only measure of whether a worker has skills and experience to get the job done   Applause   In fact  part of my plan is to outline all of the federal jobs that should not require a college degree and make that clear  And when I m elected  I m going to challenge the private sector to take on the same approach   Applause   And then there s Donald Trump  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  So  Donald Trump has a very different approach  So  Donald Trump makes big promises  and he always fails to deliver   Applause   He said he was the only one who could bring back America s manufacturing jobs  Remember that  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And then America lost nearly 200 000 manufacturing jobs when he was president   AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT    including   including tens of thousands of jobs in Michigan  And those losses started before the pandemic  making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers    applause    of manufacturing jobs in American history  And his track record for the auto industry was a disaster  He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would  I ll quote   not lose one plant  during his presidency  And then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president  We need a medic over here  We need a medic over here  Right here  Okay  Can everyone part so the medic can come through  please  Let s   let s let the medic through   Applause   AUDIENCE MEMBER  He s okay  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Okay  He s okay  Okay  Okay  He s okay  All right  We re good  We got each other   Applause   Good  Good  Good  So  remembering  again  what Donald Trump talked about versus what he did  Then automakers   American automakers announced the closure of six plants when he was president  including General Motors in Warren and Stellantis in Detroit  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Thousands of Michigan autoworkers lost their jobs  And when it came to building the cars of the future  Donald Trump sat on the sidelines and let China dominate  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And then he talked down to American workers  saying we can t compete with Chinese workers  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And make no mistake  Donald Trump is no friend of labor  He encouraged automakers to move their plants out of Michigan so they could pay their workers less  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And when the UAW went on strike to demand higher wages that they deserved  Donald Trump went to a nonunion shop   don t forget   and he attacked the UAW  And he said striking and collective bargaining don t make  quote   a damn bit of difference   AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Remember how he s talked about striking workers  that you should fire them  That s how he talks about union labor  That s how he talks about workers  But  Flint  we know   we know  Strong unions mean higher wages  better health care  and greater dignity    applause    for union members and for everyone   Applause   And on top of all of that  Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion tax cut that mostly went to the wealthy and big corporations  not to working people  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And now he is making the same empty promises to the people in Michigan that he did before  But we will not be fooled  We will not be gaslighted  Donald Trump s track record is a disaster for working people   Applause   And if he wins again  it will be more of the same  Check this out  Two days ago  his running mate   maybe you saw that  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  No  but   how about that Tim Walz  by the way   Applause    Laughs   That s right  That s right  So  two days ago  Donald Trump s running mate suggested that if Trump wins  he might let the Grand River assembly plant in Lansing close down   AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT    the same plant that our administration helped save earlier this year  along with 650 union jobs   Applause   Michigan  we together fought hard for those jobs  And you deserve a president who won t put them at risk   Applause   And for anybody watching  you know  if you want to learn more about Donald Trump s plans  just google Project 2025  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president  Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts  attack unions  cut Social Security and Medicare  and impose a Trump sales tax   a 20 percent tax on everyday basic necessities  which will cost the average pam    family nearly $4 000 a year  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And on top of this  Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act   AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT    even after he tried to repeal it time and time again when he was president and still has no plan to replace it  AUDIENCE MEMBERS  Concepts of a plan  THE VICE PRESIDENT  You watched the debate  You watched the debate  You saw that   Laughs    Applause   He said   AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  He said he  quote  has  concepts of a plan    concepts  Now  you know  I have said that I do believe he is an unserious man  And the consequences   and the consequences of him being president again are absolutely  critically serious  Because  think about it  Even on health care  he has a concept of a plan  So  he s going to threaten the health insurance of 45 million people in our country based on a concept  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  To take us back   do you remember that    when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions  Remember what that was like  Well  Michigan  we are not   AUDIENCE  Going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT    going back  We are not going back   Applause   We re not going back  We are not going back  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We are not going back  No  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Because we will move forward  Ours is a fight for the future   Applause   Ours is a fight for the future  and ours is a fight for freedom    applause    like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do   Applause   And these 32 days out from the election  it s important that we remind people how we got here  Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would overturn Roe v  Wade  and they did  And now more than one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban  many with no exceptions even for rape and incest  which is immoral  And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom    applause    as president of the United States  I will proudly sign it into law   Applause   Proudly  And here s what I want to say  Look  and that s not our only battle  Across our nation  we are witnessing a full on assault on other hard fought  hard fon    won freedoms and rights  like the freedom to vote    applause   the freedom to be safe from gun violence    applause   the freedom to join a union    applause   the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride    applause   and the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water   Applause   Flint   you know all too well  Flint  that clean water should be a right for everyone  not just for the people who can afford it   Applause   And as president  I will continue to work with communities like Flint to ensure you not only have clean water but the opportunity to recover economically and thrive   Applause   So  Michigan  it all comes down to this  We are all here together because we know what is at stake  and we love our country   Applause   We love our country  We love our country  AUDIENCE  USA  USA  USA  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We love our country  AUDIENCE  USA  USA  USA  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And because we love our country  we know it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America  That s what this is about   Applause   That s what this is about  So  Election Day is in 32 days   Applause   And already nearly 2 million ballots are in the hands of Michigan voters alone   Applause   So  if you have received your ballot  please do not wait  Fill it out and return it today  Early voting starts statewide on October 26th  and now is the time to make your plan to vote  because  folks  the election is here  The election is here   Applause   And we need to energize  organize  and mobilize   Applause   And remember  Your vote is your voice  and your voice is your power   Applause   So  Flint  today I ask  Are you ready to make your voices heard   Applause   Do we believe in freedom   Applause   Do we believe in opportunity   Applause   Do we believe in the promise of America   Applause   And are we ready to fight for it   Applause   And when we fight   AUDIENCE  We win  THE VICE PRESIDENT    we win  God bless you  And God bless the United States of America

Thank you  Liz  THE VICE PRESIDENT  It is so good to be back in Wisconsin   Applause   I thank you  everyone  for being   please have a seat  I thank you all for being here  But I just   I have to emphasize that every time I come here and   and  Liz  I was actually a kid here  too  when my parents were at the University of Wisconsin   Laughs   So  we have that in common as well  In fact  Tony Evers always says when I land   Welcome home    Laughter   But I   I say all that to say every time that I ve come here recently  one of the conversations that we have  all of us together  is how much we love our country and that that really is the binding factor in us all being together and taking the time to be together  to really just renew and remind everyone of what is at stake  but borne out of love that we have this fight   Applause   And I want to thank you  Liz Cheney  for reminding us that that  regardless of party affiliation  is a factor that binds us all  And so  I thank you for

 Applause   Thank you  Sheriff Michek  for your support and your life of service to the people of Iowa County   Applause   And so  I   I do want to say a bit more about Liz Cheney  You all know her leadership  and she has obviously  and so importantly  been a leader for the people of Wyoming  but she has also been an extraordinary national leader and has served with great honor   Applause   And she not only  as she has talked today  recognizes that character is among the most important attributes of leadership  but she also personifies that attribute  And she possesses some of the qualities of character that I most respect in any individual and any leader  courage  especially at a moment like this  where there are so many powerful forces that have been intent on trying to demean and belittle and make people afraid  And there are many who know it is wrong  and then there are those who have the courage to speak out loudly about it and the conviction to speak truth  And  you know  it is so admirable when anyone does it  and especially when it is difficult to do in an environment such as this  But Liz Cheney really is a leader who puts country above party and above self  a true patriot    applause    and it is my profound honor   my profound honor to have your support   Applause   And I also want to thank your father  Vice President Dick Cheney  for his support and    applause    and what he has done to serve our country  Every endorsement matters  and this endorsement matters a great deal  Liz  And it carries the spicals   special significance  because  as you said  we may not see eye to eye on every issue  and we are going to get back to a healthy two party system   I am sure of that   where we will have vigorous debates   Applause   And as you said  you may not have   have supported a Democrat for president before  but as you have also said  we both love our country  and we revere our democratic ideals  And we both also believe in the nobility of public service  and we know that our oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America is a sacred oath   an oath that must be honored and must never be violated   Applause   And your words today and the reason we are all here today  I think  really do underscore perhaps one of the most fundamental questions that is facing the American people in this election  Who will obey that oath  Who will abide by the oath to preserve  protect  and defend the Constitution of the United States of America   Applause   I have had the privilege    laughs   AUDIENCE  Kamala  Kamala  Kamala  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  And I have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution six times in my career  including as vice president  as a United States senator  and as the top law enforcement officer of the largest state in our country  Applause   Responsible for upholding and enforcing the laws of the state and the laws of the United States was the work I did  And I have never wavered in upholding that oath  and I have always executed it faithfully and without reservation   Applause   And therein lies the profound difference between Donald Trump and me  He  who violated the oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America  And make no mistake  He  who if given the chance  would violate it again  Donald Trump lost the 2020 election   Applause   And as you have heard and know  he refused to accept the will of the people and the results of an election that was free and fair  As you have heard  he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol  where they assaulted law enforcement officers  He threatened the life of his own vice president and refused to engage in the peaceful transfer of power  And let us be clear about how he intends to use power if elected again  He has called for jailing journalists  political opponents  anyone he sees and deems as being an enemy  He has pledged to destroy the independence of the Department of Justice  and he called for deploying our active duty military against our own citizens  AUDIENCE MEMBER  Kristallnacht  Weird  AUDIENCE MEMBER  He s weird  THE VICE PRESIDENT  W    I   well  I believe   AUDIENCE MEMBER  We re not going back  AUDIENCE MEMBER   Inaudible   THE VICE PRESIDENT  You and my running mate both   Laughing   Well  listen  I believe that anyone who recklessly tramples on our democratic values  as Donald Trump has  anyone who has actively and violently obstructed the will of the people and the peaceful transfer of power  as Donald Trump has  anyone who has called for  I quote   termination  of the Constitution of the United States  as Donald Trump has  must never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States   Applause   Never again  Never again   Applause   And the tragic truth   the tragic truth that we are facing in this election for president of the United States is that there is actually an honest question about whether one of the candidates will uphold the oath to the Constitution of the United States  That is the tragic truth of this election  that this is actually an honest question that we are having as Americans  And I know the vast majority of us agree that upholding the Constitution must be a basic requirement we expect of anyone seeking the highest office in the land  I know the vast majority of us  regardless of your political party  agree we must hold sacred America s fundamental principles   from the rule of law  to free and fair elections  to the peaceful transfer of power   Applause   And if you share   if you share that view  no matter your political party  there is a place for you with us and in this campaign  because those principles  I know  unite us across party lines  And in this election  I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans  My entire career    applause    my entire career  I ve only had one client  the people   Applause   And when I say that   and when I say that I mean all the people  not just those who share my party affiliation  Through all my decades in law enforcement  I never asked a victim or a witness   Are you a Republican or a Democrat   The only question I ever asked was   Are you okay   And that is the kind of president we deserve  and I pledge to you that is the kind of president I will be   Applause   Because the president of the United States must not look at our country through the narrow lens of ideology or petty partisanship or self interest  The president of the United States must not look at our country as an instrument for their own ambitions  Our nation is not some spoil to be won  The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised   the nation that inspired the world to believe in the possibilities of a representative government  And so  in the face of those who would endanger our magnificent experiment  people of every party must stand together  And let me be clear  Democracy and freedom are not only at stake here at home  they are also at stake around the world  As president of the United States  I will strengthen  not abdicate America s global leadership   Applause   Last week  I met with Ukraine s President Zelenskyy    applause    and the message I delivered was the same message I ve shared with him every time I ve seen him  I stand with Ukraine  and I always will   Applause   And I told him  as I have before  I want Ukraine to prevail  By contrast  in our debate  Donald Trump couldn t even bring himself to say he wanted Ukraine to win the war   couldn t even bring himself to say that  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  A war that Putin  a brutal dictator  launched against a free and independent people  Trump wants to force Ukraine to give up its sovereign territory  a bedrock principle upon which we stand and fight for  And you know who else wants them to give up their sovereign   AUDIENCE MEMBER  Putin  THE VICE PRESIDENT    absolutely   territory   Laughter   Putin  Putin  And that s not a plan for peace  It s a plan for surrender  Well  I believe that in the global struggle between tyranny and democracy  the president of the United States must always be on the side of freedom   Applause   So  we are gathered here today in Ripon  not far  as the congresswoman mentioned  from a small building where the Republican Party was born in 1854  Liz Cheney stands in the finest tradition of its leaders  Applause   And if   and if people across Wisconsin and our nation are willing to do what Liz is doing to stand up for the rule of law  for our democratic ideals  and the Constitution of the United States  then together  I know we can chart a new way forward not as members of any one party but as Americans  Applause   Americans who are united   united in our devotion to the country we love  I thank you all  May God bless you  And may God bless the United States of America   Applause   Thank you all  Thank you  Thank you   Applause  ","","",""

evening  Good evening   Applause    Inaudible   Thank you  Thank you  Thank you   Applause   Thank you all  Thank you  thank you   Applause   Thank you  everyone  Thank you  Thank you   Applause   And can we please hear it for Captain Quintero   Applause   Oh  thank you all  Thank you  everyone  Oh  it is so wonderful to be back in Nevada  Thank you all  Thank you   Applause   And happy Hispanic Heritage Month to everyone   Applause   Thank you  Thank you all  It s good to be back  and I want to thank everyone for all that you do  I know we have some extraordinary elected leaders here  and I want to thank them for their incredible work and friendship  It is good to be with all the leaders who are here  including Representative Susie Lee  who is here    applause   Steven Horsford    applause   Dina Titus    applause   the great General Ford    applause   Senator Catherine Cortez Masto    applause   Senator Jacky Rosen  who we re going to send back to the United States Senate   Applause   Thank you  everyone  and all the local leaders here  There are so many leaders here  It is good to be back with you   Applause   Thank you  thank you  thank you  And wait a minute  We also tonight have here some of the Vegas Raiders  who won their game tonight   Applause   Thank you  Congratulations  Oh  congratulations  You came right from the game  Congratulations  Give them an applause  right   Applause   Well done  Well done  Well done  So  in all seriousness  everyone  before I begin  I want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene  And please have a seat if you re able  I want to talk about Hurricane Helene for a moment  and I know that everyone here sends their thoughts and prayers for the folks who have been so devastated by that hurricane and the ensuing events in Florida  in Georgia  the Carolinas  and other impacted states  And we know that so many have been impacted  some have died  But I want to thank everyone for doing everything you can to think about them  Send them your thoughts  Send them your prayers  I want to thank the first responders who have done so much   Applause   And we will stand with these communities for as long as it takes to make sure that they are able to recover and rebuild  Earlier today  I received an operational briefing from FEMA Director Criswell  More than 3 300 federal personnel have been mobilized  We are deploying food  water  and generators and working to restore water and power   Applause   And the president and I have told state and local leaders we will provide whatever help they need in the days and weeks ahead  And so  I thank you all for sending your best wishes to everyone there  Thank you   Applause   So  Las Vegas  we have 37 days until the election   Applause   Thirty seven days  And we know this will be a tight race until the very end  And let s level set  We are the underdog  We are the underdog  and we have some hard work ahead  But here s the thing  We like hard work  Hard work is good work  Hard work is good work   Applause   And with your help  we will win in November   Applause   Yes  we will  Yes  we will  Yes  we will  AUDIENCE  We will win  We will win  We will win  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We will win  AUDIENCE  We will win  We will win  We will win  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We will win  AUDIENCE  We will win  We will win  We will win  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We will win  And here s why   and here s why   and here s why  Because we here know that this election is about two very different visions for our nation  And the contrast  I think  was quite clear in our debate  Did you all see the debate   Applause   You saw   you saw the debate  You saw the debate  Yeah  yeah  And in two days  I know we will cheer on Coach Walz when he debates J D  Vance   Applause   Yeah  But listen  also  their debate should not be the last word  I m trying to debate Donald Trump again and    applause    I think he should debate again  The American people have a right to hear us discuss the issues  And as you say here in Las Vegas  I m all in  I m all in    applause    even if my opponent is ready to fold  so there you go  But you will remember  in our first debate  I talked about issues like bringing down the cost of living  investing in small businesses  protecting reproductive freedom    applause    and keeping our nation secure   Applause   But from Donald Trump  well  it was the same old  tired playbook   same old  tired playbook   with no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people  Well  folks  it s time to turn the page   Applause   It s time to turn the page  America is ready to chart a new way forward    applause    ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership    applause    which is why Democrats  Republicans  and independents are supporting our campaign  because we know we need a president who works for all the American people   Applause   Enough of the division  Enough of the hate  We are all in this together   Applause   And you all know  for my entire career  I ve only had one client  the people  The people   Applause   From being a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland  I stood up for women and children against predators   Applause   As attorney general of California  I took on the big banks    applause    and delivered $20 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure   Applause   I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by for profit colleges    applause    for workers who were being cheated out of their wages   Applause   And I pledge to you  as president  I will fight for all Americans  And together  we will build a brighter future for our nation   Applause   We will build a future that includes thinking about our economy in a way that it is about lifting everyone up  We will build what I call an  opportunity economy  so that every American has an opportunity to own a home  to build wealth  to start a business   Applause   And let me tell you  I love our small businesses  of which I ve met so many right here in Vegas   Applause   You know  growing up  our mother worked very long hours  and so  my sister Maya and I would go over two doors down to Ms  Shelton s house  She   we called her our second mother  And Ms  Shelton was a small business owner  So  I know  since I was a young child  who our small businesses are  who our small business owners are  Small businesses are the backbone of America s economy   Applause   I know that  I know that  And Latina small business owners are the fastest growing segment of our economy   Applause   So  my plan is about tapping into that ambition  those aspirations  those dreams  those incredible ideas  that strong work ethic that people have  also understanding not everybody gets handed $4 million on a silver platter and files for bankruptcy six times  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  So  my plan is about saying we ve got to help entrepreneurs  startups out  and I will give a $50 000 tax deduction to help entrepreneurs start their small businesses   Applause   Because right now  that tax deduction is $5 000  Can t nobody start a small business in 2024  So  we re going   we are going to make it something what   where it is doable to lift folks up  We also need to build more housing in America   Applause   My mother saved up for years  until I was a teenager  when she was able to buy our first home  And right now  a serious housing shortage is part of what is driving up cost  So  we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes    applause    and provide first time home buyers with $25 000 down payment assistance    applause    so you can just get your foot in the door  You ll do the rest  And we must lower the cost of living  because while our economy is doing well by many measures  prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high  You know it  and I know it  So  I have a plan that includes lowering costs on everything from health care to groceries  including I will take on the corporate price gouging that we know    applause    has resulted in jacking prices up  often around tragedies and emergencies  We will give a tax cut to 100 million more Americans  including $6 000 during the first year of a child s life    applause    knowing that the vast majority of our young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well but not always the resources to do it  And that $6 000 in extending and expanding the Child Tax Credit will help buying a crib  buying a car seat  doing the things that are so critical in that first phase of life  I will also make sure good paying jobs are available to all Americans  not only those with college degrees   Applause   Because we need to recognize the value of additional paths  such as apprenticeships and technical programs   Applause   And so  as president  part of how I m going to push this forward is I will get rid of unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs    applause    understanding that having a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a worker   Applause   And when we do that with the federal workforce  I m coming to ask the private sector   challenge you to do the same   Applause   So  all of this is to say I will always put the middle class and working families first  I come from the middle class  and I will never forget where I come from   Applause   Never  Now  Donald Trump has a different plan  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  Just google  Project 2025   AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Which  I have to say  I still can t believe they put that thing in writing   Laughter   They printed it up  They bound it  They handed it out  Just google it  It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he would do if he were elected again as president  Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts again   AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT    cut Social Security and Medicare   AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT    and impose what I call a  Trump sales tax   which would be a 20 percent tax on everyday basic necessities   AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT    which economists have measured would cost the average family nearly 4 000 more dollars a year in everyday expenses  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And on top of all this  Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And he has no plan to replace it  He has  quote   concepts of a plan    Applause    Concepts   So  here s the thing  though  We can laugh about many things  but the consequences of this are quite serious   quite serious  Because think about it  He s going to threaten health coverage and health insurance for 45 million people in our country based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions  You remember what that was like  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Well  we are not going back   Applause   We are not going back  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We re not going back  We   we will move forward and    applause    and we will take on the biggest issues facing our nation  We have talked about the economy  We have talked about what we can do in terms of investing in the ambition  the aspirations of our country  We will take on the issue of immigration  We will take on a number of issues  On the subject of immigration  we must have comprehensive immigration reform    applause    with strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship    applause    including for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years  including our DREAMers    applause    including our DREAMers  And I was attorney general of a border state  I prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns  drugs  and human beings  And as president  I will double the resources for the Department of Justice to go after those transnational cartels    applause    and take action to stop the flow of fentanyl coming into our country  which is destroying entire communities   Applause   These are serious problems  and we know Donald Trump won t solve them  When he was president  he did nothing to fix our immigration system   Applause   And earlier this year  we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades  and Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought that that bill  if passed  would have hurt him  and he d prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem  That s not the kind of president we want  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  As president  he cruelly separated families and plans to do it again  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And he continues to fan the flames of fear and division  Look  we need a president who cares more about solving problems than playing political games and demeaning people full time   Applause   We re tired of that  We re   we re done with that  So  Nevada  ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom    applause    like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do   Applause   And we remember how we got here  Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court   the court of Thurgood and RBG   AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT    so that they would do as they did and overturn the protections of Roe v  Wade  And now one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban   AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT    many with no exceptions  even for rape and incest  It is immoral  Immoral  And let us agree  one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn t be telling her what to do   Applause   If she chooses  she will talk with her priest  her pastor  her rabbi  her imam  but not the government telling her what to do with her body   Applause   Come on  And with Jacky Rosen back in the United States Senate    applause    when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom  as president of the United States  I will proudly sign it into law   Applause   Proudly sign it into law  And  Nevada  you know I m traveling all over our country  Across our nation  we are witnessing a full on assault on other hard fought  hard won freedoms and rights  like the freedom to vote  the freedom to join a union  the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water  the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride    applause    and the freedom to be safe from gun violence    applause    which after 1 October Nevada proved that smart gun safety laws are just common sense   Applause   So  look  generations before us  generations of America led the fight for freedom  and the baton   well  it s now in our hands  It s now in our hands   Applause   And it all comes down to this  We are here together  You came out on a Sunday evening  We are here together because we know what is at stake  and we are here together because we love our country  We love our country  We love our country   Applause   AUDIENCE  USA  USA  USA  THE VICE PRESIDENT  That s right  That s right  AUDIENCE  USA  USA  USA  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And I do believe   I do believe that one of the highest forms of patriotism that we could show is to then fight for the ideals of our country  That s what this is about  It is a fight to realize the promise of America   Applause   And I know the people of Nevada  you are Battle Born  You are Battle Born   Applause   Yes  you are  And we are all ready for the work ahead  Thirty seven days   Applause   Thirty seven days  And here in Nevada  every voter will receive a ballot in the mail  and in person early voting starts October 19th   Applause   So  now is the time to make your plan for how you are going to vote  Okay  And I d ask you to start making your plan now for how you are going to vote  And if you choose to vote by mail  do not wait  Fill out your battl    ballot  sign it  and send it back right away   Applause   Okay  And tell your neighbors  Because  folks  the election is here    applause    and we need to energize and organize and mobilize  And remember  your vote is your voice  Your voice is your power  Don t ever let anybody take your power from you  Never   Applause   Never  Don t let anybody silence you ever  So  Las Vegas  today  I ask you  are you ready to make your voices heard   Applause   Do we believe in freedom   Applause   Do we believe in opportunity   Applause   Do we believe in the promise of America   Applause   And are we ready to fight for it   Applause   And when we fight   AUDIENCE  We win  THE VICE PRESIDENT    we win  God bless you  And God bless the United States of America  God bless you   Applause  ","","",""

Theresa and her extraordinary courage  Please  can we applaud her extraordinary courage   Applause   Thank you  Thank you  thank you  thank you  Please have a seat  everyone  Thank you  It s good to be back in Arizona   Applause   It is good to be back in Arizona  Thank you all  Thank you so very much   Applause   AUDIENCE  Kamala  Kamala  Kamala  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  AUDIENCE  Kamala  Kamala  Kamala  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Thank you  thank you  thank you  Thank you  I appreciate   thank you so very much  I   I just want to  for a moment  speak about Theresa  We   we had some time together backstage  And  you know  I think that in moments of crisis  such as the fentanyl crisis  there are people who  through their suffering and their pain  rise with courage in such a selfless way to be a voice for others with the anticipation and the hope and the hard work of hoping that their story will be the reason other people don t have that story  And you sharing your story about Jacob and your advocacy on why we have to stop this scourge is so incredibly important  And  again  I applaud Theresa  and I know we all do   Applause   And our need to stop this issue is one of the reasons that we are all here together today  I also want to thank the extraordinary elected officials who are here  Senator Mark Kelly  who came with me   Applause   He had   and his extraordinary wife  Gabby Giffords  traveled with me from Washington  D C  to be here  And Senator Kelly has been talking with me for quite some time about the importance of this visit  And so  I thank you in front of all of our friends for your work   Applause   Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Attorney General Kris Mayes  who just tore up the floor up   Applause   She is  you know  one of   well  I m going to talk a bit about it in a minute  but some of the work that   that I have done in my career as attorney general and watching her do the work that she has done as attorney general really does emphasize the importance of having the right leader at the right time in the right place  and that s who she is   Applause   Mayor Huish  I thank you for the warm welcome  We ve spent some time together  You ve shared with me the needs of your community   Applause   And I thank you for your leadership as well  And to all the elected and community leaders here today  thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon  Before I begin  I do want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene  I spoke this morning with our FEMA Administrator Criswell  and President Biden and I  of course  will continue to monitor the situation closely  We have mobilized more than 1 500 federal personnel to support those communities that have been impacted  We have food  water  and generators that are ready for deployment  and    applause    we are working to restore power for   for millions of people who currently are experiencing outages  And I just want to stress   and for the   the press that is here  to those who are watching   the storm continues to be dangerous and deadly  and lives have been lost  and the risk of flooding still remains high  So  I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment  So  thank you all  And   and now I ll speak about  in particular  the people who are here today and why we are gathered here together today  So  Arizona  I think you all know  and this is why you are here  there are consequential issues at stake in this election  and one is the security of our border  The United States is a sovereign nation  and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them  and I take that responsibility very seriously  We are also a nation of immigrants  The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story  and so we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way  that it is humane  and that it makes our country stronger   Applause   So  I ve just come from visiting the border and the port of entry in Douglas  I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and Customs officers who every day see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port  These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help keep our nation secure  and they need more resources to do their jobs  which is why we have and are in the process of investing half a billion dollars to modernize and expand the port of entry here in Douglas    applause    and why last December I helped raise the rate of overtime pay for border agents    applause    and also why I strongly supported the comprehensive border security bill written last year   written last year  as you know  by a bipartisan group of senators  including one of the most conservative members of the United States Congress  That bill would have hired 1 500 more border agents and officers  It would have paid for 100 inspection machines to detect fentanyl that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year  It would have allowed us to more quickly and effectively remove those who come here illegally  And it would have increased the number of immigration judges and asylum officers  It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades  It was endorsed by the Border Patrol union  and it should be in effect today  producing results in real time right now for our country   Applause   But Donald Trump tanked it  He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said   Stop the bill   Because  you see  he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem   Applause   And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future   Applause   And so  even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the border security bill  it is my pledge to you that as president of the United States  I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law   Applause   And let me say  the issue of border security is not a new issue to me  I was attorney general of a border state for two terms  I saw the violence and chaos that transnational criminal organizations cause and the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs  I walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United States  I ve seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room  complete with lighting and air conditioning  making very clear that it is about an enterprise that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns  drugs  and human beings  And my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns  drugs and human beings  My team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican cartels  We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa Cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the United States  We seized millions of dollars  worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cortel   Cartel and broke up a drun    a drug trafficking operation  including pill mills and so called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results  As attorney general of California  it was 10 years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American attorneys general and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet with Mexican attorneys general to address this issue and  in particular  to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity  All of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers  And I started  as attorney general  the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy  So  stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me  and it is a long standing priority of mine  I have done that work  and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected president of the United States   Applause   And it is my pledge to you  understanding how solutions get formed  that I will reach across the aisle and I will embrace commonsense approaches and new technologies to get the job done  because I know transnational gangs coming across the border  trafficking in guns  drugs  and human beings  could care less who somebody voted for in the last election   Applause   They could care less  They ve got one goal in mind  and it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would work with other leaders for commonsense solutions  understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don t work together to fix these problems  And look  I   transnational gangs  one of the things I know about them  they are always innovating  So  to disrupt them  we must do the same  and that means  again  working together in real time  grounded on finding commonsense approaches  not just about some rhetoric at a rally but actually doing the work of fixing a problem   Applause   And as president  I won t only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked  I will do more to secure our border  To reduce illegal border crossings  I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry  Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from reentering for five years  We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators  And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully  they will be barred from receiving asylum  While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States  our system must be orderly and secure  and that is my goal   Applause   And that is my goal  Securing our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities  Fentanyl is a scourge on our country  The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal  so much so that using it one time only can be fatal  I have met far too many families  parents  loved ones who have lost a family member  a child to fentanyl  and their grief is heartbreaking  And the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities  It s impacting communities across our country  regardless of where they are geographically  politically  or any other demographic you cl    you choose to talk about  It s a scourge in our country  and we have to take it seriously  And as president  I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States   Applause   And I know everyone here understands that most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico  Most often  they are smuggling it through vehicles at legal ports of entry  like the one I visited today  The fact is  border officers don t have enough resources and are only able to search a fraction of the vehicles that pass through their checkpoints  This is unacceptable  They need the resources to do their jobs  And as we could have done with that border security bill  I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines   more personnel  more training  and more technology  including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles  And we will make sure that our ports of entry  including airports and seaports  have additional state of the art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it  I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels   Applause   Yes  I will ensure that we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain  because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country  My approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl are by and large made in China and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here into the United States  Our administration demanded that China crack down on the companies that make those chemicals  and it has started to happen  but they need to do more  And as president  I will hold them to their commitment to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals coming from China   Applause   Yeah  And all of this to say  we must tackle this issue from every angle  because our highest charge must be to protect the lives of our people  It must be to understand the pain and to have the courage to know that the solutions are at hand if we focus on fixing a problem instead of running on a problem   Applause   And on this issue  writ large  we must ensure that our country remains strong and competitive  which includes fixing our broken immigration system   Applause   And let me be clear  I reject the false choice   I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe  orderly  and humane  We can and we must do both   Applause   We must do both  And we need clear  legal pathways for people seeking to come into our country    applause    and we must make our current system work better  For example  it can take years for asylum claims to be decided  Well  this is a problem we can solve  including by hiring more asylum officers and expanding processing centers in people s home countries   Applause   And as president  I will work with Congress to create  at long last  a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years    applause    for years and deserve to have a system that works  I also have in mind our DREAMers  I have met    applause    I have met with so many of our DREAMers throughout my career  They who have grown up in the United States  were educated here  pay taxes here  serve in our military  and contribute to our communities every day  They are American in every way  but still  they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship  And this problem has gone unsolved  at this point now  for decades  The same goes for farm workers who ensure that we have food on our tables    applause    and who sustain our agricultural industry  and they  too  have been in legal limbo for years because politicians have refused to come together to fix our broken immigration system  Well  as president  I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions   solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long   Applause   For far too long  we have all known this is not working as it can and as it should  And so  as I said at the beginning  these issues are highly consequential for our nation  and the contrast in this election is clear  It is a choice between commonsense solutions and the same old political games  In the four years that Donald Trump was president  he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system  He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges  He did not solve the shortage of border agents  He did not create lawful pathways into our nation  He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system and did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge   Applause   As overdoses went up during his presidency  he fought to slash funding for the fight against fentanyl  And what did he do instead  Well  let s talk about that  He separated families  He ripped toddlers out of their mother s arms  put children in cages  and tried to end protections for DREAMers  He made the challenges at the border worse  And he is still   and he is still fanning the flames of fear and division  And let me be clear  that is not the work of a leader  That is not the work of a leader  and that is  in fact  I think we all believe  an abdication of leadership   Applause   And so  on behalf of all across our nation who want to see these problems solved  I say we cannot accept Donald Trump s failure to lead  We should not permit scapegoating instead of solutions  And let s see what s happening  Let s not permit scapegoating instead of solutions or rhetoric instead of results  As your president  I will protect our nation s sovereignty  secure our border  and work to fix our broken   broken system of immigration  and I will partner with Democrats  Republicans and independents to do it   Applause   Arizona  it is time for us to turn the page on the ugly battles that have characterized our politics  and it is time to move forward together to achieve real solutions that make our country stronger  And I know we can get this done  I know we have the will  I know we have the courage  I know the solutions are at hand  and I know we are ready   Applause   And so  with all of that  I say  thank you  May God bless you  And may God bless the United States of America   Applause   Thank you all

Thank you all  Thank you  Thank you   Applause   Okay  We have work to do  We have work to do   Laughs   Please have a seat  everyone  Oh  it s so good to see so many friends  Thank you all  and thank you for all you have done to be so supportive   Applause   Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  And thank you for all that you have done and for taking the time to be here on this Sunday afternoon  It means so much  And we have a lot of work to do  but there s a lot of work that s already happened thanks to all of you  So  thank you  thank you  thank you   Applause   Thank you  thank you  And this is a room full of incredible leaders  including  of course  our governor of New York  Kathy Hochul    applause   Leader Schumer  who has been an extraordinary partner to the president and me    applause   members of Congress  including Representative Goldman   Applause   And to all the dear friends and long standing partners here today  I thank you  I thank you  All right  Let s level set  Everybody get   just get comfortable   Laughs   Let s level set  We have 44 days   44 days  And every four years   because a lot of us have been in rooms like this every four years  if not more frequently   and we say  every four years   This is the one   Well  this here is the one  This is the one   Applause   This is the one  This is probably the most important election of our lifetime and probably one of the most important in the lifetime of our nation  And this election really is about two very different visions for our nation  a contrast that I think became very clear in the recent debate   Applause   And  by the way  I think we should have another debate   Applause   I just accepted an invitation to debate in October  which my opponent seems to be looking for an excuse to avoid  But he should accept  In all seriousness  he should accept  because I feel very strongly that we owe it to the American people and to the voters to meet once more before Election Day and continue the conversation from that first debate   Applause   And in that debate  you ll remember  I talked about my plans to bring down the cost of living  to invest in America s small businesses  to protect reproductive freedom  and keep our nation safe   Applause   But that s not what we heard from Donald Trump  Instead  it was the same old show  the same old  tired playbook that we ve heard for years  with no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people  Well  it s time to turn the page   Applause   It s time to turn the page  And America is ready to chart a new way forward  ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic   optimistic about what we can do together   Applause   And I do believe that is why Democrats and Republicans and independents are supporting our campaign  because they want a president who works for all the American people  and that is the kind of president I pledge to you that I will be  I have  my entire career  fought for the people  As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland  California  I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them  As attorney general of California  I defended communities that were being poisoned by polluters and Big Oil  I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for profit colleges  for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due  for seniors facing elder abuse  And as president  I will fight on behalf of all Americans  And I know that  together  we can and we must build a brighter future for our nation  a future where we build what I called an  opportunity economy    an economy where everyone can compete and everyone has a real chance to succeed  where middle class families have security and stability  and all Americans  regardless of who they are or where they start  can build wealth for themselves and their children  To build that opportunity economy  I will bring together labor  small business  founders  and innovators in major companies  We will partner together to invest in America s competitiveness  to invest in America s future  We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors  We will create a stable business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road  We will invest in semiconductors  clean energy  and other industries of the future  And we will cut needless bureaucracy and unnecessary red tape  all of which will create jobs  drive broad based economic growth  and cement America s leadership throughout the world   Applause   The way I see it  this is motivated and designed in large part knowing that the vast majority of Americans don t want to just be able to get by  They want to get ahead  They want to get ahead  They want to be able to own a home  build wealth  start a business  And so  I ll tell you a little bit more about some specific plans I have   and  again  in contrast to my opponent  who offers very little   Laughter   So  for example  I ll tell you I love our small businesses  I love small businesses   Applause   I really do  And maybe it s because  growing up   and my sister Maya is here    applause    you know  when we were growing up   she s somewhere  usually in the back of the room  There she is  Well  when we were growing up  we lived in an apartment above a childcare center  and that childcare center was owned by Mrs  Shelton  who lived two doors down from us  And Mrs  Shelton helped my mother raise us  When my mother worked long days and worked on the weekends  Mrs  Shelton helped raise us to the point that Maya and I have always called Mrs  Shelton our  second mother   Well  Mrs  Shelton was a small business owner  and I will tell you that I learned from childhood the character of a small business owner  She was a matriarch of the community  She mentored  She hired locally  She was part of the civic fabric  And in addition  then  to being a business leader  she was a civic leader  And when I travel our country   and I have been traveling our country a lot recently  but   but for the last four years  I meet our small business owners  and they are literally   and I think we would all know this   small businesses are the backbone of America s economy  They really are   Applause   So  my plan includes giving a $50 000 tax deduction to start up small businesses   Applause   Because here s the deal  Right now  the tax deduction for start ups is $5 000  Nobody can start a small business on that  If we really mean that we want to fuel the innovation  if we want to reward the ambition  we got to do better  We also need to build more housing in America   Applause   And so  when I referred earlier to part of how I think about things  it includes cutting the red tape  And on the issue of building more housing  working with the private sector so that  by the end of my first term  we can build 3 million new homes   Applause   Part of my plan includes lowering the cost of living for America s middle class families  Because look  I grew up a middle class kid  and I will never forget where I came from  And I have a plan  then  to bring down costs on everything from health care to groceries  because it s a real impediment to people s ability to get ahead  and we ve got to bring down those costs  Under my plan  more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut  including $6 000 during the first year of a child s life   Applause   Because  look  new parents  wherever they are  whoever they are  have a natural desire to parent their children well but not always the resources that are necessary to do that  And it is in our collective benefit to be able to help them  especially when you re talking about such a fundamental phase of their child s development  So  that $6 000  that s going to include giving them support to buy a car seat  to buy a crib  to just take care of those basic necessities at a critical time  All of that to say  Donald Trump has a very different plan based on a very different vision of who we are and the needs of the American people  And I ve said this before  and I ll say it again  In many ways  Donald Trump is an unserious man  but the consequences of putting him back in the White House are extremely serious   extremely serious   Applause   Look  for example  at Project 2025  And  you know  honestly  I just have to keep saying this  I can t believe they put that thing in writing   Laughter   I mean  they didn t just put it in writing  They   they bound it and   and handed it out  And  you know  if you can t sleep one night  google it  Because   because here s the thing  It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if elected president again  He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare  to repeal our climate investments and send thousands of good paying clean energy jobs overseas  and he wants to impose what I call a  Trump sales tax   a 20 percent tax on everyday basic necessities  which will cost the average American family an additional $4 000 a year  And top economists have reviewed our plans  Goldman Sachs says my plan would grow our economy and that his plan would shrink it  Sixteen Nobel Prize winning economists have said he would reignite inflation  Moody s assessed he would ignite a recession by the middle of next year  On top of all of this  Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act  And as he said in the debate  he has   I m going to quote now    laughter     concepts of a plan    Laughter and applause    Concepts  to replace it  In all seriousness  think about this  So  he s going to threaten the health insurance of 45 million people based on a concept  Serious consequences we re talking about  And if he were to do that  it would take us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions  Remember what that was like   for so many people in our country what that meant  not having access to the health care they need  So  I will say  then  what I say everywhere I go and when I m in those rooms   those very big rooms with a lot of people   yeah    laughter and applause   I couldn t help myself  But what I say there and   and folks will repeat  We are not going back   Applause   We are not going back  We are not going back  Because  as much of anything  our fight is a fight for the future  Our fight is a fight for the future  I was saying to some folks I was talking with earlier  We re not fighting against something  we re fighting for something  And ours is a fight for the future   Applause   And ours is a fight for freedom    applause    because you all know   and as I travel the country it becomes increasingly clear to me   there is a full on attack afoot against hard fought  hard won  fundamental freedoms and rights  like the freedom to vote  The   in Georgia   right    passed a law that basically makes it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote  Think about that  The hypocrisy abounds  Whatever happened to  love thy neighbor   Attacks on the freedom to be safe from gun violence  the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water  the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride   Applause   And on that point  y    many will remember  I was one of the first electeds in the country   it was Valentine s weekend of 2004   to perform same sex marriages  Twenty    applause   So  this last February  we just celebrated the 20th anniversary of that  But think about this  Think about this  It pains my heart when I think about that and think about something like in Florida and a  Don t Say Gay  law and what that means  because  if you think about it  among the people directly impacted are teachers  And think about that young teacher who is probably in their 20s who is afraid to put up a photograph of themselves and their partner for fear they could be fired  For doing what job  God s work   teaching other people s children  So  this is real  what we re looking at  in terms of these attacks on fundamental freedoms and rights  And  of course  front of mind for so many is the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do   Applause   And on that point  let s always remember and remind folks of how we got here  Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court   the court of Thurgood and RBG   with the intention that they would overturn the protections of Roe v  Wade  and they did as he intended  And now more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban  many with no exceptions even for rape and incest  which is immoral   Applause   It is immoral to tell a survivor of a crime of violence to their body  of violation of their body  that they don t have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next  It s immoral  And as I travel the country  most people agree  One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body   Applause   Not the government  Elections matter  Elections matter  And I ll tell you  when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom  as president of the United States  I will proudly sign it into law   Applause   Proudly sign it into law  So  so much is at stake and on the line in this election  And this is not 2016 or 2020  It s not  16 or  20  because   for many reasons  including what happened a couple of months ago when the Supreme Court   the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president that he is effectively immune for whatever he does when he s in the White House  Now  think about that  So  at least before that ruling  there was the appearance or the threat of consequence  but now there is essentially explicit authority to do whatever he wants  And let s put this ruling  then   this decision in context  This is a man who has vowed that he will be a dictator on day one  He has said he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies  He has called for  and I m going to quote  the  termination  of the Constitution of the United States  So  just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails  So  all this to say  Forty four days  And we re all here together  and you all have taken the time out of your busy lives  because we know what is at stake  And we are all here together because we love our country   Applause   We love our country  We love our country  And I do believe that it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight for us to realize the promise of America  So  44 days  And early voting has already started in some states  So  essentially  the election is here  right  And this race   and I cannot emphasize this enough   this race is as close as it could be  It s as close as it could be  This is a margin of error race  I know we ve got a lot of enthusiasm and excitement about all that is possible  This is a margin of error race  And I m running   and we are running   as the underdog in this race  Our campaign is doing the work we need to do on the airwaves  on voter education in every county of every battleground state  And we are leading in many ways in terms of what we are committed to doing to build up that grassroots and community based leadership  And in the process of all of that  we are leaving it all on the field  And your support  as you know  which is why you ve been so generous   your support is absolutely critical to the work we have in front of us  The leaders in this room have done so much already  and I m going to ask for a bit more   Laughter   So  here s what I m asking for  The leaders here are part of large networks  Everyone here is part of many large networks in which you are an opinion leader  I need you to activate those networks   to tell your friends  your colleagues  your neighbors about the stakes  Tell them how close this race is  and let them know why you support our campaign  And let them know we need their help also in the next 44 days  And we need their help to please join our team in battleground states and help folks register to vote and get them to the polls  to sign up to make phone calls  to do that kind of work that really is so fundamentally important that s about that human interaction that I think so many people are really craving to remind us that we re all in this together  And I ll say this  In this campaign  let s also be intentional about building community and building coalitions and bringing folks together  because I do believe that the work we are doing right now   yes  our first imperative is to win  but it is also to build   to build community and coalitions and to remind people that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us  I think there s a hunger for that right now in our country   Applause   So  all that to say  This is a fight for our freedom and our future  and the baton is in our hands  It s in our hands   Applause   And so  I ll end by saying what I say at every rally  When we fight   AUDIENCE  We win  THE VICE PRESIDENT    we win  God bless you  God bless the United States of America   Applause   Thank you  all  Thank you  all  Thank you   Applause

 Thank you   Laughter   I just   I want to say about Dr  Reddick   you know  I   some of you may have seen I did a   an event last night with Oprah Winfrey and    applause    and that   it highlighted so many tragic stories  but it also highlighted so many important issues  which is why everyone has taken time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon  And it highlighted the importance of a Dr  Reddick  AUDIENCE  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Because the courage  Dr  Reddick  that you are showing in the face of these arcane and immoral laws  to stand so publicly and talk about your commitment to your oath and to the health and well being of people who need to be seen and treated with dignity is so extraordinary  And I do believe  in moments of crisis  the world has a way of revealing the heroes among us   Applause   And I would say  Dr  Reddick  you are one of them  Thank you very much  Thank you   Applause   Thank you  thank you  thank you  And thank you to all of the elected and community leaders who have joined us today   Applause   Thank you  thank you  everybody   everybody who is here  So  Georgia  the    this election right here is a fight for the future   Applause   AUDIENCE  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  It is a fight for the future  and it is a fight for freedom   for freedom  And we know  in America  freedom is not to be given  It is not to be bestowed  It is ours by right   Applause   It is ours by right  and that includes the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do   Applause   Yes  we must trust women  And we all know how we got here  When Donald Trump was president  he hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court   the court of Thurgood and RBG   with the intention that they would overturn the protections of Roe v  Wade  And as he intended  they did  And now more than 20 states have Trump abortion bans   extremists that have passed laws that criminalize health care providers  doctors and nurses  and punish women  In two states of those states  they provide for prison for life   prison for life for health care providers for simply providing reproductive care  the care they so earnestly and rightly believe must be delivered  All Trump abortion bans  And think about this  Many of these bans make no exception even for rape and incest  Now  many of you know I started my career as a prosecutor specializing in crimes of violence against women and children  What many of you may not know is why  So  when I was in high school  my best friend  I learned  was being molested by her stepfather  And I said to her   Look  you ve got to come and stay with us   I called my mother  She said   Of course she does   And she came and she stayed with us  And so  I made the decision early in my life that I wanted to do the work that was about protecting the most vulnerable among us and doing the work that was about giving them dignity in the process  AUDIENCE MEMBER  Thank you  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And so   well  thank everybody here for being here  standing in solidarity around the importance of that   Applause   And so  I say to you  then  from that experience and from the work that I ve done  the idea that someone who survives a crime of violence to their body   a violation of their body   would not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next  that s immoral  That s immoral  And let us agree  and I know we do  One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do   Applause   If she chooses   if she chooses  she will talk with her pastor  her priest  her rabbi  her imam  But it should not be the government or Donald Trump telling her what to do with her body   Applause   And think about it   the stories that Dr  Reddick shares with us  the stories we heard last night  the stories we ve been hearing for two years  One in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban  This includes Georgia and every state in the South except Virginia  Think about that when you also combine that with what we know has been long standing neglect around an issue like maternal mortality  Think about that when you compound that with what has been long standing neglect of women in communities with a lack of the adequate resources they need for health care   prenatal  during their pregnancy  postpartum  Think about that  And these hypocrites want to start talking about  this is in the best interest of women and children    Applause   Well  where you been  Where you been    applause    when it comes to taking care of the women and children of America  Where you been  How dare they  How dare they  Come on  And   and we understand the impact of these bans and the horrific reality that women and families   their husbands  their partners  their parents  their children are facing as a consequence every single day  Since Roe was overturned  I have met women who were refused care during a miscarriage   wanted to have a child  suffering a miscarriage  I met a woma    a woman   I ve actually met several who were turned away from the emergency room  One  at early stages after the Dobbs decision came down  told me with tears   she was with her husband   about how only when she developed ses    sepsis did she receive emergency care  Only when she developed sepsis did she receive emergency care  And now we know that at least two women   and those are only the stories we know   here in the state of Georgia died   died because of a Trump abortion ban  One   and we heard about her story last night   a vibrant  28 year old young woman  She was ambitious  You know  we   I talked with her mother and her sisters about her  and they described such an extraordinary life of a person  She was excited  She was working hard  She was a medical assistant  She was going to nursing school  raising her six year old son  She was really proud that she had finally worked so hard that she gained the independence  Her family was telling me that she was able to get an apartment in a gated community with a pool for her son to play in  She was so proud  and she was headed to nursing school  And her name   and we will speak her name   AUDIENCE  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Amber Nicole Thurman  AUDIENCE  Amber Nicole Thurman  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Amber Nicole Thurman  AUDIENCE  Amber Nicole Thurman  THE VICE PRESIDENT  That s right  And she had her future all planned out  and it was her plan  You know  let s understand   just take pause on that for a moment  She had her plan  what she wanted to do for her son  for herself  for their future  And so  when she discovered that she was pregnant  she decided she wanted to have an abortion  but because of the Trump abortion ban here in Georgia  she was forced to travel out of state to receive the health care that she needed  But when she returned to Georgia  she needed additional care  so she went to a hospital  But  you see  under the Trump abortion ban  her doctors could have faced up to a decade in prison for providing Amber the care she needed  Understand what a law like this means  Doctors have to wait until the patient is at death s door before they take action  You know  on the other side of my   you know  the   the other folks  th    Trump and his running mate  and they ll talk about   deepens voice   Oh  well  yeah  but I   you know  I   I do believe in the exception to save the mother s life    Laughter   Okay  All right  Let s break that down  Shall we  AUDIENCE  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Let s break that down   Applause   Let s break that down  So  we re saying that we re going to create public policy that says that a doctor  a health care provider  will only kick in to give the care that somebody needs if they re about to die  Think about what we are saying right now  You re saying that good policy  logical policy  moral policy  humane policy  is about saying that a health care provider will only start providing that care when you re about to die  And so  Amber waited 20 hours   20 hours  excruciating hours   until finally she was in enough physical distress that her doctors thought they would be okay to treat her  But it was too late  She died of sepsis  And her last words to her mother   which her mother  as you know  tears up and cries every time she speaks it   last words to her mother   Promise me you ll take care of my son   So  I met last night and I spent time with Amber s mother and her sisters  and they spoke about Amber   a daughter  a sister  a mother   with the deep love that you can imagine and how terribly they miss her  And their pain is heartbreaking  It s heartbreaking  Amber s mother  Shanette  told me that the word  preventable  is over and over again in her head when she learned about how her child died   the word  preventable   She cannot   she can t stop thinking about the word that they spoke to her  It was  preventable   Because  you see  medical experts have now determined that Amber s death was preventable  And through the pain and the grief of her mother  who courageously told her story  I promised her  as she has asked  that we will make sure Amber is not just remembered as a statistic    applause    that she will not just be remembered as a statistic  so that people will know she was a mother and a daughter and a sister and that she was loved and that she should be alive today    applause    and that she should be alive today  And many of us remember   there s so many leaders here   from two years ago when the Dobbs decision came down  we knew this could happen  There is a word  preventable   and there is another word  predictable  AUDIENCE  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And the reality is for every story we hear of the suffering under Trump abortion bans  there are so many other stories we re not hearing but where suffering is happening every day in our country  an untold number of people suffering  Women who are also being made to feel as though they did something wrong  The judgment factor here is outrageous   being made as though to feel as though they are criminals  as though they are alone  So  to those women  to those families  I say on behalf of what I believe we all say  We see you  and you are not alone  and we are all here standing with you   Applause   Standing with you  You are not alone  You are not alone   Applause   So  Georgia   AUDIENCE MEMBER  We will not be silent  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We   and we will not be silent  AUDIENCE  We will not be silent  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And we will not be silent  But this is a health care crisis  AUDIENCE  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  This is a health care crisis  and Donald Trump is the architect of this crisis  He brags about overturning Roe v  Wade  In his own words  quote   I did it  and I m proud to have done it   he says  He is proud  Proud that women are dying  Proud that doctors and nurses could be thrown in prison for administering care  Proud that young women today have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers  How dare he  How dare he  And in our debate last week    laughter and applause   Well  that was fun   Laughs   But   and I know everyone here paid attention to the words  though   the words  right  AUDIENCE MEMBER   Inaudible   THE VICE PRESIDENT   Laughs   I m trying to get another debate  We ll see   Laughter   But in our debate last week  remember when he said  Everyone wanted Roe v  Wade to be overturned  AUDIENCE MEMBER  I don t know where  everyone  is  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Well  exactly  I don t know where everyone is either  because    laughter and applause    women have been arrested and charged for miscarriages  They didn t want that  AUDIENCE  No  THE VICE PRESIDENT  I   I was speaking with a physician who is here  who has  in her professional experience  been administering care to girls  And what we know is that 12  and 13 year old survivors of assault are being forced to carry a pregnancy to term  They didn t want this  AUDIENCE  No  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And couples just trying to grow their family being cut off in the middle of IVF treatments  they didn t want this  AUDIENCE  No  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And on that last point  you probably saw  this week  for the second time  Republicans in the United States Senate blocked a bill that would protect access to IVF treatment  Now  consider among the multitude of ironies the fact that  on the one hand  these extremists want to tell women they don t have the freedom to end an unwanted pregnancy  and on the other hand  these extremists are telling women and their partners they don t have the freedom to start a family  Okay  And they want to restrict access to contraception as well  And now Donald Trump says that he would personally cast his vote in Florida  which is where he now lives  to support their extreme abortion ban  just like the one that is here in Georgia  And   AUDIENCE MEMBER  Felons can t vote   Laughter and applause   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Well  that s a whole different policy discussion that we ll have for another day   Laughter   But let s understand  if he is   if he is elected again as president  Donald Trump will go further   Applause   But we know what we re up against  and we must   we must speak of the stakes  We must remind   everybody here knows  but we got to remind our friends  our neighbors  our coworkers  The stakes are so high  Because  if he is elected again  I am certain he will sign a national abortion ban  which would outlaw abortion in every single state  And he would create a national anti abortion coordinator   look at Project 2025   and force states to report on women s miscarriages and abortions  It s right there  I can t believe they put that Project 2025 in writing   Laughter   I   I   they   they put it   they literally put it in writing  They bound it   Laughter   They handed it out  I mean  they are simply out of their minds   Laughter and applause   And it s clear that they just don t trust women  AUDIENCE  They don t  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Well  we trust women  We trust women   Applause   And like Dr  Reddick said  when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms  as president of the United States  I will so proudly sign it back into law   Applause   I will so proudly sign it into law  Proudly sign it into law   Applause   So  46 days to go  And let us remember that momentum on this and so many issues   momentum is on our side   Applause   Let s remember  since Roe was overturned  every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot   from Kansas to California to Kentucky  in Michigan  Montana  Vermont  and Ohio   the people of America have voted for freedom   Applause   The people of America have voted for freedom   and not just by a little but by overwhelming margins  from so called red states to so called blue states  providing and making clear  also  this is not a partisan issue  This is not a partisan issue  And it is proving that the voice of the people has been heard and will be heard again   and will be heard again   Applause   So  46 days to go in probably the most consequential election of our lifetime  And with that  then  today  I ask  Georgia  are you ready to make your voices heard   Applause   Do we trust women   Applause   Do we believe in reproductive freedom   Applause   Do we believe in the promise of America   Applause   And are we ready to fight for it   Applause   And when we fight   AUDIENCE  We win  THE VICE PRESIDENT    we win   Applause   God bless you  And God bless the United States of America   Applause   Thank you  Thank you  Thank you all for being here   Applause  ","","",""

VICE PRESIDENT  I can  And I    I have to tell you  there is so much that I love about our campaign  because it really is about the people  And I look around at these screens  Oprah  I look at who s in the room  and this is America  MS  WINFREY  This is  THE VICE PRESIDENT  This is America  You know  I was saying with a group of friends earlier  I think  in this moment  where we ve dealt with so much that I think is quite exhausting around powerful forces that would try and divide us    MS  WINFREY  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT     and try us    to have us  as Americans  pointing fingers at each other    MS  WINFREY  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT     that this movement that is about reminding each other that we have so much more in common than what separates us is so critically important  and this is about the strength of who we are as Americans  And this movement that we re in about  as I like to say  seeing in the face of a stranger  a neighbor  MS  WINFREY  Yes  yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Right  MS  WINFREY  Yes  yes  yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  An extension of  love thy neighbor   that you literally  in the face of a stranger  see a neighbor    MS  WINFREY  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT     and approach each other with that level of dignity and grace and    and kindness  MS  WINFREY  Well  that s exactly what happened with    THE VICE PRESIDENT  You know  MS  WINFREY     Win With Black Women  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yes  MS  WINFREY  I know you ve known Jotaka    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Jotaka  MS  WINFREY     for many years  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Thank you  my dear  Oh  MS  WINFREY  Well  that s exactly what happened     applause     THE VICE PRESIDENT  She started it  MS  WINFREY     tha     is that they had this big call    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Jotaka started it  MS  WINFREY  They had the big call    THE VICE PRESIDENT  It s your fault   Laughs   MS  WINFREY  They had the big call and then said   Let s open the door   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  MS  WINFREY   Let s open the door and invite everybody else in   And everybody actually came  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Organically  MS  WINFREY  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Organically  MS  WINFREY  Yeah  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Like  this is the beauty of our country  I    you know  there s so much at stake in this election  and  ultimately  the question before us is  What kind of country do we want to live in  And the beauty of a democracy    as long as we can hold on to it    the beauty of a democracy is each of us has the power    MS  WINFREY  That s right  THE VICE PRESIDENT     each of us has the power    MS  WINFREY  That s right  That s right  THE VICE PRESIDENT     to answer that question  MS  WINFREY  That s right  Everybody    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Right  MS  WINFREY     on this call and beyond has the power  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  MS  WINFREY  But can I just start with this  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yes  please  MS  WINFREY  I have to say this  because in all of my private conversations    Gayle and I have said this a hundred times    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  MS  WINFREY  Ev     and everybody is saying it  You all have said it  I know you have  It seems to us that something happened to you the moment Joe Biden    President Biden stepped aside and withdrew his candidacy  that a veil or something dropped  and you just stepped into your power   Applause   I mean  literally  looking at you at a speech like the week before  which was a great speech  very nice     laughter     and then the next week    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Oprah   Laughs   MS  WINFREY     I saw you walking in the thing     Oprah struts around the stage      laughter and applause     and I said   What happened to you   THE VICE PRESIDENT  You know  we each have those moments in our lives where it s time to step up  MS  WINFREY  Time to step up  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Time to step up  you know   Applause   MS  WINFREY  Well  the moment you heard    I mean  I really have been saying to people  it felt like a veil dropped  and you sort of stepped through that veil  Did    did that actually    did you feel like that  THE VICE PRESIDENT  I felt a sense of responsibility  to be honest with you  And with that  comes a sense of purpose  But  I mean  we re all here  and you all are taking time out of your busy lives    everyone here  everyone on the screen    because there really is so much at stake  You know  I have spent the majority of my career being concerned about the well being of other people  MS  WINFREY  Yeah  THE VICE PRESIDENT  As I have said  my career as a prosecutor  I never looked at a    a victim or a witness and asked them   Are you a Republican or a Democrat   The only thing I ever asked them is   Are you okay   MS  WINFREY   Are you okay   I know  when I heard that    THE VICE PRESIDENT  You know  MS  WINFREY     it touched me  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And traveling this country and knowing what is at stake in terms of fundamental freedoms  what s at stake in terms of fighting against hate and those    those efforts to divide us  and I do know that I am in a position to do something about it  So  I felt a great responsibility and    and the incredible power of the people    right     who    and I m not the only leader in this  We re all leaders in this  This is so much bigger than me  It s about who we are as Americans  and it s about making clear what we stand for  And what we stand for is it is about the ideals upon which we were founded  including the importance of freedom and    and the importance of independence and    and the importance of dignity and    and purpose  but it is also about what we stand for in terms of our values  I    I think of it this way    MS  WINFREY  Yeah  I think a lot boils down to values  I just said  Values are    THE VICE PRESIDENT  It really does  MS  WINFREY     on the line here  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  It does  I mean  think about it  Oprah  The idea that some would suggest and that my opponent and    suggests  which is that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down    come on  The real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up  And it s    it s important for us     applause     MS  WINFREY  Absolutely  And  you know    THE VICE PRESIDENT     to articulate that  MS  WINFREY  You know  ever since the debate  we feel for our fellow citizens in Springfield  Do you not    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  MS  WINFREY     think about the fellow citizens in Springfield  Ohio  the Haitian families  the    the non Haitian families  everybody having to deal with this lie that has endangered the lives of Haitian people and anybody who looks Haitian  Everybody in America feels for that  And I    also  everybody in America    left  right  middle    has concerns about immigration  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  MS  WINFREY  And I m told that Justin    Justin  where are you in the audience  Justin    PARTICIPANT  Hello  MS  WINFREY     in our audience  PARTICIPANT  Hello  Madam Vice President  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Hi  Justin  MS  WINFREY  You live in Michigan  PARTICIPANT  Yes  ma am  MS  WINFREY  Don t you love saying   Hello  Madam Vice President    Laughter   PARTICIPANT  I do  I do  MS  WINFREY  What s    what s your question  It s an immigration question  I was told  PARTICIPANT  My question for you is  When you become president  what would be your specific steps    THE VICE PRESIDENT  With your help   Laughter   PARTICIPANT  Yeah  of course  What would be your specific steps to strengthening the border  THE VICE PRESIDENT  So  it s a wonderful and important question  I    you know my background was as a prosecutor  and I was also the elected attorney general for two terms of a border state  So  this is not a theoretical issue for me  This is something I ve actually worked on  PARTICIPANT  Okay  THE VICE PRESIDENT  I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns  drugs  and human beings  I take very seriously the importance of having a secure border and ensuring the safety of the American people  Sadly  where we are now can be traced most recently back to the fact that when the United States Congress    members of the Congress  including some of the most conservative Republicans  came up with a border security bill    and here s what that border security bill would have done  It would have put 1 500 more border agents at the border  And let me tell you  those border agents are working around the clock  It would have just been about giving them some support and relief  which is probably why the border agents actually endorsed the bill  It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl  And I m looking at people from all over the country here  so I don t need to tell the folks who are watching this what fentanyl has done to families  to    to kids in our country  and the need to take seriously stemming the flow coming into our country and addressing that extraordinary and    and tragic issue in terms of its effect  The bill would have allowed us to have more resources to prosecute transnational criminal organizations  and it would have been part of the solution  And Donald Trump called up those folks and said   Don t put that bill on the floor for a vote   He blocked the bill  And you know why  PARTICIPANT  Why  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Because he d prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem   Applause   And he has put his politil    personal political security before border security  Because understand  even in the intervening months  what that bill would have done to give support to folks who care about this issue  And this  again  gets to the point about what does leadership really look like  and is it about you or is it about the people  PARTICIPANT  Right  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Is it about running on problems or fixing problems  My work and my career has always been about saying   Let s fix problems   MS  WINFREY  So    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Let s address the needs  because we know it s within our capacity to do that  MS  WINFREY  So  to answer Justin s question  now that that bill has gone and hasn t passed  will you reintroduce that  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Absolutely  And when I am elected president of the United States  I will make sure that bill gets to my desk  and I will sign it into law   Applause   MS  WINFREY  Thank you  Justin  PARTICIPANT  Thank you  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Thank you  Justin  MS  WINFREY  Listen to this  A majority of young Americans  18 to 34  say that the cost of living is their top issue ahead of the election  Let s take a look   A video is played   Well  Rachael and Garrett are joining us on Zoom from Pennsylvania  And I understand your sister and brother in law moved in  and you re hoping to save money to have a second child  PARTICIPANT   Via teleconference   That s right  Hi  Oprah  Hi  Madam Vice President  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Hi  guys  PARTICIPANT  It s nice to be with you all  MS  WINFREY  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Hi  MS  WINFREY  And so    PARTICIPANT   Inaudible   MS  WINFREY     what did    what did you want to say to the vice president  PARTICIPANT  So  Madam Vice Predi     President  we are  like many  many young Americans  just experiencing a very high cost of living  We ended up giving up our apartment  moving in with our parents  who were so gracious to take us in for over a year so that we could save money and ultimately buy a home  because that s what we thought the American dream was  to    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yep  Yeah  PARTICIPANT     to get married and buy a home and have a baby  And now  here we are  and our mortgage is incredibly higher than what we thought it would be  And my sister and our brother in law are living with us right now so that they can hopefully one day do the same  And while it s beneficial for us because they help us pay off some of our mortgage  it s also beneficial for them because they can save on cheaper rent  But we really would love to know what your plan is to help lower the cost of living  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  I    first of all  thank you both for being here  And yours is a    a story I hear around the country as I travel  and in terms of both rightly having the right to have aspirations and dreams and ambitions for your family and working hard and finding that the American dream is  for this generation and so many recently  far more elusive than it s been  And we need to deal with that  and there are a number of ways  One is bringing down the cost of everyday necessities  including groceries  So  that s why I m taking on  for example  price gouging  which is when    you know  most companies and corporations are good  but for those bad ones  they take advantage of people  especially during a pandemic or extreme weather  and they end up jacking up prices  And there needs to be accountability and consequence for that  So  I m going to be taking on price gouging  But it s also about dealing with what we need to do around homeownership  right  So  as someone mentioned during this    this film    look  I grew up a child of a mother who worked very hard  She raised me and my sister  And she saved up  and by the time I was a teenager  she was able to buy a home  And we grew up  actually  for a long time  in an apartment on top of a childcare center that was owned by the woman we called our second mother  because she helped my mother raise us  and she was a small business owner  Ms  Shelton  So  I ll bring all this together to tell you  The way I think about it is  one  when people work hard and have a dream of buying a home  we should give you the opportunity to be able to do that  which is why part of my plan is for first time homeowners     buyers to have a $25 000 down payment assistance to buy your first home  Because people just need     applause     to be able to get their foot in the door  and then you ll do the hard work  Part of my plan is what we need to do to support small businesses  because my second mother was a small business owner  And I love our small businesses and our small business owners  They are not only business leaders  they are community leaders  They    they mentor  they hire locally  And we have so many entrepreneurs in our country who have great ideas  incredible work ethic  but not necessarily access to capital  because not everybody  like my opponent  was handed $400 million on a silver plate that he filed bankruptcy six times on   Laughter   And so  part of my plan is to give start up small businesses a $50 000 tax deduction to start up their small business  Right now  it s $5 000  Nobody can start a small business with $5 000  So  that s part of my plan  MS  WINFREY  It s    that s a teeny tiny business   Laughter   THE VICE PRESIDENT  That s    that    that s business in    MS  WINFREY  $5 000    teeny tiny business  THE VICE PRESIDENT  It s a concept of a business  Right   Laughter   MS  WINFREY  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  You know where I m going   Laughs   MS  WINFREY  That s right  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And part of    MS  WINFREY  It s still on paper with the $5 000  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Right  Right  MS  WINFREY  It s still on paper  THE VICE PRESIDENT  It just hasn t happened  But    MS  WINFREY  Right  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Part of the    to speak to you guys and your family and your dreams    is what we need to do around giving middle class families tax breaks  And so  part of my plan is also to ext     extend and expand the Child Tax Credit to $6 000  so that you can  in the first year of your child s life  have the resources to be able to buy a crib and a car seat and    and clothes for your baby  knowing that s such an extraordinarily important time in their development and you shouldn t have to worry about how you re going to take care of their basic needs  All of this and more is part of what I plan to build  and I call it an opportunity economy  And it s basically about creating opportunities  knowing so many people have the ambition  have the aspirations  are working hard  but just need opportunity to reach their goals and their dreams  MS  WINFREY  I saw you smiling with that $25 000 credit for the home  I saw that smile on your face    THE VICE PRESIDENT   Laughs   MS  WINFREY     and the $6 000  Thank you all so much  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Thank you  Thank you  guys  MS  WINFREY  I want to just introduce you to Shelby  who s also in our virtual audience   Applause   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Thank you  Thank you  MS  WINFREY  Thank you  guys  Shelby from Virginia  who s also struggling with the cost of living  Tell us your story  Shelby  Why  PARTICIPANT   Via teleconference   Hi  Hi  Madam Vice President  Hi  Oprah  I m 24 years old  I m a graduate student living with my parents  and I want to move out next year and potentially buy a home  And I m concerned about the affordability of one    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  PARTICIPANT     with the extra cost and bills that I m paying now  along with the bills and costs I will pay in the future too  And so  everything just has a cost and everything is so expensive  And so  I m worried about my capacity and how I m able to fully support myself once I do live independently  MS  WINFREY  You sound like one of my daughter girls from South Africa  Graduated    she was like   I hate adulting    Laughter    I hate adulting   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Right  MS  WINFREY   This adulting isn t going so well   Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Well  so par     first of all  congratulations on all the success you ve already achieved  And it is    your story and the story of our friends before you is really    that s the American story  right  You    you are working hard  you have goals  you have ambitions  And so  part of it is  again  the $25 000 down payment assistance  Part of it is what we need to do to also push back against a very different vision for our country  Because  look  in this election  there are two very different visions for our country  One  for me  that is focused on the future  including you  and another that is focused on the past  What Donald Trump    what my opponent plans on doing for the economy is doing what he did the last time he was president  and giving another tax break for billionaires and the biggest corporations that would add $5 trillion to our deficit  And get this  He plans on what    doing what I call a  Trump sales tax   which is  basically  he s going to put a 20 percent tax on everyday necessities that economists have estimated will cost the average American $4 000 more a year    which is why Goldman Sachs  which is why Moody s  which is why Wharton School of Business  which is why 16 Nobel laureates have collectively determined after analyzing our plans  one  mine would strengthen the economy  his would weaken it  two  that on his plan  he would actually blow up inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year  So  when you think about the cost of living  my approach is about lifting you up  His would be about actually weakening our economy  And I feel very strongly when an individual  when a small business  when a family  when the middle class is strong  America is strong  MS  WINFREY  Amen to that  Amen to that   Applause   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Right  MS  WINFREY  Thank you  Shelby  Thank you  Rachael and Garrett  So  the Harris campaign kicked off the Fighting for Reproductive Freedom bus tour to support the fundamental right for women to make decisions about our own bodies  And here is a short tape on that   A video is played   So  for the millions of you who watched the Democratic National Convention  you will remember Hadley Duvall telling her incredibly powerful story  And in case you didn t see it  here s just a brief look   A video is played   Hadley is here  THE VICE PRESIDENT  There s Hadley  MS  WINFREY  Stand up  Hadley   Applause   I have to tell you  we are all standing up because we are so impressed by your courage to stand up and share your story  Where did that come from  the strength to    to do this  Because I m sure you thought long and hard before deciding to go public with your story  PARTICIPANT  When Roe v  Wade was overturned    MS  WINFREY  Thanks  everybody  PARTICIPANT     I woke up with a harsh reality of my abuse was over but my story is not  And I just could not fathom thinking about the other Hadleys out there that don t have that choice  that don t have somebody to go to  So  being able to find courage and be the light for them  that s    that s really what I do it for  MS  WINFREY  And so  what do you want to say to other people who are voting in this election regarding what happened to you and what that means  PARTICIPANT  You can t wait until it s too late to care about reproductive health care  because then it s too late  And when it affects you  it    it hits  and it    you can t deny it  You can t look at someone with a story like mine and say it didn t happen  And there are more people like me out there  and there are going to be so many more who deserve their options  They deserve their choices  Let s get involved  We have someone who s willing to hear us at a level like never before  We have someone who wants to know what we want in this country  We have someone who wants to lift up our voice  and we need to show out and show up for her  just like she s showing out and showing up for us   Applause   MS  WINFREY  All right  Is there something wanted to say to Madam Vice President  PARTICIPANT  Madam Vice President  I just want to say thank you  Thank you for seeing us  for hearing us when the Supreme Court won t  Thank you for fighting and  you know  really showing us that life is    is not about the hard things that you go through  You don t bow down    THE VICE PRESIDENT  That s right  PARTICIPANT     even when you re the underdog    especially when you re the underdog    THE VICE PRESIDENT  That s right  PARTICIPANT     you stand up and you stand tall  And you give me so much hope and so much strength  And thank you   Applause   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Aw  Hadley  Honestly    MS  WINFREY  Thank you  Hadley  for coming all this way  I hope you continue to use your voice  I hope you continue that  This week  the case of a young woman who lost her life after the abortion ban took place in Georgia made national headlines  Amber s case came to light through the reporting of journalist Kavitha Surana with Pro     ProPublica  And so  listen to her story   A video is played   Amber s mother  Shanette  and older sisters C J  and Andrika are here  and they    are they wanted to be here tonight to speak out for the first time  Ms  Shanette  what do you want us to know about Amber s story  PARTICIPANT  Initially  I did not want the public to know my pain  I wanted to go through it in silence  but I realized that it was selfish  I want y all to know Amber was not a statistic  She was loved by a family    a strong family  and we would have done whatever to get my baby  our baby  the help that she needed  When ProPublica came to my home  I pushed them away   No  No  No   But Kavitha  she kept    she was persistent  She said it was something that you needed to know  you have to hear me  Women around the world  people around the world  need to know that this was preventable  Two years later  after speaking with my daughters    because I lost strength  I lost hope    you re looking at a mother that is broken  The worst pain ever that a mother  that a parent could ever feel    her father and myself and the family    you re looking at it  MS  WINFREY  Well  we appreciate so deeply you being here  And I    we re all watching you hear that tape and those words  We know how re traumatizing that is and the strength it takes for you to be here to tell your story  and we deeply appreciate it  And I have to ask you  as her sisters  how are you coping  And what does knowing that this could have been prevented    how does    how does that sit with you  How do you cope with that on a daily basis  PARTICIPANT  I mean  it s heartbreaking  You know  that was my baby sister  I loved my baby sister  you know  I m beyond hurt  I m disappointed  I feel guilty  I wish I could have helped her  you know  because she was suffering  And we had no idea  We trusted them to take care of her  you know  And they just let her die because    because of some stupid abortion ban  They treated her like she was just another number  They didn t care for her as if  you know  she was their daughter or their  you know  granddaughter  MS  WINFREY  Yeah  PARTICIPANT  You know  and she s not here  She ll never come back  MS  WINFREY  Yeah  Andrika  what do you want to say  PARTICIPANT  I want to say that it s    it s very disheartening that my sister was allowed to suffer for 20 hours  She suffered  There was nothing that we could do to help her  We trusted the health care professionals to do their job and save her  but they failed her  MS  WINFREY  Well  I think the most powerful thing that you ve said here  Ms  Shanette  is that your daughter is not a statistic  She had a life  She was loved by her sisters  loved by her family  loved by those who knew her  And she s not just a tis     statistic  And we are happy to speak her name tonight  In    in this room  talking about what this country needs in terms of reproductive rights and freedom  what do you want to say  Madam Vice President  THE VICE PRESIDENT  I m just so sorry  And the courage that you all have shown is extraordinary  because also you just learned about how it is that she died  And    MS  WINFREY  They just recently learned  yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  How  yeah  MS  WINFREY  Yeah  yeah  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And    and Amber s mom shared with me that the word over and over again in her mind is  preventable   MS  WINFREY  Yeah  THE VICE PRESIDENT   Preventable   That word keeps coming to her  And this story is a story that is  sadly  not the only story of what has been happening since these bans have taken place  And  you know  so the    just to step back in terms of how we got here  The former president chose three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would overdo the protections of Roe v  Wade  and they did as he intended  And in state after state  including yours  these abortion bans have been passed that criminalize health care providers  In a couple of states  prison for life  Oprah    prison for life in a couple of states for a doctor or nurse who provides health care  And so  it    it seems very apparent that    MS  WINFREY  Even when the    even when the mother s life is in danger  THE VICE PRESIDENT  But see  here s the problem with that  Here s the problem with that  So  is she on death s door before you actually decide to give her help  MS  WINFREY  Mm hmm  That s the problem   Applause   That s the problem  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Is that what we re saying  MS  WINFREY  Yeah  That you ve got to prove    THE VICE PRESIDENT  That    MS  WINFREY     you re on death s door  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Like  literally  a doctor or a nurse has to say   She might die any minute  Better give her now care  because otherwise I might go to prison for life   in some cla     cases  Think about what we re doing in terms of saying that certain people who are in these state houses    and then starting with the former president of the United States    think they re in a better position than a doctor or a nurse to determine when their patient needs medical care  This literally    and    and Amber s story highlights the fact that among everything that is wrong with these bans and what has happened in terms of the overturning of Wa     Roe v  Wade  it s a health care crisis  It s a health care crisis that affects the patient and the profession  And going back to Hadley s story    and  Hadley  you ve been so remarkable    PARTICIPANT  Thank you  THE VICE PRESIDENT     in telling your story and being so strong in the way you do it  And both of these stories    really  I mean  the courage for    out of pain  for you to tell these stories to help other people is e     is just extraordinary  It s    and  Hadley  and    and I m    you just    you ve been so remarkable  You know  I    Oprah  I don t know if you know this  but when I was in high school  I learned that my best friend was being molested by her stepfather  MS  WINFREY  Yes  Yes  We heard that story on the    at the DNC  yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  MS  WINFREY  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And    and I said to her    MS  WINFREY  And you had the courage then to go to her and say   You ve got to come     THE VICE PRESIDENT   You come     MS  WINFREY      to our house   THE VICE PRESIDENT      you have to come     yeah  And she came to stay with us  I called my mother  and she came to stay with us  And the idea that these same legislators who would be saying  you know   criminalize health care providers  are also saying that after a person s body has been violated  that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next    that s immoral  MS  WINFREY  Yeah   Applause   I think it    THE VICE PRESIDENT  That s immoral  MS  WINFREY     it s not just i","mmoral  And here s    here s what I want to say  I just don t believe that those legislators  that the government has a right to be in your womb  They have no right to be in your womb with decisions about your womb  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And one does not have to abandon their faith    MS  WINFREY  Right  THE VICE PRESIDENT     or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do   Applause   MS  WINFREY  Absolutely  Absolutely  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Right  If she chooses  she will talk with her priest  her pastor  her rabbi  or her imam  but not the government telling her what s in her be     best interest  MS  WINFREY  Well  this is a long healing process for this family  and we thank you  and we hope that by being amongst people who heard you and heard your daughter s story will be meaningful to you in this journey to healing  Thank you so much for being here  Okay  I want to also     applause   Thank you  I want to hear from Star Walker  who is a campaign engagement organizer in Milwaukee    one of my hometowns  Milwaukee  Hi  Star  What s going on in

KamalaHarris com to join this people powered movement  That way  when we look back  we won t just be remembering how we felt  we ll be remembering what we did  Thank you   Applause   MS  WINFREY  Wooo

both for the seriousness of this election but the joy with which it is being handled  It is stunning  And then  I    I also really want to remind everybody    it hasn t been mentioned    but voting up and down the ballot     applause     is incredibly important  Your freedom and your daily life are    are all the way up and down that ballot  People are policies  and we need the right people in all areas    THE VICE PRESIDENT  That s right  MS  ROSS     all    all positions  And then  I would like to say to you two women  Thank you for what you represent  because as a 52 year old childless woman  I want to say to the people who think that a woman s worth is measured in her baby count    I mean  shout out to all the amazing mothers    but the childless women have been mothering the world and elevating culture     applause     as aunties  godmothers  teachers  mentors  sisters  and friends and the list go     goes on  and you do not need to push out a baby to help push humanity forward  MS  WINFREY  Amen to that  Thank you so much  Tracee Ellis Ross   Applause   Thank you so much  So  another important issue of this election is  of course  our safety  And just two weeks ago  our country experienced yet another horrific school shooting  Watch this   A video is played   We live in a country where 383 000 children have been exposed to gun violence  Now just sit with that number for a second  It s a number until it s your child  This is not normal  y all  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  MS  WINFREY  This is not normal  and this is not right  Other people in other countries do not have this issue  We    Americans  we have to do better  We have to do better   Applause   We cannot continue to just settle for your  our thoughts and prayers   Lives are being destroyed  THE VICE PRESIDENT  That s right  MS  WINFREY  Fifteen year old Natalie Griffith and her parents  Doug and Marilda  are here  And  Natalie  we are so sorry to know that you  too  have been added to that number because you were in algebra class when you were shot twice by a 14 year old fellow student  We re so glad that you lived to tell your story  And so  how are you tonight  PARTICIPANT  Well  before that thing    the video  I was ver     I was very happy  I still am very happy to be here and to    and to tell my story and what hap     and what happened  because it was a terrible thing  and it should    and it should not have    what s it called    PARTICIPANT  Never happened  MS  WINFREY  Where were you shot  Where were you physically shot  PARTICIPANT  I was right here on my shoulder  and then around here  right    PARTICIPANT  Her wrist  PARTICIPANT     around my wrist  MS  WINFREY  I was saying that 383 000 students in our country  the United States of America  have been    been exposed to violence    that same scene that you experienced in your school  Had you all been having  you know  drills or preparation    PARTICIPANT  Yes  MS  WINFREY     for what should happen should there be a shooting  PARTICIPANT  We have    I ve had intruder drills and fire drills and stuff in my old schools  We had    we have had a fire drill at Apalachee  but it was the first two months of    of the school year  We hadn t had an    had an intruder drill yet  So  we didn t even    we weren t even completely sure where to go in the classroom  We all just    I remember being like huddled and  inaudible   MS  WINFREY  So  I was watching your mother  even just when that tape was coming on  It s still very much PTSD  very much traumatic  You re still reliving it  And how has it been for you  How did you    how were you notified that there was a shooting at the school  PARTICIPANT  I was notified by a friend  She called me  I was at work  and she called me  and she said   Do you know about the shooting   Which    with the school that she goes to  the Apalachee  I said   No  I don t   And then she said   There was a shooter at the Apalachee High School   My dr     my heart just dropped  In my heart  it just got so heavy  and I could not stop    I just like    I had to leave  I told my coworkers   I got to go  I have to leave   And my first thing I did is drop my knee on the floor and just start praying  I prayed for about 30 minutes from my    from my work on the way to the s     I didn t get to get to the school on my car  I had to leave my car at a gas station about two    maybe two and a half  three miles  and I walk on foot  And I ran because my heart was so heavy  I could not get    I couldn t get in touch with my daughter  MS  WINFREY  And I hear you have a message for people in power regarding guns now  PARTICIPANT  I do  I want to finish that story  because no parent should go through this  I want to just finish what    MS  WINFREY  Yes  go ahead  PARTICIPANT     you know  the whole    the experience    you do not know what feels until it s you  MS  WINFREY  Yes  PARTICIPANT  You know  all those numbers that you show on the TV    MS  WINFREY  Yes  PARTICIPANT     you know  a lot of people that are here are mothers  You know  what are we doing about this  What are we doing  Let s make sure that everybody listens  Let s make sure that everybody hears it  The whole world needs to hear that we women that have our children  we have a job  That job is to protect our children  That job is to protect our nation  That job is to protect our country   Applause   We cannot let    we cannot leave    we cannot let that go on  We have to stop it  You know  where    I was asking earlier  where are those people  inaudible  the shooting  Where are they  They needed to make a noise  I m ready to make a noise about this  and I m ready to stop it  Because no one    no one knows what feels when you can t find your child  When you call her and you call her and she s not answering  When I went through it  you know  it s just me that knows it  And I m sure    I m so sorry for those that lost    their    their children actually died  I can actually hug my child  My child is here  And I gave all these praise to my    the Lord  our Father in Heaven saved my child  You know  but the other two mothers there lost their kids  and there are the teachers that died  You know  those people are suffering like I m suffering  I m very sorry for them  I m very sorry that they lost the pe     their loved ones  MS  WINFREY  And you have a message for the people in power  PARTICIPANT  Yes  the people in power  Let s make it a change  Let s make happen  Let s make    you know  let s just not hear about this  Who wants to just hear about this   Applause   We got to change it  We got to make it happen  You know  MS  WINFREY  And  Doug    Doug  I hear you re not a registered Democrat  but you now say it doesn t matter what side of the aisle you re on when it comes to this issue  What change do you want to see now that it has affected your family  PARTICIPANT  You know  common sense  You know  I think a first step would just be metal detectors in schools    you know  make a budget  make a plan  And    and the people that say   Well  we ve never really done stuff like that before   I don t care  You know  they didn t have metal detectors at airports at one time  You know  they didn t have metal detectors at courthouses  They    you know  I think that if a child knew that he would    would get caught that the likelihood of him trying would be    they may    there may be another target  but it wouldn t be us having to worry about schools being hardened  Or  you know    MS  WINFREY  Yeah  Yeah  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  I mean  I think that Doug has said it so eloquently  which is  we just need to apply common sense  And  look  I think for far too long on the issue of gun violence  some people have been pushing a really false choice to suggest you re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone s guns away  I m in favor of the Second Amendment  and I m in favor of assault weapons bans     applause     universal background checks  red flag laws  And these are just common sense  These are just common sense  MS  WINFREY  I thought it was so powerful at the convention when you s     when    when you said you have guns    no  at the debate  At the debate when you s     THE VICE PRESIDENT  I m a gun owner  Tim Walz is a gun owner  MS  WINFREY  I did not know that   Laughter   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And if somebody breaks into my house    MS  WINFREY  And I thought that was powerful  THE VICE PRESIDENT     they re getting shot   Laughs   I m sorry  MS  WINFREY  Yes  Yes  I    I hear that  I hear that  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Probably should not have said that   Laughter   MS  WINFREY  But I    THE VICE PRESIDENT  My staff will deal with that later  MS  WINFREY  Yeah   Laughter   But you have been a gun ow     gun owner for a while  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yes  I have  MS  WINFREY  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  But    but here s    here s my point  Oprah  is that I m not trying to take everyone s guns away  I believe in the Second Amendment  But we have to agree that    look  I    I did  last fall  a    a college tour with college age young people  So  I also did trade schools  And packed audience every time in their auditorium  and I would ask   Please raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade  you had to endure an active shooter drill   Almost every hand went up  It was bone chilling  MS  WINFREY  Yeah  This is the way our kids    THE VICE PRESIDENT  It s bone chilling  MS  WINFREY     are living  Yeah  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And think about it  You know  I grew up    we had fire drills only    well  I grew up in California  we also had earthquake drills  But the fact that our children are sitting in a classroom where they should be fulfilling their God given potential and exploring the wonders of the world  and some part of their brain realizes somebody could bust through that classroom drawer    door with a    with a weapon    with an assault weapon  And    and let s all agree that the    the trauma so many children  even those who have not directly experienced the tragedy    MS  WINFREY  Just being in the environment  THE VICE PRESIDENT  I    MS  WINFREY  Just being in the environment  THE VICE PRESIDENT  I cannot tell you the number of young people who    I mean  our kids had active shooter drills    that    that they re concerned that there might be somebody who would kill them while they are at school  This is not the sign of a civil society  MS  WINFREY  It is not  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And we    it doesn t have to be this way  MS  WINFREY  It doesn t have to    THE VICE PRESIDENT  It does not have to be this way  MS  WINFREY     be this way  THE VICE PRESIDENT  But we need to have the courage to act  I mean  look  my opponent  when he was told and    and knew about a    a shooting of a young girl  you know what he said   Get over it    Get over it   No  we re not getting over it  No  And    and to the point  everyone should have a sense of collective responsibility for the children of our community    MS  WINFREY  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT     and understand their right to live and be safe  I have personally prosecuted homicide cases  I know    I ve    autopsies  I ve seen autopsies  I ve seen what these weapons do to the human body  And we ve got to agree that  in particular  when we re talking about something like an assault weapon  it s literally designed to be a tool of war  It has no place on the streets of a civil society   Applause   It s designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly  And there are things we can do  I mean  thankfully  over the last three years    MS  WINFREY  Gosh  it just seems like    THE VICE PRESIDENT     we ve done some  MS  WINFREY     common sense  It seems like    THE VICE PRESIDENT  But it is common sense  MS  WINFREY  It just seems like common sense  We would see this  We would see this  THE VICE PRESIDENT  I think so  MS  WINFREY  And I think that the majority of Americans agree with you    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  MS  WINFREY     that we do not want assault weapons in the hands of children and other people who have no business with those types of weapons   Applause   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Right  Right  MS  WINFREY  We know this is true  So  we thank you  Natalie  and your family  for being here  PARTICIPANT  Thank you for    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Thank you

actually  I think you re going to win  I m sure you re going to win  I think     applause     yeah  But what happens when you win    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  MS  STREEP     and he doesn t accept it  And you know that there s going to be this long slog of shenanigans  And I m wondering wh     how we get to that moment  how we preserve certification on January 6th  Because if it doesn t happen  it ll be maybe thrown back to the legislatures of the states  And I ve been    I ve been working with State Government Citizens  Campaign  which is SGC C America com  so    they re    they re a great    they re doing the    the unglamorous  down ballot work of promoting those    those candidates  Because we really    I m worried about it  And I wonder    I wonder if we re ready for January 7th  8th  9th  and what happens  What happens  THE VICE PRESIDENT  So  we will be ready  But just taking a step back and    and thank you  Meryl  for your    just the gift that you give  you    you are a    you    your talent and your creativity  Thank you for being here  One of the things that I have realized in the course of our campaign is that more Americans than we may realize who voted for Trump before have decided January 6th was just a bridge too far  It    when we reflect and think about what January 6th was  where the president of the United States  sitting in the Oval Office  incited a mob  a violent mob  to attack the United States Capitol  such that 140 law enforcement officers were injured    some were killed    to    to try and upend a free and fair election where the American people voted    that was a bridge too far for a lot of people  And we have sadly now seen how far he could go  And I think there is absolutely no tolerance whatsoever for the vast majority of Americans for that  And they ve seen the lies  They understand  for example  almost every court case    I think every court case where he s challenged an election he lost  I said on the debate stage  look  because he s having a very difficult time  obviously  processing the fact that 81 million people fired him   Applause   Right  But    so  there is that  that it really was a bridge too far for so many people that they are not willing to repeat  But the other piece of it is the lawyers are working  The    it s very important that we all speak to our friends and our neighbors about misinformation and help them now see how it occurs  where it is occurring  It is important that we stand up for the integrity of poll workers and people who are working on Election Day  And    and that we also    and this is critically important  that we ask people to be alert about mis  and disinformation  and we ask them   Do not be afraid to vote   Because I think there is also something quite insidious about these attacks on the electorate in these various forms that are intended to convince people that their vote won t matter  And  in that way  there s a little bit of reverse psychology going on here  and let s    let s just make sure nobody falls for it  Your vote does matter  and we cannot let anyone ever take our power from us  We can never let anybody silence us   Applause   And when we get those votes out  starting soon    early voting is already going to start this week  I think    through November 5th  And let s make sure everyone votes  And we are going to have a good Election Day  We re going to fight for the integrity of the people s voice and for our democracy  And  you know  I ll just mention  Earlier  a couple of folks talked about what this means in terms of the world  You know  Oprah  as    as vice president  I have    I ve met over 150 world leaders  presidents  prime ministers  chancellors  and kings  And the thing about representing the United States of the America is when we walk in those rooms around the world  we have historically and traditionally been able to walk in those rooms chin up  shoulders back  with the self appointed and earned authority to talk about the importance of democracies  People around the world are watching right now  Because  you see  the thing about walking into a room and being a role model is people watch what you do to see if it lines up with what you say  And  in that way  the consequences of this election are directly going to impact the American people and people around the world  That s what we re fighting for and those are the stakes  And that s why we re going to win  because we know what we re fighting for  We    because we know what we stand for   Applause   MS  WINFREY  Thank you  Meryl  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Thank you  MS  WINFREY  So    thank you  Meryl  What is on your heart to say to the American people  as we have 47 days until November 5th  What s on your heart    THE VICE PRESIDENT  We    MS  WINFREY     to say to particularly those people who are still undecided or maybe indifferent or on the fence still  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We love our country  I love our country  I know we all do  That s why everybody is here right now  We love our country  We    we take pride in the privilege of being American  And this is a moment where we can and must come together as Americans  understanding we have so much more in common than what separates us  Let s come together with the    the character that we are so proud of about who we are  which is we are an optimistic people  We are an optimistic people  Americans  by character  are people who have dreams and ambitions and aspirations  We believe in what is possible  We believe in what can be  And we believe in fighting for that  That s how    that s how we came into being  because the people before us understood that one of the greatest expressions for the love of our country  one of the greatest expressions of patriotism  is to fight for the ideals of who we are  which includes freedom to make decisions about your own body  freedom to be safe from gun violence  freedom to have access to the ballot box  freedom to be who you are and just be  to love who you love openly and with pride  freedom to just be  And that s who we are  We believe in all that  And so  this is a moment where we stand  knowing what we are fighting for  We re not fighting against  It s what we re fighting for  MS  WINFREY  Thank you  Thank you  Madam Vice President   Applause   Thank you  And I want to say     applause     thank you  Madam Vice President  I also want to say  Thank you  Jotaka   Applause   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Thank you  Jotaka  MS  WINFREY  Thank you  Jotaka Eaddy and the Win With Black Women  who started the gatherings on Zoom and all of

still don t know what you re going to do  This is the moment for all decent people  all caring people who want the best for yourself and you want the best for other people  This is the moment for people who are tired of all of the bickering and all of the name calling  people who are exhausted by the craziness    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  MS  WINFREY     and the made up stories and the conspiracies  This is the moment  You want to get on with your life  because you know that we can do better and that we deserve better  You know this  I know you know this  I know you feel this  I know this is what you re saying amongst yourselves  It s in all the conversations that we re having  that you re having  And we re better than this  We re better  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We re better than this  MS  WINFREY  We re better  And we want to create a world where our children will be safe in school again  And as my friend and mentor Maya Angelou always said   When you know better  you got to    AUDIENCE  Do better  MS  WINFREY     do better   Thank you  So  let s do better and vote for Kamala Harris   Applause   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Thank you  Oprah  MS  WINFREY  Thank you to all of our special guests  Thank you for sharing your stories  for being here    Ms  Shanette   Applause   Vice President Harris  we thank you  We hope you keep fighting for us    THE VICE PRESIDENT  I will  MS

Mayor  thank you for being here  and I  inaudible     applause   You ve been   you ve just been extraordinary as a leader and also as a friend  and I thank you so very much  Hi  guys   Applause   I m so happy to see you guys  What schools are represented here  AUDIENCE   Inaudible   AUDIENCE MEMBER  UPenn  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Okay   Laughter   Poor guy  You re the only one in here from UPenn   Laughter    Applause   Okay  Come on   Laughter    Applause   I m so happy to see you guys  You know  I   you guys know how I feel about you and your generation  You all are just killing it  And you are the reason   one of the reasons  for sure  that I am so optimistic and excited about the future of our country  Your generation   seriously  because you guys   the thing I love about you  You re brilliant  you care  you are impatient   Laughter   You re like   I m not waiting for somebody else to handle this  I m going to work on getting it done   which is why you guys are all here  You all have figured out   you know  I think we re all born as leaders  and it s a matter of when you decide to kick it in  and you all have decided to do that at this stage of your life in such a critical way  And every issue that is at play in this election is going to directly impact you  And  of course  you know that  and that s why you re here  because you re taking matters into your own hands  And I think it s really important at a moment like this  when there are some powerful forces  frankly  that are trying to diminish and belittle and suggest that  you know  we have nothing in common and divide us that leaders pull together  build community  build coalitions   right    who really intentionally understand the power in the collective  And you all have figured that out in such an amazing way  And I hope you re making friends with each other  because you re going to run into each other years from now like   Yeah  you remember  24  inaudible      laughter   You guys are going to remember each other when   whether you decide to run for elected office or whatever you decide to do with your role of leadership  So  I hope you re making friends and enjoying each other as you build up what we need to do over the next 49 days  In 49 days  we are going to make such a big difference  and we re going to win  We are winning this campaign   Applause   We are winning this campaign  And I will tell you   and I will tell you  it s very  very important to me  and I know to you that our goal  yes  is that we must and will win and that through these next 49 days  we continue to build community and coalition  Let s leave something for the work we are doing right now that lifts people up  that strengthens people  that strengthens communities  Right  Let s have that as our co equal goal  because that s when we really   combined with the goal  the ultimate goal of winning  that s when we re about building something that will be bigger than any one of us  and it s a great feeling  You all have heard me say probably many times  I think part of what s wrong and backward thinking about what we ve been seeing from some folks is the suggestion that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down  instead of what we all know  The true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up  So  let s do our work   Applause   Let s do our work in a way that is about doing just that  and that includes being a volunteer  You know  I ve worked on many campaigns  and I don t know if some of you know  but I   my first political office that I ran for was freshman class representative of the liberal arts student council   Laughter and applause   Mayor  it was a very tough race  I ran against this girl from Jersey  She was tough   Laughter   But I was from Oakland  so we were all right   Laughter and applause   But I say all that to say that there is so much that you guys are going to do during these next days  It s about knocking on doors and talking with people  You know  I know everyone is living online and through their phones  but the power that I hope you have seen already and you re going to see over these next 49 days   there s an incredible power that comes with just looking somebody in the eye  shaking their hand  asking them   How are you doing  What are you concerned about  What are you worried about  What are your dreams  What are your hopes   It s an incredible  incredible thing you can do when you do that sincerely  And you re going to see that there s a lot of joy that comes with that experience  too  but an incredible amount of power  And so  that s the   that s the joy of   of volunteering  You know  and you going to knock on doors  you re going to call  It is just as equally important  You know  I mean   you know  so many people in my life  they re like   You re the only person who leaves voicemails that I know    Laughter   But they love my voicemails    laughter    because there s something about hearing another human s voice in addition to receiving a text message  Right  And so  you re going to be doing the calls  and you re going to be texting  and you re going to be engaging  And it s a reciprocal relationship  and you re going to be receiving so much in the process  So  thank you all for all that you are doing and that you re committing to do over these next 49 days  I know there are many other things you could be doing  Don t put aside your studies   Laughter   You know  shower from time to time   Laughter   Try to eat vegetables when you can   Laughter   But enjoy it and know   know  most importantly  you are making a difference  You are making a difference  Our country is relying on you guys  We really are  So  keep at it  Thank you for everything  Today is National Voter Registration Day  We   voting registration  I believe  ends October 21st  so we ve got  you know  about a month to get this done and make sure that people are registered  And then we re going to remind them about why it s important that they are  because their voice is their power  their power is their voice  We re going to remind people  Don t ever let anybody silence your power   Applause   Right   Inaudible   So  with that  I ll see you all in these streets  And please take care   Applause   And be well  And thank you  thank you  thank you  Thank you all  Thank you   Applause

Grace   Applause   It s good to be back in Pennsylvania  Hi  everyone   Applause   AUDIENCE  Kamala  Kamala  Kamala  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Okay  Okay  We got some business to handle  Okay   Applause    Laughs   So  let me start by saying to everyone here  thank you for all you are doing and for taking the time to be here this evening  You know  one of the things that I love about everyone who is here and what we are doing  You know  in the midst of this moment where there are people trying to divide us as a nation  trying to make people feel small and feel alone  these are moments that remind all of us that we are all in this together as one loving community   Applause   We re all in this together  We re all in this together  So  thank you all for the time you ve taken to be here this evening  I want to thank also all the incredible leaders  including Governor Shapiro  who you heard from earlier    applause   Senator Bob Casey  who we will reelect to the United States Senate    applause   and Mayor Brown  And thank you  Mayor  for the warm welcome   Applause   All right  So  Pennsylvania  three days ago  Donald Trump and I had our debate   Applause    Laughs   You watched it   Laughs   So   yeah  So  here s the thing  So  I   I take it many people here watched it  So    applause    Laughs   So  you ll remember  that night I talked about issues that matter to families across America  like bringing down the cost of living  investing in America s small businesses  protecting reproductive freedom    applause    and keeping our nation safe and secure   Applause   But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump  AUDIENCE  Noo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Instead  it was the same old show  the same tired playbook we ve heard for years with no plan   no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people  Well  folks  it s time to turn the page   Applause   Let s turn the page  We re not going back  We re not going back  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And   AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And we are not going back because   AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We re not going back because America is ready for a new way forward   Applause   We are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do together  which is why   and  Mary Grace  thank you   which is why Democrats  Republicans  and independents are supporting our campaign   Applause   We need a president of the United States who works for all the American people    applause    and that just stops with all the trying to divide us  Like  people are exhausted with that stuff   Applause   Exhausted  And  you know  my entire career  I have fought for the people  As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland  I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them   Applause   As attorney general of California  I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure   Applause   I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for profit colleges    applause   for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due    applause   for seniors facing elder abuse  And as attorney general of a border state  I took on transnational criminal organizations  like the Sinaloa Cartel  that traffic in drugs and threaten the safety of our communities   Applause   I know these cartels firsthand  and as president  I will make sure we prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law    applause    for pushing poison like fentanyl on our children   Applause   And as president  I will fight on behalf of all communities and all Americans  And together  we will build a brighter future for our nation   Applause   Together  Together  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And that future   and that future we build will include what I call an  opportunity economy  so that every American has an opportunity to own a home  to build wealth  and to start a business  You know  I love our small businesses  So  growing up    applause    I really   do we have small business leaders here  Raise your hand   Applause   Yeah  Right  Right  So  growing up  my sister and my mother   my sister and me had a mother   have a mother   had a mother   excuse me  she passed  But our mother worked long hours  She worked hard  she worked long hours  And my sister  Maya  and I would go over to Ms  Shelton s house  Ms  Shelton lived a couple of doors down  and she helped my mother take care of us  And we  in fact  used to call her our second mother  Well  Ms  Shelton was a small business owner  And I will tell you  since I was a child  I know the character and the   the person who is a small business owner  You re not only business leaders  you re civic leaders  You hold the community together  You re part of the fabric of the community  And small business owners are the backbone of America s economy   Applause   The backbone of America s economy  Which is why part of my plan that you heard about the other night will give a $50 000 tax deduction to start up small businesses    applause    knowing that not everybody  like my opponent  got handed $40 million on a silver tray and then filed for bankruptcy six times    applause    and people sometimes just need the opportunity  because we  as Americans  do not lack for ambition  for aspiration  for dreams  for the preparedness to do hard work  but not everyone has the opportunity  because not everyone has the access  When I talk about building an opportunity economy  it is grounded in that foundational belief that when given an opportunity  people excel every day    applause    every day  Part of my focus is on the fact that we need to build more housing in America   Applause   And so  we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term   Applause   And I have a plan to help lower the cost of living for America s families on everything from health care to groceries  including I will take on corporate price gouging    applause    which  as we know  is about those few bad guys taking advantage of desperate people  And there needs to be a consequence  Under my plan  more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut  including   including expanding the Child Tax Credit    applause    to $6 000 during the first year of a child s life  understanding that new parents need support in that most critical phase of their child s development to help them    applause    buy a car seat  a crib  baby clothes  I will also make sure good paying jobs are available to all Americans  not just those with college degrees   Applause   For far too long  our nation has encouraged only one path to success  a four year college degree  Our nation needs to recognize the value of other paths   additional paths  such as apprenticeships and technical programs   Applause   So  as president  I will get rid of the unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs    applause    to increase jobs for folks without a four year degree  understanding that requiring a certain degree does not necessarily talk about one s skills   Applause   And I will challenge the private sector to do the same   Applause   All of this to say  look  I come from the middle class  I understand where I come from  and I m never going to forget that  And I will always put middle class working people first  It will always be my priority    applause    always be my priority  I know where I come from  I know where I come from  But now  Donald Trump has a different plan  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Just google   just   just look up the Google   Laughter   Just google Project 2025  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  It is a detailed  dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he were elected president again  Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts  like he did before  He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And he wants to impose what I call the  Trump sales tax  on everyday basic necessities  which  as economists have reviewed  would cost the average family nearly $4 000 more a year  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  In fact  independent economists like Goldman Sachs have said my plan would grow our economy    applause    and his plan would shrink the economy  reignite inflation  and send us into a recession by the middle of next year  On top of all of this  Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act  And let s remember   AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Like  we re not here with Trump amnesia  We remember  Remember  when he was president  he tried 60 times to end the Affordable Care Act  And as he said in the debate just this week  he has no   no plan to replace it   Applause   AUDIENCE MEMBER   Inaudible   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Right  Right  You said it  He said he has  quote   concepts of a plan     concepts of a plan   no actual plan  So  let s   let s just think about this for a moment  He s going threaten health insurance for the 45 million people who rely on it based on a concept and take us back   AUDIENCE  Noo   THE VICE PRESIDENT    when insurance companies had   but   because we remember where that was  We remember what that was when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions  Remember what that was like  Remember  Well  we are   AUDIENCE  Not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT    not going back  We are not going back   Applause   No  We are not going back   Applause   Because   because   because ours is a fight for the future   Applause   And   and ours is a fight for freedom    applause    like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do   Applause   And we remember how we got here  Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intent that they would overturn Roe v  Wade  and they did exactly as he intended   Protestor interruption   AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And we   and we understand where we are  We understand where we are  AUDIENCE MEMBER   Inaudible   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Hey  listen  Listen  Now   now is the time to get a hostage deal and ceasefire  I   we have been working around the clock to get that done   Applause   And I respect your voice  but right now I am speaking   Applause   So  on the issue   so  on the issue of fundamental rights and freedoms  we remember how he selected those members of the Supreme Court to undo Roe v  Wade  They did just as he intended  And what we have seen is  in state after state  they passed laws to criminalize health care providers  to punish women  Now  more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban  many with no exceptions   AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT    many with no exceptions for rape and incest  which is immoral  To tell a survivor of a violation to their body that they don t have a right to make a decision about what happens to their body next  that s immoral  And let us agree  One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do    applause    not the government  And I will tell you  when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom  as president of the United States  I will proudly sign it into law   Applause   Proudly  And I m traveling our country  and I ll tell you  across our nation  we are witnessing a full on assault on other hard fought  hard won fundamental freedoms and rights  like the freedom to vote    applause   the freedom to be safe from gun violence    applause   the freedom to join a union    applause   and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride   Applause   And generations   let s remember who we are as Americans  Generations before us led the fight for freedom  And to the friends here  I say  The baton is now in our hands   Applause   It is now in our hands  And so much is on the line in this election  We all know and remember  This is not 2016 or 2020  The stakes are even higher than they were then  because two months ago  the United States Supreme Court essentially told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does  if he gets back into the White House  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails  Imagine what that might mean  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Right  He who has vowed  if reelected  he would be a dictator on day one  AUDIENCE  Booo   THE VICE PRESIDENT  He who calls for the  quote   termination  of the Constitution of the United States  And let us be clear  Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States of America should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States   Applause   Never again  Never again  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  So  Pennsylvania  it all comes down to this  We are here together because we love our country   Applause   We love   we love our country  And we who are here understand the awesome responsibility   the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth  the privilege and pride of being an American   Applause   That s right  AUDIENCE  USA  USA  USA  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America   Applause   So  Pennsylvania  53 days until Election Day   Applause   And we know ours will be a tight race until the very end  We are the underdog  We are the underdog  Let s remember that and know that  And we know how they play  We know how they play  We are the underdog  and we have some very hard work ahead of us  But here s the thing  We like hard work  Hard work is good work   Applause   And with your help  we will win   Applause   We will win  So  Pennsylvania  today  I ask you  Are you ready to make your voices heard   Applause   Do we believe in freedom   Applause   Do we believe in opportunity   Applause   Do we believe in the promise of America   Applause   And are we ready to fight for it   Applause   And when we fight   AUDIENCE  We win  THE VICE PRESIDENT    we win   Applause   God bless you  And God bless the United States of America   Applause  ","","",""

    applause   Representative Manning     applause   Mayor Vaughan     applause   the Council of State candidates     applause   and all the leaders with us today  So  North Carolina  two nights ago  Donald Trump and I had our debate   Applause   You watched it  Did you watch it   Laughs   And look  I believe we owe it to have another debate  right   Applause   We owe it to the voters  Because here s the thing  in this election  what s at stake could not be more important  On Tuesday night  I talked about issues that I know matter to the families across America  like bringing down the cost of living  investing in America s small businesses  protecting reproductive freedom     applause     and keeping our nation safe and secure   Applause   But that s not what we heard from Donald Trump  Instead    you know  and I called it at the beginning of the debate  It was the same old show    same old  tired playbook we ve heard for years  with no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people  Well  folks  look  it s time to turn the page   Applause   Turn the page  I see you   Laughs   America is ready for a new way forward  and we are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic    optimistic about what we can do for our country together   Applause   And that is why Democrats  Republicans  and independents are all supporting our campaign  because we agree    we agree we have a duty as citizens to put country above partisanship and defend our Constitution    and defend our Constitution  And that is my pledge to you  I will always put country above party  From the courthouse to the White House  I have always fought for the people   Applause   Always fought for the people  From being a young courtroom prosecutor    AUDIENCE  USA  USA  USA  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yes  USA  Go on   Applause   From being a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland  California  I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them   Applause   As attorney general of California  I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure   Applause   I stood up for veterans being sued    being scammed by big for profit colleges  for workers who were being cheated out of their wages    the wages they were due  for seniors facing elder abuse  I will be a president for all Americans   Applause   And together    together  we will build a brighter future for our nation  Together  AUDIENCE MEMBER   Inaudible   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And we re    all right  Nupe   Laughs   We are going to build a future where we build what I call an  opportunity economy  so every American has an opportunity to own a home  to build wealth  to start a business   Applause   And let me tell you  I love our small businesses  Are there small business leaders here  Raise your hand   Applause   That s right  That s right  So  you know  growing up    growing up  my mother  she worked long hours  She often worked very long hours  my mother  And so  my sister Maya and I would go over to Ms  Shelton s house  Now  Ms  Shelton  we called her our second mother  She was the second mother to us  She actually was from Louisiana  and she would take care of us in the evenings and on the weekends when my mother was working  And she was a small business owner  And let me tell you what I learned from being a young child about a small business owner  Ms  Shelton  Our small business owners  you are business leaders and you are civic leaders  You are community leaders   Applause   You hire locally  You mentor  You are part of the fabric of our communities  And you  like Ms  Shelton  are the backbone of America s economy     applause     the backbone  So  I have a plan for you  and my plan is to give a $50 000 tax deduction for start up businesses   Applause   Because I understand not everybody  like the person that was on the stage with me the other night  gets handed $400 million on a silver platter and then files for bankruptcy six times   Applause   Come on  Come on  I know what    because  look  my mother  she worked hard  she saved up  and it wasn t until I was a teenager she was able to buy our first home  I know the challenges that Americans and working people and families are having right now in terms of affordable housing  And we need to build more housing in America   Applause   So  part of my plan    part of my vision for an opportunity economy is we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term   Applause   And I have a plan to lower the cost of living for America s families on everything from health care to groceries  including taking on price gouging     applause     and those corporations when they take advantage of people in need  Under my plan  more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut   Applause   Thousands of dollars of your hard earned money will go back in your pockets  including $6 000 during the first year of a child s life     applause     for young parents  knowing in that critical stage of your child s development  you might need a little help  not just to get by but to get ahead   Applause   And I will always put the middle class and working families first  I know where I came from   Applause   I know where I came from  I m clear about that  Now  Donald Trump    well  he has a different plan  Just google  Project 2025   AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  I see you have   Laughs   It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president  Donald Trump will give billionaires massive cuts    massive tax cuts and cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT     even as they pull down record profits  He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And he wants to impose what I call a  Trump sales tax  on everyday basic necessities  which will cost the average American family nearly $4 000 a year  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Some of the top economists in our country and in the world have reviewed these plans  Goldman Sachs  for example  has said that my plan would grow our economy and his plan would shrink the economy     applause     that his plan would reignite inflation and send us into a recession by the middle of next year  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  On top of this    on top of this  Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Now  think about that  Think about that  Think    we remember what it meant when insurance companies could deny you for a preexisting condition  Remember what that was  So  he wants to get rid of it  And as he said in the debate  he made clear he has no plan to replace it  In fact    you remember   Concept    Laughter   Do you remember  He has  quote   concepts of a plan   Concepts of a plan  I mean  we re 54 days from this election   Concepts of a plan   which means no actual plan     laughter     which means no actual plan  And 45 million Americans are insured through the Affordable Care Act  So  understand what that means  He s going to end it based on a concept and take us back when folks were suffering  Well  we re not going back  We are not going back  We are not going back   Applause   We re not going back  No  we re not going back  No  we    we  together  will move forward  because ours is a fight for the future   Applause   And    and ours is a fight for freedom     applause     like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do   Applause   And we remember how we got here  Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT     with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v  Wade    with the intention they would undo the protections  And they did exactly as he intended  And now  more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban  including North Carolina    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT     and every single state in the South except Virginia  many with no exceptions even for rape and incest  It is immoral    immoral  And I know everyone here understands  Let us agree  One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body   Applause   Come on  Come on  And when    and when he was asked on Tuesday night  Donald Trump refused to say that he would veto a national abortion ban  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Well    well  when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom  as president of the United States  I will proudly sign it into law     applause     proudly sign it into law  We are not playing around  And across our nation  we are witnessing a full on attack on hard  fought  hard won fundamental rights and freedoms  like the freedom to vote  the freedom to be safe from gun violence     applause   the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water     applause   and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride   Applause   And here s the thing that I know about all of the North Carolinian leaders who are here  You know this so well as part of your DNA  Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom  Generations of Americans before us  many from right here    AUDIENCE MEMBER  Get a medic  THE VICE PRESIDENT     led the fight for freedom   Applause   AUDIENCE MEMBER  Medic  Medic  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Let s get a medic  Let s get a medic  Do we have a medic  Get    no    let s get a medic over there  please  Let s get a medic a     over there  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Yeah  But let s make sure    see    see  this is who we are  We look out for each other  That s what leaders do  looking out for each other   Applause   Okay  we ve got a medic  Okay  So  generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom  and now the baton is in our hands   Applause   The baton is now in our hands  And we who believe  then  in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act   Applause   And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban  universal background checks  and red flag laws   Applause   So much is on the line in this election    AUDIENCE MEMBER  You got this  Kamala  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And    we got this   Applause   We got this  But look    but look  here s the thing  This is not 2016 or 2020  The stakes are even higher  because two months ago  the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Well    well  here s the thing  the courts will take care of that  Let s take care of November  How about that   Applause   All right   Laughs   But imagine    imagine what that court ruling means  Imagine what that means  Because before  there might have been at least the    the belief that there would be the threat of consequence  but now there s an explicit ruling from the court that suggests he would be immune  Imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Imagine what that would look like  He who has vowed  if reelected  he will be a dictator on day one  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  He who called for the  quote   termination  of the Constitution of the United States  And let us be very clear  Someone who suggests that we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States   Applause   Never again  Never again  Never   Applause   And put that all in the context of people who have been talking about how he was when they served with him in the White House  people who saw him every day    his national security advisor  his defense secretary  his chief of staff  and his vice president    all    all of whom have warned America Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States     applause     and should never occupy our nation s highest office again  So  North Carolina  I believe it all comes down to this  We are here together  We are here together because we love our country  We love our country   Applause   And we together understand the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth  the privilege and pride of being an American   Applause   AUDIENCE  USA  USA  USA  THE VICE PRESIDENT  It s an awesome responsibility  AUDIENCE  USA  USA  USA  THE VICE PRESIDENT  That s right  That s right  That s right  AUDIENCE  USA  USA  USA  THE VICE PRESIDENT  That s right  AUDIENCE  USA  USA  USA  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And I do believe    I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America   Applause   And so  North Carolina  we have 54 days until Election Day     applause     54 days until Election Day and just 35 days until early voting begins   Applause   And it s not only the presidency that s on the ballot  There are many  many important races  like Josh Stein running for governor     applause     whose    whose opponent    whose opponent was handpicked by Donald Trump because he wants a total ban on abortion in this state  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And that is just one of the many stakes that are at play in this election  But see  we know the power is with the people  The power is with the people   Applause   Your voice is your vote  North Carolina   Applause   And you are going to make all the difference in the outcome of this race  And look  we know ours will be a very tight race until the very end  We are the underdog  Let s be clear about that  We are the underdog  And so  we have hard work ahead of us  but we like hard work   Applause   Hard work is good work  Hard work is good work  And with your help  we will win  We will win   Applause   And so  I ask you today  North Carolina  are you ready to make your voices heard  AUDIENCE  Yes   Applause   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Do we believe in freedom  AUDIENCE  Yes   Applause   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Do we believe in opportunity  AUDIENCE  Yes   Applause   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Do we believe in the promise of America  AUDIENCE  Yes   Applause   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And are we ready to fight for it  AUDIENCE  Yes   Applause   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And when we fight    AUDIENCE  We win  THE VICE PRESIDENT     we win

point    to your point  America is ready for a new way forward   Applause   We are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do together  That is why Democrats  Republicans  and independents are supporting our campaign   Applause   Over 200 people who worked for President George H W  Bush  President George W  Bush  John McCain  and Mitt Romney have endorsed me for president   Applause   Former Vice President Dick Cheney and Congresswoman Liz Cheney are supporting me as well   Applause   Because  as they said  we have a duty as citizens to put country above partisanship and defend our Constitution   Applause   And that is my pledge to you  I will always put country above party  and I will be a president for all Americans   Applause   And while Donald Trump is trying to pull our nation backward  we are fighting for the future     applause     a future with affordable childcare  paid leave  and affordable health care  a future where we build

Because  you know  not everybody started out with 40    $400 million on a silver platter and then filed for bankruptcy six times  But a whole lot of people have the ingenuity  the entrepreneurship  the work ethic  and the ambition to do that kind of work and just need to be seen and supported for what they are and what they do for all of us  Applause   An opportunity economy  We need to build

as they pull in record profits  He will add more than $5 trillion to the national debt  He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And he wants to impose what is  in effect  a national sales tax  I call it a  Trump sales tax   because it will be a tax on everyday basic necessities  which the economists have measured will cost the average family nearly $4 000 more a year  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And    and the top economists  they ve previewed our plans  They ve reviewed them  Goldman Sachs says my plan would grow our economy and his

PRESIDENT   Laughs   We re not going back  We re    AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We re not going back  No  We will move forward  We will move forward  because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom     applause     like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do   Applause   And we know how we got to this issue  because Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT     with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v  Wade  and they did as he intended  And now in over 20 states in our nation  they have what I call  Trump abortion bans   including North Carolina    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT     and every single state in the South except Virginia  Think about that  every single state in the south except Virginia  Now one in three women in America lives under a Trump abortion ban  many with no exceptions even for rape and incest  It is immoral  It is immoral  And I know we all here understand and agree  One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body   Applause   And what we know is that the i     the impact of this is    you know  it s been over two years now since that decision came down  The impact of this is so real  It s affecting people every day just based on the stories we know  and there are so many stories we don t know  Think about it  Because of Trump s abortion bans  women are being refused care during miscarriages  Some are only being treated if they develop sepsis  And when asked on Tuesday night  Donald Trump refused to say that he would veto a national abortion ban  You remember that  He refused to answer that question  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Refused to answer that question  Well  I mma tell you  when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom  as president of the United States  I will proudly  proudly sign it into law   Applause   Proudly  And across our nation    across our nation  we are witnessing a full on assault on other hard fought  hard won fundamental freedoms and rights  like the freedom to vote  the freedom to be safe from gun violence  the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water  and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride   Applause   And North Carolina has a history of the point I m about to make  Generations    generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom  and now the baton is in our hands  It is in our hands   Applause   So  we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act   Applause   And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban  universal background checks  and red flag laws   Applause   So much    so much is at stake in this election  So much is at stake in this election  And understand this is not 2016 or 2020 for a number of reasons  including why the stakes are higher  Because two months ago  the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Think about that  Think about that  Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Right  He    he who has vowed that if reelected  he will be a dictator on day one  that he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies  and has called for the  quote   termination  of the Constitution of the United States of America  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Think about that  And let us be very clear  Somebody who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States   Applause   Never again  Never again  Never again  And you know one of the points that I mentioned on Tuesday    so  let    the people who served under him at the White House  who saw him every day    right     his national security advisor  his Defense secretary  his chief of staff  and his vice president all have warned    all  who worked with him every day in the White House  sat with him in the Oval Office    have warned America Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States and should never again occupy our nation s highest office   Applause   So  North    AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And we re not going back  AUDIENCE  We re not

my goodness  Can we hear it for Nicole and Throwback Brewery   Applause   AUDIENCE  Kamala  Kamala  Kamala  THE VICE PRESIDENT   Laughs   Hi  guy     thank you  Thank you  thank you  Wow   Applause   Thank you  all  Thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  It s so good to be back in New Hampshire  Thank you all   Applause   Thank you  And Doug sends his love to everyone as well   Laughs    Applause   Oh  thank you  everyone  Nicole  thank you  You guys are just so extraordinary  and I applaud the way you do the business that you do and the love that you do in giving community  I love our small business owners  It is what you do    I m going to talk a bit about you in a minute  but you are part of the fabric    the essential fabric of a community that cares about one another  Thank you for everything   Applause   Thank you  Thank you  And thank you to the outstanding congressional delegation  Senators Shaheen  Hassan     applause   Representatives Pappas and Kuster     applause   and all the leaders who are here today  Thank you all  Thank you all for    for taking the time to be here this afternoon  Thank you  everyone   Applause   Thank you  So  before I begin  I do want to say a few words about this tragic shooting that took place this morning in Winder  Georgia  We re still gathering information about what happened  but we know that there were multiple fatalities and injuries  And  you know  our hearts are with all the students  the teachers  and their families  of course  and we are grateful to the first responders and the law enforcement that were on the scene  But this is just a senseless tragedy on top of so many senseless tragedies  And it s just outrageous that every day in our country  in the United States of America  that parents have to send their children to school worried about whether or not their child will come home alive  It s senseless  It    it is    we ve got to stop it   Applause   And we have to end this epidemic of gun violence in our country once and for all  You know  it doesn t have to be this way  It doesn t have to be this way  So  we will continue  of course  to    to send our prayers and our thoughts to the families and all those who were affected  including  you know    I    I m going off script right now  but  listen  I mean  you know  at    at the    last year  at    I    I started a college tour  and I    I traveled our country  meeting with our young leaders  right  And so  it was college aged young leaders  So  I did trade schools  colleges  universities  community colleges  By the way  I love Gen Z  I just love Gen Z   Laughter    Applause   Right  But I ll tell you one of the things    one of the things that I asked every time I went to the auditorium    and it would be filled with these young leaders  students    and I d ask them   Raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade you had to endure an active shooter drill   And the    for the    for the young leaders who are here who are raising their hand  I m telling you  every time  the auditorium was packed  and almost every hand went up  You know  a lot of us    I ll tal     I ll speak about myself  You know  we had    well  I grew up in California    earthquake drills  we had fire drills  But our kids are sitting in a classroom where they should be fulfilling their God given potential  and some part of their big  beautiful brain is concerned about a shooter busting through the door of the classroom  It does not have to be this way   Applause   It does not have to be this way  And  you know  this is one of the many issues that s at stake in this election  So  New Hampshire  look  we have 62 days to go     applause     62 days to go  And I m going to tell you what you already know  This race is going to be tight until the very end  So  please  let s not pay too much attention to the polls  because we are running as the underdog  We know what they re capable of on the other side  The only thing we can take for granted is the love that we as Americans have for each other  knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us   Applause   And we ve got some hard work ahead  but we like hard work  Hard work is good work   Applause   Hard work can be joyful work  And so  we are up for the task  And with your help  we will win in November   Applause   We will win in November  And that  in large part  is because we know what we stand for  and when you know what you stand for  you know what to fight for   Applause   We love our country  and we believe in the promise of America  That s so much of what I think brings us all together this afternoon  We believe in the promise of America  and that includes a topic we re going to discuss today  which is what I call an  opportunity economy     building an opportunity economy   Applause   And my vision of an opportunity economy is one where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed  where everyone  regardless of who they are or where they start  can build wealth  including intergenerational wealth  where workers are treated with dignity  and everyone has the freedom to join a union if they choose     applause   where we remove barriers to opportunity  so anyone who wants to start a business can have access to the tools and the resources they need to do that  I believe    and I said it before to Nicole    I believe America s small businesses are an essential foundation to our entire economy  Think about it   Applause   Think about it  Small businesses in our country employ half of all private sector workers  Half of all private sector workers own or run a small business or work for a small business  They do trillions of dollars of business every year  They generate revenue that helps repair our roads and pay our teachers  And  you know     applause     for all of those who are or know of small business owners  the thing I love about you is that you re not only leaders in business  you are civic leaders  you are community leaders  you are mentors  you hire locally  you believe in the community  and you re part of the glue of the fabric that holds communities together  You provide the local meeting space  You are the types of folks where you know who your regulars are  and when someone is walking in the door and you can tell they ve had a bad day  you know exactly what they need  Isn t that the best of who we are   Applause   Isn t that the best of who we are  And I ve met so many entrepreneurs across the country who take the incredible leap of faith that is required to start a small business    folks who put their life s savings on the line and work through the weekends and holidays because they aren t just building a business  they re pursuing a dream  They re building a better future for their employees and for the people they love and their communities  And by extension  they re building a stronger middle class and a stronger America for us all   Applause   And so  all of this is why  as president  one of my highest priorities will be to strengthen America s small businesses   Applause   And here I am in New Hampshire to announce a few elements of my plan to do that   Applause   So  first  we re going to help more small businesses and innovators get off the ground  Okay   Applause   Now I m setting what some  I m sure  are going to call a very ambitious goal  But you know what  I think we should admire ambition in each other   Laughs    Applause   So  I want to see 25 million new small business applications by the end of my first term   Applause   And to help achieve this  we will lower the cost of starting a new business  So  here s the thing  on average  it costs about $40 000 to start a new business in America  That is a great financial barrier for a lot of folks  and it can hold entrepreneurs back  And the current tax deduction for a start up is just $5 000  Okay  So  then you got to make up the delta there  you got to figure out how you re going to do that  Not everyone has access to that kind of wealth and capital  So  part of my plan is we will expand the tax deduction for start ups to $50 000   Applause   It s essentially a tax cut for starting a small business  Second  my plan will help existing small businesses grow  We will provide low  and no interest loans to small businesses that want to expand  and we will    and this is very important    cut the red tape that can make starting and growing a small business more difficult than it needs to be    more difficult than it needs to be   Applause   For example  we will make it cheaper and easier for small businesses to file their taxes  similar     applause     similar to how individuals can take a standard deduction  You know  I said to my team  kind of like    now  I m going to date myself again  because they no longer do it    but kind of like    you remember the 1040EZ  Like  that kind of idea  right  Like  let s just take away some of the bureaucracy in the process to make it easier for people to actually do something that s going to benefit our entire economy  Third     applause     third  my plan will invest in small businesses and innovators throughout America  and here s why  We know that talent exists everywhere in our country  from rural towns to city centers  But not everyone has access to the financing  to venture capital  or expert advice  It s not that they don t have the skills  it s not that they don t have the work ethic  it s access to these resources  So  under my plan  we will expand access to venture capital  We will support innovation hubs and business incubators   Applause   And we will increase federal contracts with small businesses   Applause   And we will have a particular focus on small businesses in rural communities  like right here in New Hampshire   Applause   Finally  my plan will make our tax code more fair  while also prioritizing investment and innovation  So  let us be clear  Billionaires and big corporations must pay their fair share in taxes   Applause   Because here is the thing    here is the thing  It s just not right that those who can most afford it are often paying a lower tax rate than our teachers and our nurses and our firefighters   Applause   It s just not right  It s just not right  So  that s why I support a billionaire minimum tax and corporations paying their fair share   Applause   And while we ensure that the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share  we will tax capital gains at a rate that rewards investment in America s innovators  founders  and small businesses   Applause   So  here s the detail  If you earn a million dollars a year or more  the tax rate on your long term capital gains will be 28 percent under my plan  because we know when the government encourages investment  it leads to broad based economic growth and it creates jobs  which makes our economy stronger   Applause   Now compare that to what Donald Trump plans  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  He intends to cut off federal programs that give loans to small businesses  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts and to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars  even as they pull in record profits  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  His plans will add more than $5 trillion to the national debt  and that is on top of the $2 trillion tax cut he gave them when he was president and when he exploded the deficit  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  We know how to count   Laughter   We know how to count  And now he also wants to impose what  in effect  is a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities  which will skyrocket the cost for families and small businesses  And  New Hampshire  on top of all of this  if Donald Trump were to win in November  he intends to end the Affordable Care Act    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT     which would significantly increase costs on small businesses  as we know    AUDIENCE MEMBER  Lock him up  THE VICE PRESIDENT     and    well  you know what  The courts are going to handle that  and we will handle November  How about that   Applause   How about that   Laughs   That s how we ll handle that  How about that   Applause   But think about it  He wants to end the Affordable Care Act  taking us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions  You remember what that was  Children with asthma  breast cancer survivors  grandparents with diabetes  So  yeah  look  we are here to tell him and them  We are not going back   Applause   We re not going back  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We re not going back  We re not going back  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  No  we are not  and we will move forward  because ours is a fight for the future   Applause   And    and it is a fight for freedom   Applause   And it is a fight for freedom  Now  I don t have to tell the folks of New Hampshire  the  Live Free or Die  state   Applause   You know the importance of individual freedoms  fundamental freedoms  You know how hard people fought for these freedoms and that they are foundational to who we are and what we stand for as America  including the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do   Applause   And understand how we got here  Understand how we got here  And  of course  we re not going to fall for the gaslighting he s pushing  right  AUDIENCE  No  THE VICE PRESIDENT  When he was president  Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v  Wade  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And as he intended  they did  And now  in more than 20 states in our nation  there is a Trump abortion ban  many with no exceptions even for rape and incest  which is immoral    immoral  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And let us agree  and I know we do  One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body   Applause   And if he wins    and if he wins  you can be sure Donald Trump will go further  and he will sign a national abortion ban  And    and you know Project 2025  which I just    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  I mean  can you believe they put that thing in writing   Laughter   And under Project 2025  he would create a national antiabortion coordinator  which would force states    I mean  this is unbelievable  right     which would force states to report on women s miscarriages and abortions  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  You know what they are making really quite clear  They just don t trust women  They just don t trust women  But we trust women   Applause   We trust women  And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom  as president of the United States  I will proudly sign it into law   Applause   Across our nation    AUDIENCE  Kamala  Kamala  Kamala  THE VICE PRESIDENT   Laughs    Inaudible   Across our nation    across our nation    and I ve been traveling for many  many mo     well  years  actually  and certainly months  most recently  Across our nation  I m telling you  we are witnessing a full on attack on hard fought  hard won fundamental freedoms and rights  including the freedom to vote  the freedom to be safe from gun violence    AUDIENCE  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT     the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water    AUDIENCE  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT     the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride   Applause   And so  here s what I don t have to tell the folks of New Hampshire  because you know it so well  it s part of your DNA  Generations of Americans before us  they fought for freedom and they led the fight for freedom in our country  And now the baton is in our hands  The baton is in our hands  So  let us understand  which we do  our purpose at this very moment  Let us remember the broad shoulders upon which we stand and the traditions of this very fight that have led to what we have been able to accomplish  And let us understand  then  that when we say  fight   it is a fight for something  not against something  It is for something   Applause   That s what we re talking about when we talk about a new way forward  This is for something  And so  as an example  let us finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act   Applause   Let us finally pass an assault weapons ban and universal background checks and red flag laws     applause     because we are clear  on that point  it is a false choice to say you re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone s guns away  I m in favor of the Second Amendment  and I know we need reasonable gun safety laws in our country   Applause   And there s another point that I d like to stress about this election in  24  This is not 2016 or 2020  The stakes are even higher this time for a number of reasons  but I m going to mention one  in particular  what the Supreme Court recently did when they basically just told the former president that  going forward  he will effectively be immune  no matter what he does in the White House  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  But let s take this seriously and understand what it means  Before  at least  there might have been the threat that there would be consequence and accountability  With that ruling  what this means is that almost explicitly  he has been told no consequence  And imagine    just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails  Just imagine with no guardrails  He has openly vowed to be a dictator on day one  He has said he would end the independence of the Department of Justice    the United States Department of Justice    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT     so he could have the unchecked power to seek vengeance against people who disagree with him  He even called for    I m going to quote now    the  termination  of the Constitution of the United States of America  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Let us be very clear  Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States of America should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States   Applause   Never again  So  I ll end where I started  When it comes down to it  we are all here together because we love our country  We love our country  and we know the privilege    the privilege and pride that comes with being an American  And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country  That is how we realize the promise of America   Applause   AUDIENCE  USA  USA  USA  THE VICE PRESIDENT  That s right  AUDIENCE  USA  USA  USA  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And so  with that being said  I ask  New Hampshire  are you ready to have your voices heard   Applause   Do we believe in freedom   Applause   Do we believe in opportunity   Applause   Do we believe in the promise of America   Applause   And are we ready to fight for it   Applause   And when we fight    AUDIENCE  We win  THE VICE PRESIDENT     we win  God bless you  And God bless the United States of America  God bless you   Applause   END 3 33 P M  EDT","","",""

labor   Applause   Can we hear it for Tyrese   Applause   Tyrese  I want to thank you for your extraordinary leadership and all of your words and the heart and soul that you put into your work  like I know all the members of LIUNA and everyone here does every day  because we love our country and we know what is at stake  Thank you  Tyrese   Applause   Thank you  So  it is so good to be with so many incredible leaders and elected officials who are here  Governor Whitmer was here earlier     applause   Senator Stabenow  your next United States senator  Representative Elissa Slotkin   Applause   And I always want to thank Representatives Dingell    where is she  There she    there she is   Applause   Stevens  Thanedar  all of you for the work that you do every day  And to all the labor leaders who are here  I thank you all for your extraordinary work  Don t we love Labor Day   Applause   We love Labor Day  It s always been that way  right  The way we celebrate Labor Day is we know that hard work is good work  We know that when we organize  when we bring everyone together  it s a joyful moment where we are committed to doing the hard work of lifting up America s families  And I want to thank everyone here for that work and the way you do it every day  including General President Booker of the Laborers      applause   President Fain of UAW     applause   President Pringle of NEA     applause   President Slevin of the Utility Workers     applause   and President Weingarten of the AFT   Applause   And thank you to all of the union members who are here this afternoon  So  on Labor Day and every day  we celebrate the dignity of work    the dignity of work  We celebrate unions  because unions helped build America and unions helped build America s middle class   Applause   It is true across our nation  and it is true here in Detroit  Nearly 140 years ago  in this very city  10 000 people marched in one of our nation s first Labor Day parades  Many held signs that read  Divided  we can beg  United  we can demand    Applause   For generations  in Detroit and across our nation  the brothers and sisters of labor have stood together to righteously demand fair pay  better benefits  and safe working conditions  And let me say  every person in our nation has benefited from that work   Applause   Everywhere I go  I tell people  Look  you may not be a union member  You better thank a union member     applause     for the five day workweek  You better thank a union member for sick leave  You better thank a union member for paid leave  You better thank a union member for vacation time   Applause   Because what we know is when union wages go up  everybody s wages go up   Applause   When union workplaces are safer  every workplace is safer   Applause   When unions are strong  America is strong   Applause   We know what we re talking about  The labor movement has always understood the power of the collective and the power of unity    the power of unity  And while we are fighting so much nonsense that is about trying to divide our country  trying to pull us apart  look to what the history and the present of labor tells us about the power of the collective and unity    the spirit of that work  as much as the product of that work  It s very telling and gives us really good lessons about what creates strength  And  you know  many of you know  my parents met while they were active in the Civil Rights Movement  So  when I was young  my parents    because I see some young leaders here today    when I was young  my parents would take me to the meetings    I see our young leaders     applause     and    and take me to the marches  I was in a stroller  And from a very young age  I learned that when people stand together  when we join voices  knowing that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us    when we join those voices  we can drive extraordinary change  which is why I believe in my heart and soul no one should ever be made to fight alone  We are all in this together   Applause   We are all in this together  But I ll tell you  I think that there has been a certain backward thinking approach over the last several years  which is to suggest    some folks  them folks    to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we know  The true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up    who you lift up   Applause   That s the measure of the strength of a leader  Let s stop with the nonsense  And in this election  we all here know there are two very different visions for our nation  Ours  focused on the future  the other  focused    AUDIENCE MEMBER   Inaudible   THE VICE PRESIDENT   Laughs   Let s just get through the next 64 days  How about     laughs    Applause   And ours    yes  my dear brother    is focused on the future  and theirs is focused on the past  And we fight for the future  We fight for a future where all people receive dignity and respect and opportunity for    not just for some but for all  That s what we are fighting for  And so  we are 64 days out from the election day  And in Michigan  mail in absentee voting starts in 24 days     applause     24 days  So  this election    this election and our fight is a fight for the promise of America  a promise    AUDIENCE MEMBER  We love you  Kamala  THE VICE PRESIDENT  I love you back   Applause   And ours is a fight for the promise    the promise of America    a promise of freedom  of opportunity  and justice not just for some but for all   Applause   But what we know is  as we fight to move our nation forward  Donald Trump intends to pull us back to the past  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  But we re not going back  We are not going back  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We re not going back  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going

organize  As president  we will always remember Donald Trump blocked overtime benefits for millions of workers    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT     Tyrese talked a bit about this    and opposed efforts to raise the minimum wage  He appointed union busters to the National Labor Relations Board  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And he supported so called right to work laws  And if    AUDIENCE  Trump is a scab  Trump is a scab  Trump is a scab  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Well     well  here s the thing  Here s the thing  We have a choice here  right  And    and we re not going back  because we also know that if Donald Trump were reelected  he intends to give tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations  He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE

Joe  Thank you  Joe  The President  Thank you  Audience members  Thank you  Joe  Thank you  Joe  Thank you  Joe  The President  Thank you  thank you  thank you  Audience members  Thank you  Joe  Thank you  Joe  Thank you  Joe  The President  Folks  I ve celebrated many Labor Days in Pittsburgh  And it s always good to be back with so many great friends  many of whom flew with me on Air Force One today represent the unions that have been with me since the beginning of my career  They re not that old  but they they re  laughter  since I was a 29 year old kid  I want to thank Liz Shuler of the AFL CIO and Kenny of the IBEW for that strong endorsement  By the way  we have an expression in Delaware  The IBEW  when I ran for President  they re the ones that  brung me to the dance  starting off  Not a joke  And Dave McCall and the Steelworkers  Dave  in 1972  Steelworkers were the first union to endorse a 29 year old kid named Joe Biden who wasn t old enough to be Senator when he got elected  It mattered  A guy named Hughie Carcella was the district president  because we used to have one of the largest labor forces in Claymont  Delaware  and north over 4 000 workers  And it was anyway  it all went law it went south  But Hughie Hughie went to the national president  I W  Abel  and he said he wanted me he wanted me to get endorsed  Everybody thought it was crazy  I literally wasn t old enough to be sworn in the day I got elected   Laughter  But guess what  President Abel stuck with me  Audience member  That s right  The President  And they got stuck with me for the rest of their my career   Laughter  Eric Dean and the Iron Workers  Tim Driscoll of Bricklayers  April Verrett and SEIU  Lee Saunders of AFSCME and a great friend  Where are you  Lee  And Jimmy Williams and the Painters and Allied Trades  And his dad  His dad is a really good man  And Mike Coleman and the Sheet Metal Workers  We ve also got some of the best elected officials in America  Governor Josh Shapiro is doing an incredible job  And the great Lieutenant Governor Austin Davis  And one of America s best where is Ed Gainey  Ed  you re doing a hell of a job  And Sara Innamorato  County executive  I think  is the hardest job in American politics  Everybody knows where you live  and they think you can solve all the problems  You don t have enough money  But I tell you one thing  I m the first President ever I used to be a county official when I was 26 years old  and it always bothered me that the county the State the Federal Government would send money to the State to be distributed to the county  What the hell is the State going to send to the county for  All the State reps need the money   Laughter  But guess what  Under my administration  it goes straight to the county  And one of my best friends my name is Joe Biden  I m from Scranton  Pennsylvania  Bobby Casey has been a great friend  His dad was a great friend as well  And by the way  we grew up three blocks from one another  Three blocks  And they still worry about us not showing up   Laughter  And guess what  I was on North Washington Avenue  he was on Adams  Guess what  They ve renamed North Washington Avenue down where I lived  Biden Way    Inaudible  And  Bobby Bob  we ll make sure we get you get reelected again  And while he couldn t be here  I want to thank his partner in the Senate  John Fetterman  If you re in a foxhole  you want Fetterman in there with you  He couldn t be here today  but guess what  He sent the best part of the family  Gisele  She s here  Let me just say  it means so much to be with a true friend a true friend  the Vice President and the next great President of the United States of America  Kamala Harris  Look  folks  I come from two neighborhoods where it s not hard to say the word  union   But you know what  The fact of the matter is an awful lot of politicians have trouble saying  union    Inaudible  working people  Guess what  I m not one of them  Neither is Kamala  We know the simple truth  Wall Street did not build America  the middle class built America  and unions built the middle class  That s a fact  And  by the way  that is a not a slogan  That s a fact  I asked the Treasury Department to do a study  and it shows that when unions do well  all workers in America do better  That s a fact  That s a fact  It s the biggest reason why our economy is the strongest economy in the world today without question because of unions  You know  my dad  like many of his generation  going into World War II  wasn t able to go to college  My dad was a really well read guy  and he was always engaged  And he d come home from work before he d go back and close up the shop and for dinner  And the dinner was a place where we had discussions and  incidentally  ate  You know  my dad taught me my dad would say this all the time   Remember  Joey  a job is  and I give you my word to this  a job is about a lot more than a paycheck  It s about your dignity  It s about community  It s about your place in the community  And it s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say   Honey  it s going to be okay   and mean it   Well  that s why Kamala and I are so proud so proud of the greatest job creation record of any President in a single term in American history  16 million new jobs so far  800 000 manufacturing jobs  Eight years ago  how many times you hear about we can no longer be the manufacturing capital of the world  Where the hell is that written  We are the greatest manufacturing city or county in the world State in the world  inaudible  the world  And we re going to remain that way  And I ll tell you something  Kamala and I are damn proud that we protected the pensions of over 1 million workers and retirees  Remember all those years of promising we were going to do something about it  Well  damn it  we finally did it with the Butch Lewis Act  Over 52 000 workers and retirees across Pennsylvania alone are benefiting from that  Not only did we restore the full amount  we got them their back pay as well  We made them whole again  And as I once said to Barack   That s a big deal    Laughter  Yes  Long story   Laughter  You just heard Liz and Kenny describe another big deal  Union workers are rebuilding American infrastructure and building new factories here in America  They told me we couldn t get anything done in infrastructure  A trillion two hundred billion dollars we got done  Remember Trump  for 4 years  promised every month  Infrastructure Week   For 4 years  he promised that  He didn t build a damn thing  Nothing  I mean it  Not nothing  Well  thanks to our infrastructure law  Pennsylvania  so far  has received $17 billion $17 billion  Over 2 000 projects  from clean water to affordable high speed internet for every Pennsylvanian  to projects that include $858 million to expand the Montgomery Lock better to accommodate bigger barges to get millions of tons of goods and on shelves faster and more reliable and create thousands of union jobs  I was working on the Great Lakes  and I got a call from Bobby from Senator Casey  He s been no bigger champion than Casey for this  You know what I call them  I call them the  Casey Locks    Laughter  Not Goldilocks  The Casey Locks  Bobby is also a champion of Pennsylvania s energy communities  We passed what s called the  Casey credit   available to 45 Pennsylvania counties where energy jobs such as coal where coal mining and had been before and disappeared  before we came to office  The  Casey credit  provides major incentives for companies to build new battery factories  wind turbines  and more to create high paying jobs in those coal and natural gas communities  And on top of that  there s over $4 billion that private companies have committed to invest in clean energy and advanced manufacturing here in Pennsylvania $4 billion  And guess what  With your support  I signed an Executive order to make sure large Federal construction projects all use project labor agreements  For folks at home who may be watching this on television know what project labor agreement is  it s when contractors  subcontractors  and unions put in place before construction begins what the rules are before it begins  These agreements make sure construction is top notch  on time  on task  and by the way  on budget  There s another big deal   Buy American  that s been the law since 1930  I ve got to admit  I ve been around I m only 40  but I ve been around a long time   Laughter  But I  quite frankly  until 10 years ago  wasn t aware you know  back in the thirties  when they were trying to make sure unions could organize and businesses couldn t interfere  they put a law was passed that said every penny the President gets from the Senate  the House  and Congress to spend on a project  he should hire an American worker and use an American product  But past administrations  applause  seriously  Past administrations  including my predecessor  failed to buy American  They shipped jobs overseas where labor was cheaper and brought home the product that was more expensive  But not anymore  Federal projects build American roads  bridges  highways  and they ll be made with American products by American workers  That s why we re creating all these  applause  I m serious  It s simple and basic  That s why we re creating so many good paying jobs  In fact  we re requiring those kinds of projects to pay Davis Bacon prevailing wages so they re jobs you can raise a family on  Many of those jobs don t require a college degree  In fact  we expanded registered apprenticeships  Remember all the hell I got for doing that we got for doing that  Well  guess what  It resulted in hiring over 1 million apprentices since we came to office  And lots of folks don t realize getting an apprenticeship is like getting a college degree  Why  You have to train for 4 or 5 years to get that  And some of the best workers in the world are why the why we are where we are  You know  applause  when you re in Pittsburgh  you re standing with steelworkers  Let s be clear  I believe in American steel companies American owned and operated steel companies  A simple reason it s not hyperbole American steelworkers are the best steelworkers in the world  And I made it clear last time I was in Pittsburgh  United States Steel  an iconic American company for more than a century  is going to remain an American company  I remember as a young Senator why the National Labor Relations Board was sometimes so antilabor  It was set up to help labor  to be prolabor  Well  guess what  That s why one of the most significant things we ve done  Kamala and I  is appointing a National Labor Board Relations Board that actually believes in unions and believes in recognizing the right to organize  Audience member  Thank you  The President  It s a big deal  It s a big deal  Remember we have short memories  I m all for forgiveness  I m not for this  Trump appointed union busters on that Board  Audience members  Boo  The President  No  that s a fact  But it s real  It affects people s lives  Are we going to let that son of a gun do that again  Audience members  No  The President  Folks  we ve made a lot of progress  and Kamala and I are going to build on that progress  and she s going to build on it  I ll be on the sidelines  but I ll do everything I can to help  But look  I m not joking when I say this is not a joke  When I said this when I was running in 2020  a lot of people didn t believe me  You did  but a lot didn t believe me  It s all at risk because of Donald Trump  literally  With a stroke of the pen  he can get rid of a lot of this  And do you think this guy gives a damn about your pensions  Audience members  No  The President  No  I m serious  Do you think he loses even an instant of sleep over it  Audience members  No  The President  Do you think he cares about all the work you do every day and how hard it is  Audience members  No  The President  Do you think he cares about good paying jobs for hard working people who built this economy  Audience members  No  The President  Hell  laughter  he regards picket lines he d rather cross one than walk one  But I have no problem walking a picket line  Never have  Neither nor does Kamala  We ll always walk aside alongside you  Union workers built this country  And  again  that s not hyperbole  That s a fact  These are these are facts  These are not campaign slogans  Let me close with this  Five years ago  I began my campaign for President right here in Pittsburgh  I said one of the reasons I was running was to rebuild the backbone and spine of America the middle class and working class folks  Not a joke  Think about it  Think about it  Well  5 years later  we ve done just that  I m back in Pittsburgh on Labor Day again with a simple message as we look at this election  I spelt  spent  White House correction  my whole career believing in unions  I m not joking when I say that  I m honored to be considered the most pro union President ever  And by the way  remember all the talk   Biden got elected  and he s going to do a planned economy  We re going to collapse  and there s going to be all this caving in  Interest rates are going to go through the ceiling   Come on  man   Laughter  I m here to tell you it s about increasing the strength of your unions  which it s all about  If you care about hard working people  just give them a fair shot  Everyone in America deserves a fair shot  No a fair shot  If you care about the dignity of work if you care about the dignity of work and I mean it  it matters the dignity of work  the way you re treated  the decency  I remember when my great grandfather was one of the only the second Catholic elected statewide to the State senate here in Pennsylvania  And I remember they talked about when he when they were running against him in 1906  they said   Guess what   They said   He s a Molly Maguire   You know what a Molly Maguire was  Well  those of you who don t  a Molly Maguire  back in the in the old days  when we Irish and the Catholics came and then the Poles and others that were Catholic when they came to the United States of America in the beginning  the 1840s and late 1840s  they made their way down into Pennsylvania  a lot of them  And there there s a tier in this in the coal mines  Those guys who got there last ended up being the last people in the coal mines  But a lot of the English owned the coal mines  And what they did was they d really beat the hell out of the the mostly Catholic population who was in the mines  Not a joke  Not a joke  But there was a group  They re called the Molly Maguires  And the Molly Maguires  if they d find out the foreman who was taking advantage of an individual and they d literally kill him  Not a joke  And they d bring his body up and put him on the doorstep of his family  Kind of crude  But I ve got to admit  they accused my great grandfather of being Molly he wasn t  But we were so damn disappointed  But you know  laughter  I that s a joke  That s a joke  Look  it s about the dignity of work  It s about how you re treated  And when I met with the IBEW when I started off this last campaign first  I said   There s two things that asking of me   You re and I said   Two things I m asking of you  One  you ve got to open up your unions to more women   Not joke   And  two  to more minorities   You ve done both that  And guess what  Instead of having the support of 30 percent of the American people  it s now over 65 percent of the American people support the American union movement  Look  it really is all about the dignity of work  And there s only if you care about the dignity of work  there s only one person you have a rational choice with this time  and that s Kamala Harris  Not a  applause   Audience members  Kamala  Kamala  Kamala  The President  Let me tell you about this woman  Audience members  Kamala  Kamala  Kamala  The President  I know her  I trust her  Not a joke  I trust her  Number two  the first decision I made the nomination as nominee in 2020 was selecting her as my Vice President  And by the way  it was the single best decision I made as President of the United States of America  And I was watching something sent to me  When they asked Barack they said Barack picked me as Vice President because he knew I could be President  Well  I know she ll be a good President  I know it  I ve watched her when all the experts  foreign and domestic policy  would give us advice  then we d sit alone in a room  and she has a backbone like a ramrod  And she has the moral compass of a saint  This woman knows what she s doing  Folks  I promise you  if you elect Kamala Harris as President  it will be the best decision you will have ever made  And Kamala believes  as I do  that unions are the spine of this economy  She ll be a historic pro union President  So  folks  we ve got one more job to do together  Let me ask you  Are you ready to fight  Audience members  Yes  The President  Are you ready to win  Audience members  Yes  The President  Are you ready to elect Kamala Harris our next President of the United States of America   Applause  And  in the process  are you ready to make Donald Trump a loser again  Audience members  Yes  The President  I ve never been more optimistic about America s future  We have to remember who we are  We re the United States of America  There s nothing  nothing I mean this from the bottom of my heart there s nothing beyond our capacity nothing when we do it together  And that means elect my friend  our great Vice President  President of the United States  Kamala Harris   At this point  Vice President Harris made remarks

 Joe  Thank you  Joe  Thank you  Joe  THE VICE PRESIDENT  It is good to be in the house of labor   Applause   It is good to be in the house of labor  And it is good to be back at IBEW Local 5   Applause   And can we please give it up again for our president  Joe Biden   Applause   Now  I don t have to tell the brothers and sisters of labor that you really get to know somebody when you re in the middle of a fight  when times are hard  when the forces are mighty  when people don t believe something can get done  and they have a thousand excuses for why it can t get done  And I have spent more time with this extraordinary human being when the cameras were not in the room  when the stakes were high  when the heat was intense  And Joe Biden has always stood with the workers of America and labor unions of America   Applause   Always  Always  I ve been with him when he ll bring folks into the Oval Office  And you know how Joe can get sometimes  He doesn t spare words  It s good that sometimes the cameras are not in the room when he has those conversations   Laughter   Because the thing about the Joe Biden I know    and I know you know  because he has been a frain     friend of labor for so long  for his whole life    Joe Biden can be quite impatient  and that s a good thing for that kind of leader   Laughter   Quite impatient  And I say to all of the friends here  the press that s in the room  History will show what we here know   Applause   Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents in the United States that we have ever witnessed   Applause   And it comes from his heart   Applause   And  you know  Joe and I talk a lot about the fact that we are so proud to be the most pro union administration in America s history  and it s thanks to your leadership   Applause   And  as we know  Joe has still got a lot of work to do  so let s    let s also understand that  So  I want to thank all the incredible leaders who are here today  including the governor  Shapiro  Lieutenant Governor Davis  Senator Casey  who we will reelect this November     applause   Mayor Gainey  President Shuler  President Cooper  all the leaders of labor who are here  all the union members who are here  So  I ll just get right to a few points  I love Labor Day   Laughter   I love celebrating Labor Day  And Pittsburgh  of course  is a cradle of the American labor movement   Applause   It is the birthplace of the AFL  headquarters of the Steelworkers  home to Fire Fighters Local 1  and  of course  the historic IBEW Local 5   Applause   For more than 150 years  the brothers and sisters of labor have helped lead the fight for fair pay  better benefits  and safe working conditions  and every person in our nation has benefited from that work  You know  everywhere I go  I tell people   You may not be a union member  but you better thank unions for that five day work week  Thank unions for sick leave  Thank unions for paid family leave  Thank unions for your vacation time    Applause   Because when union wages go up  everybody s wages go up  When union workplaces are safer  all workplaces are safer  When unions are strong  America is strong   Applause   And we are clear  Not only has Pittsburgh shaped the history of America s labor movement  today you are also shaping its future   Applause   In 2021  with my dear friend  the Secretary  Marty Walsh  who the president appointed to be Secretary of Labor  he and I hosted a meeting right here in this Local  and it was part of the White House Labor Task Force that I lead  That day  we met with a group of computer programmers who were working to form a union  One month later  they signed their contract and became the first    one of the first technology unions in our nation     applause     standing on the shoulder of all those who have been here and fought the good fight  So  Pittsburgh  I r     I remind us of that to say  together  we are fighting to build an economy that works for all working people   Applause   And that has always been the vision of the labor movement  And that is the vision of our campaign   Applause   You know  in this election  there are two very different visions for our nation  one  ours  focused on the future  the other focused on the past  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  We fight for the future   Applause   We fight for a future of dignity  respect  and opportunity for all people   Applause   We fight knowing it s some backward thinking for those folks to have been suggesting for years that the    the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down  You know  that s the stuff they re pushing    that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down    when we know the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up     applause     who you lift up  Do you fight for workers  Do you fight for families  Do you fight for those who must be seen and heard and deserve the dignity that comes with hard work   Applause   That s what we fight for  And when you know what you stand for  you know what to fight for   Applause   So  we re 64 days out from this election   Laughter   Ballots in Pennsylvania will start dropping in 14 days     applause     14 days  And this election is  as much as anything else  a fight for the promise of America     applause     for the promise of America  We love our country   Applause   We love our country  And we know it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country  and that s what this election is about  and about the promise of America  And I don t need to tell unions what the promise looks like  It s what you do every day   Applause   But as we fight to move forward  Donald Trump is trying to pull us backward  including back to a time before workers had the freedom to organize  AUDIENCE MEMBER  He s going to jail  AUDIENCE MEMBER  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Well  the courts will handle that  and we will handle November  How about that   Laughter and applause   We ll handle November  Let the courts handle that other thing  But we re not going back  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We re not going back  And    AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And one of the ways    one of the ways we re going to guarantee we don t go back is that we remember  Right  It is important to remember what that was and what it is  Remember  as president  Donald Trump blocked overtime benefits for millions of workers  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  He opposed efforts to raise the minimum wage  As the president said  he appointed union busters to the National Labor Relations Board  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And don t forget  he supported so called right to work laws  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And if Donald Trump were to be reelected  he intends to give more tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  He wants to impose what  in effect  would be a national sales tax  I call it the  Trump national sales tax  on everyday products and basic necessities that would cost a typical American family    the economists have said this    almost $4 000 a year  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  He intends to repeal the Affordable Care Act AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT     and take us back to what we remember    because it wasn t that long ago    was a time when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions  You remember what that was  Children with asthma  Breast cancer survivors  Grandparents with diabetes  Well  look  America has tried those failed policies before  and we are not going back   Applause   We are not going back  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And instead    and instead  we fight for a future where no person has to go broke just because they get sick   Applause   And so  building on the work of President Joe Biden and I and the work we have done in the White House  we will continue to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and make prescription drugs affordable for all Americans  We     applause     we    we fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to organize  And we will pass the PRO Act and end union busting once and for all  and Bob Casey will help us do that   Applause   We    we see and know and fight for a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead   Applause   And so  we will continue to build what I call an  opportunity economy  so that every American has an opportunity to buy a home or start a business or build intergenerational wealth and have a future that matches their dreams and ambitions and aspirations   Applause   Because  of course  that s the nature of who we are as Americans  We have dreams  We can see what is possible  unburdened by what has been  We have aspirations  We have ambitions  And the system that is a good system is one that supports that and allows people the opportunity to go where they can see and imagine themselves to be  That s what I m talking about when I talk about an opportunity economy  We fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity  and so we will continue to defend Social Security and Medicare and pensions   Applause   And pensions  And pensions   Applause   And we will continue to strengthen America s manufacturing sector  And on that point  the president mentioned it  U S  Steel is an historic American company  and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies  And I couldn t agree more with President Biden  U S  Steel should remain American owned and American operated   Applause   And I will always have the back of America s steelworkers     applause     and all of America s workers  So  friends  64 days until the most  important  election of our lives  and probably one of the most important in the life of our nation  truly  And we know this is going to be a tight race to the very end  It s going to be a tight race to the very end  So  let s not pay too much attention to those

Applause   Hard work is good work  And with your help  we are going to win this November   Applause   We are going to win this November  Yes  we will  So  look  Georgia  let me say  I m no stranger to tough fights  Before I was elected vice president  before I was elected a United States senator  I was an elected attorney general and  before that  an elected district attorney   Applause   And before that  I was a courtroom prosecutor   Applause   So  every day in the courtroom  I stood proudly before a judge and I spoke five words   Kamala Harris  for the people    Applause   My entire career  I ve only had one client  the people   Applause   I stood for women and children against predators who abused them  I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure   Applause   I fought against cartels who traffic in guns  drugs  and human beings  And I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for profit colleges     applause     for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due  and for seniors facing elder abuse  And I will tell you  those fights were not easy  and neither were the elections that put me in those offices  But we never gave up  because the future is always worth fighting for   Applause   Always  And that is the fight we are in right now  a fight for America s future  We    we fight for a future with affordable childcare  paid leave  and affordable health care   Applause   And on that last subject  let s finally expand Medicaid in Georgia     applause     so people can take their child to a doctor or go to an emergency room without going into medical debt   Applause   We    we fight for a future where we build what I call an  opportunity economy  so that every American has the opportunity to own a home  to start a business  and to build wealth and intergenerational wealth     applause     and a future where we lower the cost of living for America s families   Applause   So  when I was attorney general  I went after price fixing schemes  AUDIENCE MEMBER  We love you  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And    love you back  Love you back   Laughs    Applause   And I will tell you  when we get this done together  my friend     laughter     and when I am president  I will take on the bad actors who exploit a crisis     applause     to rip off consumers on everyday items    who rip off consumers on everyday items  like groceries  I will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs and insulin for all Americans   Applause   I will take on the high cost of housing and work with developers to cut the red tape and build millions of new homes   Applause   And I will give 100 million Americans a tax cut  including $6 000 to families during the first year of their child s life     applause     understanding folks just need a little help from time to time  And it s not about just getting by  it s about getting ahead  Six thousand dollars in the first year of a child s life to help pay for that car seat or the crib or the baby clothes   Applause   And unlike Donald Trump  I will always put the middle class and working class families first   Applause   Always  I come from the middle class  I know what I m talking about  AUDIENCE  Kamala  Kamala  Kamala  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And  Savannah  so    but we got some work to do  Okay  We got some work to do  because we know Donald Trump has a very different plan  He has a very different plan  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Just look at his Project 2025 agenda  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Right  If he is elected  Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations  He intends    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And he wants to impose what  in effect  is a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities  And it will cost    the economists will tell you    it will cost a typical American family nearly $4 000 a year  So  Georgia  on top of all of this  if Donald Trump wins in November  he intends to end the Affordable Care Act    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT     to take us back to a time when insurance companies    AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We re not going back  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We re not going back  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We are not    we re going forward   Laughs   AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  And the reason we know we can t go back    to your point  the reason we know we can t go back  On the issue of the Affordable Care Act  remember what that was like before we had the Affordable Care Act  AUDIENCE  Yes  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Remember when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions  Remember what that was like  Children with asthma  Breast cancer survivors  Grandparents with diabetes  So  yeah  we re not going back   Applause   We re not going back  We re not going back  And we will move forward   Applause   Ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom  like the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do   Applause   And understand how we got here  When he was president  Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT     with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v  Wade  and they did just as he intended  And now more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban  including Georgia  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  In fact  every state in the South except for Virginia has a Trump abortion ban  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And think about that    many with no exceptions even for rape and incest  That is immoral    immoral   Applause   And let us all agree  One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do   Applause   Come on  Come on  Come on  And if he wins  Donald Trump will go further  He will sign a national abortion ban  you best believe  And he would create a national antiabortion coordinator and force states to report on women s miscarriages and abortions  It s right there in Project 2025  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  I ve said it before  and I ll say it again  Simply put  They are out of their minds   Applause   Why don t they trust women  Well  we trust women   Applause   And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom  as president of the United States  I will proudly sign it into law  Proudly   Applause   And across our nation  in addition to that  we are witnessing a full on assault on other hard fought  hard won fundamental freedoms and rights   Applause    Protester interruption   Hey  let me    let me ju     let me just say something  Let    hold on  Hold up  Hold up for a second  Hold up for a second  Let me    let me just say something  Let me just say something  We are fighting for our democracy  Everyone has a right and should have their voices heard  I am speaking now  but on the subject  I will say this  The president and I are working around the clock  We have got to get a hostage deal done and get a ceasefire done now   Applause   So  back to this election and Donald Trump  So  in addition to the fight on the fundamental freedom to make decisions about one s own body  I have been traveling our country  and the people of Georgia know what I know  There is a full on assault on hard fought  hard won freedoms and rights  including the freedom to vote     Protestor interruption      the freedom to be safe from gun violence  and an attack on the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride   Applause   And we will fight against all of that  including the freedom to live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis   Applause   Here is the thing  Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom  Now  Savannah  the baton is in our hands   Applause   So  we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act   Applause   We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks and red flag laws   Applause   So much is on the line in this election  So much is on the line  And understand  this is not 2016 or 2020  Things are different  A lot is the same when we think about the issues  and then there is significant differences  The stakes in 2024 are even higher  because consider that the United States Supreme Court recently just basically told the former president that  going forward  he will be effectively immune  no matter what he does in the White House  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Now just imagine    AUDIENCE MEMBER  Lock him up  THE VICE PRESIDENT  Well  the    the courts are going to take care of that  We are going to get him out of    we are going to elect ourselves and everybody here in November   Applause   But I mention the Supreme Court ruling because understand what this means  Just imagine  Before there was at least the threat of consequence  Understand what it now means  and imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails  Imagine what that means when you consider he has openly vowed that  if reelected  on day one  he will be a dictator    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT     that he would end    that he would end the independence of the Department of Justice so he could have unchecked power and seek vengeance against people who disagree with him  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  He even called for termination of the United States Supreme    the cou     the    the supreme land  law  of our nation  the United States Constitution  Think about what that means  And let us be very clear  Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States of America   Applause   Never again  So  it all comes down to this  We are all here together  spending this time together because we love our country  We love our country  We love our country   Applause   And we know the privilege and pride    the privilege and pride that comes with being American   Applause   And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country   Applause   That is how we realize the promise of America  Georgia  for the past two election cycles  voters in this very state  you who are here  have delivered  You sent two extraordinary senators to Washington  D C   Applause   You sent President Biden and me to the White House   Applause   You showed up  you knocked on doors  you registered folks to vote  and you made it happen  You did that  You did that   Applause   And so  now we are asking you to do it again   Applause   Let s do it again  Let s do it again  So  Savannah  are you ready to make your voices heard   Applause   Do we believe in freedom   Applause   Do we believe an opportunity   Applause   Do we believe in the promise of America   Applause   And are we ready to fight for it   Applause   And when we fight    AUDIENCE  We win  THE VICE PRESIDENT     we win  God bless you  And God bless the United States of America   Applause  ","","",""

Thank you  Good afternoon  Welcome uh welcome to Detroit Rock City  as we say   cheers and applause  And uh no matter what your background is  what your politics are  any of that  Before we get going here  those of you serving  who have served  I m sure I speak forever when I say thank you for your service   cheers and applause  Um I d just like to talk for two seconds about my service and there s a point to this  So if it sounds like a little toot of my own horn or a pat on my back  there s a point to this  Uh probably some of the most rewarding  the most rewarding things I ve done in my life and career have been being able to perform for our troops all over the world  From Kosovo  Germany  Afghanistan  Iraq  UAE  Turkey  Italy  England  all across the U S  But how did that start   cheers and applause  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  But I want to tell you a little story of how that started  Many moons ago  some of you younger ones maybe weren t even walking yet  There was a horrible attack  a terrorist attack in Yemen on one of our ships called the USS Cole  where 17 sailors lost their lives  And when they were getting towed out of that harbor  you can imagine their brothers and sisters  people serving with them were pretty upset  pretty pissed off  but the upper brass said they could play patriotic music while they re getting pulled out of there  And one of those wise guys put on a little song by myself called American Badass  and they were pretty upset  I got a few pictures with these guys after losing 17 of their brothers and sisters  They got F Yemen across their chests and a couple middle fingers in the air  And it gave me chills when I found out about it  But more importantly  my mother  who s with me today  just celebrated her 80th birthday   applause  It was her  who I might note that her father  my grandfather and my uncle and her brother served in World War II and Vietnam  suggested she said   You know  should do something to help out with them   And this was kind of before all the crazy wars and everything in the Middle East broke out  And I said   You know what  You re right   And I was raised to be very patriotic and love my country  And  and so it just happened we were playing in Virginia where we have a big presence in our military and the Navy and I was able to play a show there and donate that money to the families of those 17 sailors that lost their lives  And that was because one reason  because of my mom  Susan Ritchie  So how about an applause for mama Rock who s here tonight   cheers and applause  She s a little shy  She s a little shy  Probably back there cutting it up with the president   laughter  I also apologize  I did not get the dress memo today clearly  But enough of me rambling on here  There she is  Hi mom  Love you  Now  enough of me rambling on  Once again  welcome to our beautiful city  Detroit  I m so proud to be from in and around here  It s great to be back  especially with so many of you great patriots  So let s bring on the man now  right  Probably want to hear somebody else speak   cheers  Well  how about we give a big old Detroit welcome  a huge military salute and welcome to our 45th and soon to be 47th President of the United States  President Donald J  Trump   music  Lee Greenwood  God Bless the USA   TRUMP  Thank you  Having Kid Rock  sometimes referred to as Bob  I call him Bob  but he s a great guy  I ll tell you that  he s a great guy and a talented one  and it s an honor to be with all of you incredible patriots  really an honor  a great one  And I m thrilled to be here in Detroit with the incredible men and women of our National Guard  Very special people  I ve had no greater honor in life than to serve as your Commander in Chief  and you are always ready and always there for us and for the President of the United States  you are always there for me  I will tell you and I m always going to be there for you   cheers and applause  Thank you  And we re doing very well as you probably see  And hopefully I can say when I m back in the White House  I ll get you the support  funding  training  and equipment you need  and I will get you the pay raises that you ve really deserved for a long time   cheers and applause  We ll get it taken care of  For a long time  I want to thank the Chairman of the National Guard Association of the United States  Major General Janson D  Boyles  and also Vice Chair Major General Jimmie Cole   applause  Thank you both  Thank you very much  I also want to thank members of Congress  very special warriors and patriots  they re very strong people  They love our country  Lisa McClain  Where s Lisa  She s so incredible  applause  Lisa  thank you  Thank you  Lisa  John James   applause  John  thank you  John James is a star and doing really well  Thanks John  Tim Walberg and Michael Waltz  Thank you very much Michael and Tim  And again  I want to thank Kid Rock for being here  He s really been a great friend of mine for a long time  Each and every one of the guard members here today inherits the proud spirit of the citizen soldier running all the way back to the Minutemen who stood against tyranny at Concord Bridge  Has everybody heard of Concord Bridge  Yes  I think so  You carry forward the legacy of Old Hickory division that earned more medals of honor than any division in the army in World War I and the North Dakota Guardsmen who ve walked through hellfire at Guadalcanal   applause  And it was the Air National Guard that thundered into the skies to defend us on 9 11  We all remember that all too well  And when our country is hit by fire  flood  or vicious storm  America turns to the National Guard because we know we can always count on you  We always can count on you  I ve counted on you a lot  The National Guard is America s first and last line of defense  and you do not get the credit you deserve  But actually  you do because down deep everybody knows it  You get a lot of credit in your own way  a little bit different  But we really respect and appreciate the job you do  Thank you to every Guardsman for your selfless service  I want to thank also our amazing National Guard families because  especially the spouses and the children  cheers and applause   I mean  let s face it  without which you would never be the same  You d never be the same  But they sacrifice so much  All of us in this room have something very special in common  We re all proud  hard working citizens who have stepped forward to defend American freedom  And we continue to do that  And it s why I m here today because America s future is under threat like never before right at this moment in my opinion  our country is at the most dangerous level we ve ever been  And I hate to say this  but we have a president who went on vacation a week ago and now he came back and he went on vacation again  And we have people that are fighting all over the place and threatening our country as we speak  I don t think we ve ever been closer to World War III than we are right now  It s a terrible thing  Our country is being destroyed by a radical political class that sends our guardsmen and women to defend the borders of distant foreign nations while they surrender our own borders to an invasion right here at home  the likes of which we ve never seen before  You miss birthdays and holidays deploying overseas in the global war on terror  Only Kamala Harris is letting terrorists come into our country at record numbers and letting Jihadists pour into our homeland by the thousands and thousands and thousands  Can t do that  And while you have risked your lives to defend our rights and liberties and our borders  our opponents have waged war on those liberties from the White House  attacking free speech  censoring dissidents  and trying to put their political opposition in jail  Never happened before  I m in this fight to defeat the corrupt political class in Washington that s hurting you very badly  whether we know it or not  and to reclaim America s future as a free and sovereign nation ruled by the American people  When I m back in the White House  we will expel the warmongers  the profiteers  and take over our government and we will restore world peace and it will be again  peace through strength   cheers and applause  On day one  I will seal the border and I will stop the invasion of millions of people into our country   applause  We will find and remove the terrorists and jihadists who have infiltrated our soil  And under my leadership  we ll bring back the values that you enlisted your lives to defend  sovereignty  liberty  free speech  and fair  equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law  We are not just going to make America great again  We re going to make American democracy great again  We re going to bring it back  My opponent  Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are promising the exact opposite  They want endless war  open borders  voting rights  and free healthcare for illegal aliens  Soviet style price control  censorship  unlimited migration from terrorist hotspots and unchecked power for the deep state  This fight is no longer between Democrats and Republicans  This is a fight between communism and freedom  It s very serious fight  That s why millions of traditional Democrats  including FDR Democrats  JFK Democrats  independents  and old fashioned liberals are joining our movement  Our poll numbers are great  We re uniting forces to end the endless foreign wars  stop the censorship  end weaponization of our government  defend our borders  rebuild our middle class  protect the health of our children and  above all  to restore our republic and vanquish the corruption that s all over Washington D C  right now  Three days ago  I was honored to receive the endorsement of Robert F  Kennedy Jr  We re very proud   applause  Thank you  We re very proud to welcome Bobby to our cause  He s really a terrific guy  He s a terrific person and he s going to do a lot of great things  I have no doubt about it  He s got some very good ideas  Some ideas that people weren t listening to  it s turned out to be right  And today I m honored to officially welcome another true American patriot  a 17 year veteran of the Hawaii Army National Guard  a four term Democrat congresswoman  Very  very popular  The former vice chair of the National Democratic Party and a 2020 Democrat candidate for the United States presidency  She was a very good candidate  Every time she ran  she was good  She did well  She decided to leave  She couldn t take it anymore  But she is very special  And I didn t know this  but she was a lieutenant colonel  That s not bad  lieutenant colonel   laughter  Not bad  I didn t know that  I just found out  I said   Put it down  You gotta put that down  That s bigger that s better than all the other stuff I read   But no  she s a special person  She s got great common sense  great spirit  She loves our country and she loves the people in this room  Tulsi Gabbard  Tulsi  please   cheers and applause  TULSI GABBARD  Thank you very much  TRUMP  Have a good time  GABBARD  Thank you  Thank you  Mr  President  Aloha  CROWD  Aloha GABBARD  I know we got Hawaii in the house here   cheers  There we go  It is a privilege to be here with all of you  my brothers and sisters in uniform  especially on this day of all days  I had the privilege of joining President Trump this morning at Arlington Cemetery  where he joined two Gold Star families and loved ones of Staff Sergeant Hoover and Sergeant Gee  both of whom were two of the 13 killed in the Abbey Gate attack three years ago today in Kabul  And I can tell you  as we were there  as he laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier  joining these Marines loved ones  I felt the sorrow that he shared with them in their loss  I felt and saw his sincere appreciation for these servicemen and women who paid the ultimate price and their loved ones who continue to grieve to this day  This is personal for me as I know it is for so many of you here  This is real  It s not just words  I first deployed to Iraq in 2005 with the Hawaii Army National Guard as a member of Charlie Med   applause  As those of you who were deployed during that time know  it was at the height of the war  and sadly  we took many casualties  And every day we were confronted with that high human cost of war and that sadness as we boarded the plane when we left  that we were leaving some of our brothers and sisters behind only to lose others when we got home to suicide  So I mean what I say when I share with you that I know that President Trump understands the grave responsibility that a president and Commander in Chief bears for every single one of our lives  Whether you re a soldier  you re an airman  a Marine  sailor  or a Coastie  he keeps us in his heart in the decisions that he makes  We saw this through his first term in the presidency when he not only didn t start any new wars  he took action to de escalate and prevent wars  He exercised the courage that we expect from our Commander in Chief in exhausting all measures of diplomacy  having the courage to meet with adversaries  dictators  allies  and partners alike in the pursuit of peace  seeing war as a last resort  The truth is  as we head towards our decision as a country in November  The same cannot be said about Kamala Harris  In fact  the opposite is true and we are living through this reality today as this administration has us facing multiple wars on multiple fronts and regions around the world and closer to the brink of nuclear war than we ever have been before  This is one of the main reasons why I m committed to doing all that I can to send President Trump back to the White House  where he can once again serve us as our Commander in Chief   cheers and applause  Because I am confident that his first task will be to do the work  to walk us back from the brink of war  We cannot be prosperous unless we are at peace and we can t live free as long as we have a government that is retaliating against its political opponents and undermining our civil liberties  weaponizing our very institutions against those they deem as a threat  Kamala Harris has done this over the last three and a half years  She won t hesitate to continue that if she is elected as president  President Trump has been their first and foremost target in this because they don t want us as voters to even have the option to vote for him  I ve been their most recent target  Added to a secret domestic terror watch list after exposing the truth about what kind of dangers we would face if Kamala Harris is elected as president  We as Americans must stand together to reject this anti freedom culture of political retaliation and abuse of power  We can t allow our country to be destroyed by politicians who will put their own power ahead of the interests of the American people  our freedom and our future   applause  I am proud to stand here before you today  whether you re a Democrat  a Republican  or an independent  if you love our country as I do  if you cherish peace and freedom as we do  I invite you to join me in doing all that we can to save our country and elect President Donald J  Trump and send him back to the White House to do the tough work of saving our country and serving the people  Thank you very much   cheers and applause  Thank you very much  Mr  President  TRUMP  Well  thank you Tulsi  I heard that might happen  but I wasn t sure  And it happened  because she s really an amazing  really an amazing person  So I look forward to working with Tulsi and everybody  Everybody in this room actually  And as Tulsi mentioned  early this morning  Tulsi and I were at Arlington National Cemetery with the families of service members who lost their lives in the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan  Not that we withdrew  but the way they did it  We were going to do it with dignity and strength  We were in the process of getting out  We would ve never given up Bagram  one of the biggest air bases in the world  one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons  We gave it up  We gave it  We gave them everything  China took it over  China now occupies it  Can you imagine  The longest  most powerful runways  I think eight feet of concrete down  and we gave it all up  Spent billions and billions of dollars years ago building it  One hour away and we re gone  And now China occupies it  Today marks the three year anniversary of the terrorist attack at Abbey Gate  Now  we say Abbey Gate  a lot of people don t know what that means  It means Afghanistan that left 13 American service members dead  dozens more badly wounded and many innocent civilians also killed and injured  Hundreds of people killed  Never been anything like it  It s the wrong base  Shouldn t have taken the soldiers out first  Should have taken the soldiers out last  That s where you d want to be  They took the soldiers out first and they had a field day at our expense and our reputation  We will never forget those brave warriors who made the supreme sacrifice for our country  They will live in our hearts forever  And to all the gold star families  our gratitude is everlasting  will be everlasting always  We will honor their memory by restoring a government that puts the American people first  Caused by Kamala Harris  Joe Biden  the humiliation in Afghanistan set off the collapse of American credibility and respect all around the world  And the fake news doesn t want to talk about it  They don t even talk about the three year anniversary  Terrible word to use  but that s what they re calling it  an anniversary  It s really  I think of anniversary is a little bit different  but it s three years now and the fake news doesn t even talk about it  Our country will never be safe again until we have fired those responsible for this disaster  Nobody fired  Worst  most embarrassing in my opinion  the most embarrassing day in the history of our country  It gave us Russia going into Ukraine  It gave us the October 7th attack on Israel  Because it gave us lack of respect  We re not respected  We were respected very much four years ago  We re not respected now  The voters are going to fire Kamala and Joe on November 5th  we hope  And when I take office we ll ask for the resignations of every single official   cheers and applause  We ll get the resignations of every single senior official who touched the Afghanistan calamity to be on my desk at noon on Inauguration Day  You know you have to fire people  You have to fire people when they do a bad job  We never fire anybody  You gotta fire them like on The Apprentice  You are fired  You did a lousy job  You did a terrible  terrible disservice to our country  You get fired when that happens  Nobody got fired  Nobody ever gets fired in this administration  It s amazing  All the bad things that have happened  Nobody ever gets fired  The problem is when you fire somebody  they always end up writing a book about you   laughter  I ve had more books written about me  I fire a lot of people when they don t do a good job  I get a book written about me by all these losers that get fired   laughter  Every crisis Kamala and Biden have created on the world stage can turn around very quickly and we re going to turn it around  But only we need strong leadership  We need a big victory  November 5th will be the most important day  my opinion in the history of our country   cheers  Be the most important day  In four short years  thank you  under the Trump administration we built  you know it  You know it better than anybody  Rebuilt the US military  We obliterated ISIS  So ISIS was going to take five years   Sir  I don t know if you re going to be able to do it in five years   Five years we have those beautiful jets for $150 million apiece and they have knives and rifles  I don t understand why  I traveled  You know that I traveled to Iraq  Late at night  I got in  I traveled  They said   Sir  would you do us a favor  Close your windows  We re turning off the lights  We re getting ready to land in Iraq  at a great base in Iraq   And I went because I wanted to see why we re not winning against ISIS  We ve been fighting them for 20 years  And I was told by my Washington DC generals that it will take five years   Five years  sir   I said   I don t get it   And I went there and I met real generals  And you know the story  you ve probably heard the story  but I had one in particular  Raisin Caine  I said   Raisin Caine  Your name s Raisin    Yes  sir  They call me Raisin Caine    What s your first name    Dan  But they call me Raisin  sir    So your name s Raisin Caine    Yes    I love you  This is what I m looking for  I m looking for Raisin Caine   And anyway  we sat down and we had a meeting  He said   Would you like to rest    No  I don t need resting  Unlike other people that we know    laughter  We don t need to rest  He d rest and then leave  There d be no meeting  I said   Let s go now   I said   How do we beat these guys    Sir  we can do it quickly   I said   No  They say it s going to take a long time  How can you do it    Four weeks  sir     What    We can do it in four weeks  sir   They didn t use our resources  They wanted to be politically correct  They didn t fly out of areas where they thought the country may be a little angry at us  even though we support those countries and we can do it in four weeks  sir  Well  what are you going to do  We re going to have auxiliary airports you know military ports  You know all about them  Sort of portables  I think he called them  but they re out in the desert all over the place  We want to use them and we ll use here  But they wanted to fly from here  and it s a long distance  sir  By the time we got there  we had to come back  I said   So what would you do   He said   Well  I d leave from seven places and we ll hit them from the left  We ll hit them from the right  And we ll hit them underneath and on top  We ll hit them so much  They won t know what the hell is happening  sir    And four weeks we ll do it  sir    Four weeks  They said five years    Four weeks is all we need  sir   And that s what it took  Can you believe it  I said   Go ahead   I made a couple of phone calls first  I said  is this guy serious  Is he serious  He did it  He knocked it out  He knocked it out  So I can tell you about some of those  what a period of time that was  And I tell that story sometimes because I want to just say  we have an unbelievable military when we have the right leader   applause  We have an unbelievable military  Really true  And they re not going woke  Maybe a few people on top or woke  but those guys  they ll never be aw woke  They could be put in a room and preached to for the rest of their lives and they won t go woke  And we know them  I saw them  I saw them  What they did  I saw what they did what they did with ISIS  We knocked out 100  quickly of the ISIS caliphate because we decided to fight  We have the greatest people in the world  We have the best equipment in the world  Now  we did give about $85 billion worth of it to Afghanistan  You know that Afghanistan is one of the largest sellers of military equipment in the world  They sell the stuff that we stupidly left there  We left them $85 billion worth of brand new tanks and planes and even goggles  They didn t fight at night  You know why  They couldn t see  Now they can fight at night  It s not even believable how stupid these people were to allow this to happen to our country  and we became a laughing stock all over the world  And we buried 13 soldiers  They never mentioned the 45 soldiers that just were so badly hurt  obliterated  legs  arms  face  They don t mention  We left Americans behind  We left all of that equipment behind  And if we would ve left from Bagram where you have hundreds of acres as opposed to a small little airport in the middle of the city where everybody just came in and it was a mess  You wouldn t have had any of the problems  But you should have again  taken the military out last  If I asked a five year old child   What do you think   Here s the facts  Give him one minute   Would you take the military out first or    Sir  I d take the military out last of course   But our guys didn t do that  But I just it s embarrassing to even talk about it  And I wasn t there  You had another group there  but it s a very big embarrassment because I love the country  I want our country to be respected  And we lost a lot of respect at that moment  And it s so easy  It was so easy  Because we were getting out  but we were getting out with strength and dignity  Think of it  18 months  not one soldier was killed under mine  And I spoke to Abdul  I told Abdul   You can t do that  Can t do it  It s going to be bad  Abdul    laughter  And he said   Your Excellency  but why do you send me a picture of my house    Oh  did I send that to you   cheers and applause  I didn t  Did I send you a picture  Did I send you a picture  I don t remember that Abdul   But  and honestly  he was fine  18 months  they were knocking out our soldiers  one by one  especially under Obama  Barack Hussein Obama  They were knocking out our soldiers one by one  snipers  We didn t have one soldier killed  even shot at in 18 months  And then these guys took over and big lack of respect  But they had a lot of respect for us during that period  Think of that  Isn t that amazing  Not one soldier was shot at  let alone killed  Nobody killed  But I m proud to be the first president in decades who started no new wars  And the reason I started no new wars is they respected the people in this room   applause  It s true  You don t want to have wars  I ended wars  I could have been in a mess like you have right now  You have every place  The whole world is blowing up  And World War III  if something doesn t happen fast  And that s going to be a World War like no others because of nuclear power and other power that s out there  But we had no wars  Very proud of that  I finished a couple of wars and I got troops out between Turkey  If you take a look  Turkey and Syria  remember we had 5 000 soldiers in between two armies  and I took them out  I said   Wait a minute   I called a couple of generals  I said   How do 5 000 soldiers do when you have one army of 400 000 people  another army of 300 000 people  and they re in the middle  can they do well   They said   It s not going to be good  sir   I say   Get him the hell out of there  That border s been there for 2 000 years  They ve been fighting over it   The fake news back there  They hit me hard  They said   He removed   You know what happened  Nothing  They just kept it the way it s been for 2 000 years under different names and saved a lot of lives  Would ve been bad  But I did a lot of that  and I was very good at using a telephone  We didn t have to send soldiers and kill everybody  although we had some of that too  You know that  With Russia  Where they came at us  I can t do that  Came at us again  I said   You can t do that   They came us at us the third time and you know what happened  A lot of people  People don t talk about it  but they know about it  And they learn not to play around with us  They learn that  Because again  we are the best  But we re not going to be the best for long if it keeps going like it is right now  Before I even arrive at the Oval Office  shortly after I win the presidency  I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled  I ll get it settled very fast   applause  I don t want you guys going over there  I don t want you going over there  And I m the only candidate in this race who can make this promise  I will prevent this is for the spouses  I will prevent World War III  Nobody else is going to prevent it  You re going to end up in World War III  Look at what s going on right now with Ukraine  Their surging into Russia  Okay  You re going to end up in World War III and it s going to be a bad one  When I m President  America will be respected again  respected like never before  They were respected four years ago  Viktor Orban from Hungary  Prime Minister  he s known as a very tough leader  tough man  good man  but a tough man  but one of the toughest in Europe  And they asked him a little while ago  why is it that the whole world is blowing up  He says   because President Trump isn t the President of the United States  If he were the President of the United States  none of this stuff would be happening right now  None of it  None of it at all   And I believe that s true  That s true  For that to have happened is crazy  I ll take immediate action to restore our depleted military  You know we don t have any ammunition again  Do you remember when I first came in  They said   sir   right   Trump points at crowd member  I see that guy  Sounds like you were pretty much involved with trying to fill it up  I like that guy  I don t know who the hell he is  Stand up  Let me see  Stand up  He s like central casting  but that s come on  stand up right there  That s good  I like that guy   applause  It s true  though  True  We had no ammunition  I took over  They came to me   sir    How are we doing militarily    We have a problem  sir    What is it    We have no ammunition   That s a lousy thing  You know  you re running a country  we got enemies  and if you have the smart President  you ll be able to do fine  but you don t want to tell your enemy you have no I don t want to tell President Xi of China we don t have ammunition  But before that  they came out with a report  before I got there  saying that the United States has no ammunition  I said   Who would release a report like this   Even if it s true  you don t talk about it  right  We do a lot of reports that are stupid reports  like a report that came out a couple of ","weeks ago that we would lose in a war with China  You saw that report  We re not going to lose in a war with China  That we would lose in a war with China  how stupid are these people that would put a report like that  If you feel we re a little weak  you gotta strengthen it up  but you don t do reports that we re going to lose to China in a war  Stupid people do that  like the people that are in office right now   applause  I had  and you will say it  I had ammunition  We had so much  it was coming out of our gills  right  I had ammunition I said   what the hell do we do with all this ammunition   We had so much  And now we don t have ammunition again  We gave it all away to different groups  but mostly into Ukraine  and we don t have ammunition  We had so many missiles  we didn t know if we could fire them all  We had to hire teams of people  Even the concept  we had so much  Warehouses were full  We took new warehouses and now we re back to a point where we have no ammunition again  These people are just so destructive  So I always look for good words  highly sophisticated  and I m highly educated  I like sophisticated words  but there s only one word I can stupid  They re stupid people  I d like to say  I guess you could say incompetent sounds maybe a little better  I don t know which is better  being stupid or being incompetent because they re both   laughter  We have no ammunition again  but we ll get it taken care of  Boy  oh boy  can you imagine if they wanted to go after us  Can you imagine that  And we re saying they have no ammunition  This was just released a little while ago  We give so much of it away  We never get anything for it either  Europe  by the way  is much more  and should be much more  concerned  obviously  with the Ukraine situation than us  but we ve spent $150 billion more  Why do we spend 150 billion  Why aren t they going to equalize  They should equalize  I told them  I said   you gotta equalize it   They don t like then I read Barack Obama is much more popular than Donald Trump  Of course he is  He said   we ll spend all the money   I say   you gotta pay up   And that s what happened  I got NATO to pay up hundreds of billions of dollars  but then now we ve lost it again because nobody s I ll bet you nobody s ever asked Europe to pay up  They don t even ask  I ll bet you that nobody said to Europe   we re 150 billion more than you   They have about the same size economy when you add all of the different nations up as us  and nobody has said to them   gotta pay up   I did that  I was with NATO  They were way behind  Of the 28 nations  almost all of them were not paid  Other than that  they were doing quite nicely  Thank you  But we had seven that were paid and the rest weren t  And Obama came in  made a speech  Bush came in  made a speech  I came in and said   you guys owe us a lot of money  because we were spending our money  So think of it  They take advantage of us on trade because they are horrible to us on trade  the European nations  Horrible  They don t take our farm products  When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in the middle of Germany  Maybe never  I said to Angela   Angela  do you have any Chevrolet s or Fords in the middle of Munich    No  I don t think so   But we have plenty of Mercedes Benz s and BMW s  Volkswagen s  Millions and millions of cars  So they get us in the military  then they get us on trade  On top of everything else  It s not a good way  I was straightening it all out  It was getting straightened out very quickly  And very interesting  though  I said   who would do this  Who would do this   Hundreds of billions of dollars we lose in the defense of Europe  All I say is   let s equalize  We ll help you  but you owe us 150 billion   And during one meeting  I remember  NATO  one of the heads of countries  I won t embarrass him by saying which one  but we had 28 countries gathered round the table  it was sort of a semi secret meeting  which nothing secret in this world  but some of the press didn t want to report it because it was a good story  But one of the leaders stood up  said   does that mean   He wasn t paid  He owed us billions   Does that mean if we don t pay you  you re not going to defend us against Russia   I said   that s what it means  Are you saying you re delinquent   I don t know about that word  That s a real estate word  Very simple word  It means you re not paid   You re saying you re delinquent    Yes  let s say we re delinquent  Will you defend us   I said    absolutely not   I took so much heat from the fake news media  Now  if I said   yes  I will defend you   they re not going to pay  What happened is hundreds of billions of dollars came pouring in because I said that   applause  Hundreds of billions of dollars came pouring in and they have money  but this should not be happening  This should not  This mess that s going on over there now is very dangerous and it shouldn t be happening  I m the one that got them the money  Literally hundreds of billions of dollars came right in  Guys that were not paying for years  But other Presidents never even asked them for the money  They d make a speech and leave  Literally  I was getting ready to make a speech  I said   let me see some statements   I looked at some  I said   nobody s paying   We paid for everybody  We were keeping it solvent  One of my proudest achievements on my first term was to create Space Force  the first new branch of the armed forces in over 70 years  That s a big deal  Now that Space Force is up and running  I agree with your leadership  you want this very badly  but I agree that the time has come to create a Space National Guard as the primary combat reserve of the US Space Force   cheers and applause  Very good  Very good  Thank you  Thank you  So as President  I will sign historic legislation creating a Space National Guard  until I spoke to somebody that s a great guy  very much a fan of yours  Marco Rubio  I said   what do you think   He said   I love this  I love it  I love it   So we re going to do that  Space Force has been very important  Very  very important  When I did that  other people came in  they wanted to end it  and they were just hammered because people realized how important we were getting just destroyed in space  And now we re leading  We are leading with all of the major metrics in space  Russia and China were killing us because we didn t really have a focus on it  And once you did that  we have a focus  and now we re leading in space  Throughout the Armed Forces  we will make a historic investment in building a US military for the 21st century  investing heavily in drones  robotics  artificial intelligence  Hypersonics  You know hypersonics was us  Somebody stole the stuff and Russia ended up making them  but we re making them now  But Russia ended up making that  super speed missiles  They go about seven times faster than a regular missile  which is quite fast  And uh we re going to build a great Iron Dome for missile defense around our nation  Other countries has it  Israel has it  Ronald Reagan wanted this many years ago  but we didn t have the technology at that point  But now we have the technology  so we re going to do the Great Iron Dome  and it s all going to be built in our country  We re going to build it right here   cheers and applause  And as your Commander in Chief  I will ensure that the National Guard members have access to train on the same state of the art equipment as active duty forces  We re going to make sure about that   applause  And I ll also get you reinforcement for allies abroad  making them pull their weight  They have to do that and they have to pay their fair share  as I was saying  And for years  all of these NATO countries spent far less than 2  of GDP on their militaries  leaving our forces overstretched  We were the ones making up the difference in paying for  to make up for shortfalls and help deter threats  I ll insist that every NATO nation must spend at least 3   You have to go up to 3   2  is the steal of the century  especially when we re paying for it  You know  we pay for them  It s just not even believable  For most NATO countries  this will represent a defense budget increase of about 30   And of course  if you take a look at their numbers  their numbers are starting to dwindle because of all the money they re spending in Ukraine  Starting on day one  I will confront the recruiting  retention  and moral when you talk about the crisis that you have  you have a morale crisis because I think it s a country crisis  I think morale is about the leader of the country  I really do  I think you can only do so much  They have to be proud of our their leader  They have to be proud of their country  They have to believe in their country  They have to believe in the American dream  or you re going to have a morale problem  And that s what you have  You have a morale problem  We will get critical race theory and left wing gender insanity out of the armed forces and totally out of the United States military   applause  and we ll take care of our amazing veterans better than anybody  In my first term  I gave the VA Choice and made it permanent  VA Choice  where you don t have a doctor  You go outside  I mean people were waiting for four months  for five months  You people probably know it  You have friends that know it very well  They go in for something that was not a big deal  and they end up being terminally ill cause they couldn t get to see a doctor  so I created and have VA Choice  They ve been wanting to do it for 57 years  I got it done  Passed in Congress  applause  And as you know  they now go in  if they can t get rapid service  we call it Rapid Service  then they go to an outside doctor  they get themselves fixed up  and we pay the bill and it s been great  It s been great  But I understand that Biden wants to terminate it  He wants to go back to the old system where you wait for nine months and then you die  It s not even believable  No  they want to terminate it  Now  after this speech  they won t  Every time I come in and say what really bad things  they end up like I said  no tax on tips  It caught on like crazy  No tax on tips  This doesn t affect you guys  You re not big for tips  okay   laughter  You don t need tips  But there are a lot of people that no tax on tips is a big deal  And I said  no tax on tips  I want two  three months  All of a sudden she s making a speech  and they were just the opposite  they were going after tip income  which is pretty hard to go after in all fairness  And she s making a speech  It goes   oh  and by the way  no tax on tips   And it didn t play well for her  But they do that now on VA Choice  You watch what s going to happen  They ll end up saying   oh  we want to keep VA Choice   But they don t  They re not competent and they don t but VA Choice has been one of the great and the others  VA Accountability  Do you know what that is  VA Accountability  The veterans had some horrible  horrible people in there  Sadists  bad people  They treated our veterans very badly because they weren t in primetime  In primetime  they wouldn t have talked to them that way  but they weren t in primetime and they were sadists and a lot of other things  Thousands  9 000 of them  And it was a shocking act of betrayal  It uh  we had to fire  we fired 9 000 people that were bad and we replaced them with good people  And then Kamala and Biden gutted those reforms after they got in  and they tried to reinstate many of the people that were fired for good reason  because they weren t treating our veterans  They were sadists  in many cases  vicious people  And then they gave them the option to come back or get a massive $200 million buyout  Can you believe this  Of people that treated our veterans badly  And I had the highest number  92  approval  from our veterans  That s the highest number by far ever  Now it s in the 40s  and it didn t take long to get there  but we had 92  approval rate from our veterans  Upon my inauguration  we will take the sadists that Kamala Harris let in and escort them from the VA hospitals and get them the hell out of our federal buildings and away from our great men and women   applause  Because those who mistreat our veterans will not be protected  They will be terminated  We re going to terminate them  We re going to get them out  Can t believe we have to do it  It s like I have to say it a second time  Under Kamala Harris  American veterans are treated worse  by far  than illegal aliens  Illegal aliens are treated you ever see them  They stay in hotels  We have veterans sleeping on the street and inside luxury hotels  you have people that came into our country  many from prisons  many from mental institutions  many terrorists  and they are treated better than our veterans  They don t care about our veterans  As borders are  Kamala has spent over one billion of taxpayer money to house illegal aliens and foreign migrants in some of the most expensive housing and hotels anywhere in the country  Meanwhile  more than 41 000 homeless American veterans are living in squalor on our streets  I mean I hope people are going to remember this because it s terrible  What s going on is terrible  You know  we become the Republican I call it the party of common sense  We want to have strong borders  We want have fair elections  Like it d be nice if somebody votes and the vote actually counts  Little things like that  But we gotta have borders  We can t let millions of people come into a country  I called it invasion  I got the wall built by using military funds  I said   our country s being invaded   and I was able to do we won 11 lawsuits  Everybody sued me  Crazy Nancy Pelosi sued me  She was always she s crazy as a bed bug  that one  She s nuts  She s a nut  But at least Joe Biden likes her a lot  No  I don t think so  Think he s angry  He fights for a year and a half in a primary system  He ends up getting 14 million votes  and they have somebody that didn t get one vote  She was let out sooner than anybody  She never made Iowa the first state  Never made it  She was the first one out of 22 people to quit  and she s now the nominee of the party  I mean  explain this  please  When I take office  I will sign an executive order to stop every penny that Harris has been spending on the shelter and transport of illegal aliens  and we will redirect that money to provide shelter and treatment for homeless American veterans   cheers and applause  And we will end very rapidly veterans homelessness in America  We had it down to a level that was the lowest In a long time  We would ve had it knocked out  but we were interrupted  As you know  Kamala s border Invasion has directly impacted thousands of National Guard families  I ll tell you what  African American families  Hispanic American families  their jobs are being taken  Unrelated to you  but their jobs are being taken  What s happening at our border  and she s in charge  and now she said   Well  I wasn t really involved too much with the border  I wasn t involved   And even better now  she s saying   Oh  well  we actually had strong borders   If they say it enough  even though we had probably 20 million people  more than 20 million people  but they figure if you say it over and over again   Our borders were strong  our borders were strong   And these are people  they re not into it  Maybe like us  maybe like me  certainly  Nobody s into it like me  I had a nice life until I did this  You know that  I had a nice  very beautiful life  but I wouldn t change it  They said   Would you have done it again   I said   Absolutely  because we re going to make America great again   We already did  and we re going to do it again   cheers and applause  Thank you  Last Thanksgiving  I visited the southern border near McAllen  Texas  where patriots of the Texas National Guard were doing the job that Harris refused to do  She refused to do it  In fact  when our guardsmen put up razor wire and boys to stop illegal crossings  Kamala and Joe Biden  Crooked Joe  sued to take those defenses down  You know that  right  How about where they say   No  no  we have a strong border   So bad  But then we find out that they flew almost a million people in over the border  They flew  That stops all of their I shouldn t say this because if there s a debate  it would be nice to surprise it with that one  They flew  They have to have an answer to everything   Well  we decided  look  they flew almost a million people into our country  Our country can t handle it  No country can handle it  Our country s going to go bankrupt  No country can handle it  They re taken over the schools  they re taken over the hospitals  they re taken over everything  and they re getting jobs that were taken by other people that are not too happy  But think of it  they flew almost a million people over everything because they were saying about how strong the border  but then they say   Well  what about the million people you flew   They have no answer for that one yet  but they ll come up with one  They always have an answer  I want to salute every Guard member who has deployed as part of Operation Lone Star to defend America from her migrant invasion  it s what it is  Including those from Texas  Florida  Georgia  Ohio  Idaho  Iowa  Oklahoma  North Dakota  South Dakota  Arkansas  Louisiana  Missouri  or as they say  Missoura sic   I love Missoura  I love that state  They do say it that way  Never quite understood that  but I say it that way because I won by 25 points  so I say it that way   applause  It s true  Utah  Tennessee  Montana  Nebraska  Indiana and New Hampshire  every one of them   applause  I want to thank them all  Thank them all  applause  And do not lose hope because a few months from now  you re once again going to have a commander in chief who defends the sovereign borders of the United States above all else  we have to  Together we ll stop the human traffickers  which are horrible  They traffic in women  mostly and children  but women  mostly  and because of the internet  it s a big business  It s big business  It s going to be bigger than the drug business  they think  The internet has caused a problem  You think of it almost as an ancient crime  Human trafficking  who would imagine  But because of the internet  it s a big business and we had it down to the smallest number in 42 years  and now they come along and it s going at a level  They stuff women into the back of cars and they stuff them into trunks and bring them around and make a lot of money  and we allow it to happen  We ll defeat the child smugglers  We ll crush the cartels  and on day one  I will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have to get the criminals from jails  They re releasing their prisoners into our country  They re releasing their guard  You gotta see MS 13  the worst gangs in the world  MS 13  they re collecting them and dropping them into the United States  I moved out thousands and thousands of them  They re moving them into the United States  They re coming back  They re taking their drug dealers  their criminals  their murderers  In Venezuela  crime is down 72  because they ve gotten their gang members  they re dropping them all into our country  many countries  And I m not just talking about South America  All over the world  they re dropping their criminals into our country  They re emptying their jails and they re emptying their prisons into our country  I mean  how stupid can we be  What are we doing  And we re going to have a crime wave  the likes of which you haven t seen  You see it every day now where a person from such and such a country is violent at levels that nobody s ever seen before  You don t have to hear it  but at levels that nobody s ever seen before  But what it is doing is it s making these countries  and I m not blaming them  if you can get away with it  I d be doing it  If I were the president of such and  I would ve done better than them  My prisons would be totally empty  They re emptying their prisons  They re taking their worst people  They re taking their real murderers  drug dealers  They re dropping them  They re taking them and busing them into the United States and dropping them  and they re saying   If you come back  we re going to kill you   And these people aren t worried about being killed  They re tough  This is a tough group of people and we ve got them  and nothing good is going to come out of that  and that includes a lot of terrorists  Your choice in this election is between a president who will always have your back and a radical liberal who will never  ever  ever have your back  whether you like it or not  In 2020  when the left wing mobs came from all over to burn our cities to the ground  Kamala stood with the looters and rioters and raised money to bail out violent criminals all over the jails of Minnesota  She came with money to bail them out  Kamala s running mate  his nickname is Tampon Tim  but I wouldn t say that because this group is a little more low key than the ones I m used to speaking before   laughter  Tampon Tim Walz  he wants think of this  He signed a bill mandating that every boy s bathroom has tampons in it  I don t think that s good  It s not good  He ignored the pleas of the mayor and the police chief to deploy the National Guard in Minneapolis and said   You re not highly trained soldiers  You re 19 year olds who cook   That s what he said   You re 19 year olds who cook   That s a pretty famous statement  As president  I stood with the National Guard as you saved Minneapolis  saved Kenosha and saved Washington DC  I saved them  If I didn t override what they wanted to do and what tradition is  those places would ve been we would ve lost every monument in Washington  They came into Washington and they were very rambunctious  They liked to pull the statues down  some of these beautiful statues  and then they hit Abraham Lincoln  I said   All right  that s the end of that   And I found there was a bill from the early 1900s  we don t do bills like that anymore  they said   If you touch government property  statues  monuments of any kind  you ll serve 10 years with no probation  no early getting out  You go to jail for 10 years   Very simple  It was beautifully stated  It was like one paragraph and it had dust on it  it was dusty  Nobody used it because we wouldn t do that because we become very soft  They only go after political opponents  They don t do anything like murderers  those guys are safe  Drug dealers  no problem  But political opponents they go after  So this was in very bad  It was a very old bill and I had a news conference and they were all over it  They wanted to take down the Thomas Jefferson  the Jefferson Memorial  They wanted to take it down  They were heading that way  They were actually heading that way  We had them all stopped  but they were heading that way  It s like fighting a war  And I went out to a news conference  They announced   Anybody that touches any of our monuments or statues goes to jail for 10 years   Everybody left Washington DC  I was very lonely  They all left  I watched them  I watched their asses from the back   laughter  That s all I could see is thousands of asses  And that stopped  We got it stopped  We got it stopped quickly  They all left immediately  and they haven t come back  Although  the other day you see them starting to do it again  They re taking the spray paint and they re spraying those gorgeous limestone tigers and all the different things  When you spray limestone  you ll see it in 100 years from now because it s a very porous stone  and they were spraying the hell out of it  and they were burning the American flag  I want to get a law passed  Everyone tells me   Oh  sir  it s very hard   You burn an American flag  you go to jail for one year  Gotta do it   applause  We gotta do it  They say it s not constitutional  They say   Sir  that s not constitutional   We ll make it constitutional  We re going to make it constitutional  but you burn an American flag  you go to jail for one year  That was terrible  what happened at the convention in Chicago  They re burning American flags all over the place and the fake news doesn t want to show it  I will proudly stand with you in defense of law and order  and we re going to have four great years in the White House  We re going to make our country very special again  I know your commitment  I know your character in conclusion  and I know your courage  As president  I saw it every year during natural disaster  national emergency  and just a few weeks ago  we saw it in the moments after an evil assassin tried to take my life  That sucker was moving fast  I say   Wow  glad I got down quick  quickly   But it was uh quite a time  It was quite a thing  Who would think  But that day  a member of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard was in the second row watching as the bullets flew when the shots rang out and hit a great patriot  Cory  We know now Cory by his first name  Cory  the Pennsylvania Guardsman  did not shy away  He did not run for cover  He ran toward the gunshots  took off his tie to use as a tourniquet and cradled Cory s head in his hands  and it was a tough scene  Cory died  as you know  Two other people were hit very badly  were supposed to die  and the doctors up there did a phenomenal job  They re living and they re doing okay  and although he tragically could not revive Cory  he did what every Guardsman here would have done  and it was a tough  it was a tough thing he did  to be honest  I saw that  It was a tough thing he did  Tremendous courage  Not only the bullets  I mean  just the fact he was holding this guy who really got hit  He really got hit  but he gave his all and he was very proud to do it  America s blessed to have such extraordinary patriots  as are all of the people in this room  You put your service above yourself  and when our country needs you  you always answer the call  I know that very much  I know the people here  That s the spirit of duty and loyalty that defines the men and women of the National Guard  and it s the spirit that is going to save our country because our country needs saving  With your support in this election  we will reclaim our sovereignty  We will rebuild our military  We will support our police  We will stop migrant crime  which is at levels that nobody can even imagine  We will restore our economy  We ll get rid of inflation  We will protect our second amendment  We will lift up our cities  we will secure our rights  and we will defend our freedoms like we have never defended our freedoms before and we will fight  fight  fight for America   cheers and applause  Thank you  Thank you very much  Thank you very much  So just in closing  you ve never let me down  never  You ve always been there for me when we had emergencies  when we had a crisis  and I m going to always be there for you and I can promise you this  together we will make America great again  Thank you  God bless you all   cheers and applause  Thank you very much  God bless you all  Thank you  Thank you  man  Thank you

Thank you  Thank   thank you   Applause   Thank you  Thank you  everyone  Thank you   Applause   Thank you  Thank you   Applause   Audience  USA  USA  USA  The Vice President  Thank you all  Audience  USA  USA  USA  The Vice President  Thank you all   Applause   Okay  we ve got to get to some business  We ve got to get to some business  Okay  Thank you all   Applause   Okay   Laughs   Thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you   Applause   Thank you  thank you  Please  Thank you   Applause   Please  Thank you so very much  Thank you  everyone  Thank you  everyone  Thank you   Applause   Okay  let s get to business  Let s get to business  All right   Laughs    Applause   So  let me start by thanking my most incredible husband  Doug    applause    for being an incredible partner to me  an incredible father to Cole and Ella  And happy anniversary  Dougie   Laughs    Applause   I love you so very much  To our president  Joe Biden    applause    when I think about the path that we have traveled together  Joe  I am filled with gratitude  Your record is extraordinary  as history will show  and your character is inspiring  And Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you both   Applause   And to Coach Tim Walz    applause    you are going to be an incredible vice president   Applause   And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign  your support is humbling  So  America  the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected  but I m no stranger to unlikely journeys  So  my mother  our mother  Shyamala Harris  had one of her own  And I miss her every day and especially right now  And I know she s looking down smiling   Applause   I know that  So  my mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone  traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer   Applause   When she finished school  she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage  but as fate would have it  she met my father  Donald Harris  a student from Jamaica   Applause   They   they fell in love and got married  and that act of self determination made my sister Maya and me   Applause   Growing up  we moved a lot  I will always remember that big Mayflower truck packed with all our belongings  ready to go to Illinois  to Wisconsin    applause   and wherever our parents  jobs took us  My early memories of our parents together are very joyful ones  a home filled with laughter and music   Aretha  Coltrane  and Miles  At the park  my mother would say   Stay close   But my father would say  as he smiled   Run  Kamala  run  Don t be afraid  Don t let anything stop you    Applause   From my earliest years  he taught me to be fearless  But the harmony between my parents did not last  When I was in elementary school  they split up  and it was mostly my mother who raised us  Before she could finally afford to buy a home  she rented a small apartment in the East Bay  In the bay    applause    in the Bay  you either live in the Hills or the Flatlands  We lived in the Flats  a beautiful working class neighborhood of firefighters  nurses  and construction workers    applause    all who tended their lawns with pride  My mother  she worked long hours  And like many working parents  she leaned on a trusted circle to help raise us  Mrs  Shelton  who ran the daycare below us and became a second mother  Uncle Sherman  Aunt Mary  Uncle Freddy  Auntie Kris  None of them family by blood and all of them family by love   Applause   Family who taught us how to make gumbo  how to play chess   and sometimes even let us win  Family who loved us  believed in us  and told us we could be anything and do anything   Applause   They instilled in us the values they personified  community  faith  and the importance of treating others as you would want to be treated   with kindness  respect  and compassion   Applause   My mother was a brilliant  five foot tall brown woman with an accent   Applause   And as the eldest child   as the eldest child  I saw how the world would sometimes treat her  But my mother never lost her cool  She was tough  courageous  a trailblazer in the fight for women s health  And she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night  She taught us to never complain about injustice  but do something about it  Do something about it   Applause   That was my mother  And she taught us   and she always   she also taught us   and she also taught us  and never do anything half assed    Applause   And that is a direct quote    laughs    a direct quote  I grew up immersed in the ideals of the Civil Rights Movement  My parents had met at a civil rights gathering  And they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders  including the lawyers  like Thurgood Marshall and C    Constance Baker Motley   those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America  So  at a young age  I decided I wanted to do that work  I wanted to be a lawyer  And when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue  I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life  You see  when I was in high school  I started to notice something about my best friend  Wanda  She was sad at school  and there were times she didn t want to go home  So  one day  I asked if everything was all right  and she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather  And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us  and she did   Applause   This is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor   to protect people like Wanda   because I believe everyone has a right to safety  to dignity  and to justice   Applause   As a prosecutor  when I had a case  I charged it not in the name of the victim but in the name of the people for a simple reason  In our system of justice  a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us   Applause   And I would often explain this to console survivors of crime  to remind them no one should be made to fight alone  We are all in this together   Applause   And every day in the courtroom  I stood proudly before a judge and I said five words   Kamala Harris  for the people    Applause   And to be clear   and to be clear  my entire career  I ve only had one client  the people   Applause   And so  on behalf of the people  on behalf of every American  regardless of party  race  gender  or the language your grandmother speaks  on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey  on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with   people who work hard  chase their dreams  and look out for one another  on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth  I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America   Applause   And with this election   and    laughs    and with this election  our nation   our nation  with this election  has a precious  fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness  cynicism  and divisive battles of the past  a chance to chart a new way forward    applause    not   not as members of any one party or faction but as Americans   Applause   And let me say  I know there are people of various political views watching tonight  and I want you to know I promise to be a president for all Americans   Applause   You can always trust me to put country above party and self  to hold sacred America s fundamental principles  from the rule of law to free and fair elections to the peaceful transfer of power   Applause   I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations  A president who leads and listens  who is realistic  practical  and has common sense  and always fights for the American people   Applause   From the courthouse to the White House  that has been my life s work   Applause   As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland  California    applause    I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them  As attorney general of California  I took on the big banks    applause    delivered $20 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights  one of the first of its kind in the nation   Applause   I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for profit colleges    applause    for workers who were being cheated out of their wages  the wages they were due    applause    for seniors facing elder abuse  I fought against the cartels who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings    applause    who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities  And I will tell you  these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices  We were underestimated at practically every turn  but we never gave up  because the future is always worth fighting for   Applause   And that s the fight we are in right now  a fight for America s future   Applause   Fellow Americans  this election is not only the most important of our lives  it is one of the most important in the life of our nation   Applause   In many ways  Donald Trump is an unserious man   Laughter   But the consequences   but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious   Applause   Consider   consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election  Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes  When he failed  he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol  where they assaulted law enforcement officers  When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help  he did the opposite  He fanned the flames  And now  for an entirely different set of crimes  he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans    applause    and separately   and separately found liable for committing sexual abuse  And consider   consider what he intends to do if we give him power again  Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol  his explicit intent to jail journalists  political opponents  and anyone he sees as the enemy  his explicit intent to deploy our active duty military against our own citizens  Audience  Booo    The Vice President  Consider   consider the power he will have  especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution  Audience  Booo    The Vice President  Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails  Audience  Booo    The Vice President  And how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States not to improve your life  not to strengthen our national security  but to serve the only client he has ever had  himself   Applause   And we know   and we know what a second Trump term would look like  It s all laid out in Project 2025  written by his closest advisers  And its sum total is to pull our country back to the past  But  America    Audience  We are not going back  The Vice President    we are not going back   Applause   We are not going back  We are not going back  Audience  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  The Vice President  We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare  We are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act  when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions  We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools   Applause   We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and childcare for our children   Applause   America  we are not going back  Audience  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  The Vice President  And we are charting   and we are charting a new way forward    applause    forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class  because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to America s success  And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency   Applause   And I ll tell you  this is personal for me  The middle class is where I come from  My mother kept a strict budget  We lived within our means  yet we wanted for little  And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them  because  as she taught us  opportunity is not available to everyone  That s why we will create what I call an opportunity economy   an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed    applause    whether you live in a rural area  small town  or big city  And as president  I will bring together labor and workers    applause    and small business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs  to grow our economy  and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries  We will provide access to capital for small business owners and entrepreneurs and founders   Applause   And we will end America s housing shortage    applause    and protect Social Security and Medicare   Applause   Now compare that to Donald Trump  because I think everyone here knows he doesn t actually fight for the middle class  Not   he doesn t actually fight for the middle class  Instead  he fights for himself and his billionaire friends  And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add    Audience  Booo    The Vice President    up to $5 trillion to the national debt  Audience  Booo    The Vice President  And all the while  he intends to enact what in effect is a national sales tax   call it a  Trump tax    that would raise prices on middle class families by almost $4 000 a year  Audience  Booo    The Vice President  Well  instead of a Trump tax hike  we will pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans   Applause   Friends  I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives  especially on matters of heart and home   Applause   But tonight  in America  too many women are not able to make those decisions  And let s be clear about how we got here  Donald Trump handpicked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom  Audience  Booo    The Vice President  And now he brags about it  In his words  quote   I did it  and I m proud to have done it   End quote  Audience  Booo    The Vice President  Well  I ll tell you  over the past two years  I ve traveled across our country  and women have told me their stories  Husbands and fathers have shared theirs  Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot  developing sepsis  losing the ability to ever again have children  all because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients  Couples just trying to grow their family  cut off in the middle of IVF treatments  Children who have survived sexual assault potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term  This is what s happening in our country because of Donald Trump  And understand  he is not done  As a part of his agenda  he and his allies would limit access to birth control  ban medication abortion  and enact a nationwide abortion ban  with or without Congress  Audience  Booo    And get this  Get this  He plans to create a national anti abortion coordinator and force states to report on women s miscarriages and abortions  Audience  Booo    The Vice President  Simply put  they are out of their minds   Applause   And one must ask   one must ask  Why exactly is it that they don t trust women  Well  we trust women  We trust women   Applause   And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom  as president of the United States  I will proudly sign it into law   Applause   In this election  many other fundamental freedoms are at stake  the freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools  communities  and places of worship  the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride    applause   the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis    applause   and the freedom that unlocks all the others  the freedom to vote   Applause   With this election  we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act   Applause   And let me be clear  And let me be clear  After decades in law enforcement  I know the importance of safety and security  especially at our border  Last year  Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades  The Border Patrol endorsed it  But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign  so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal  Audience  Booo    The Vice President  Well  I refuse to play politics with our security  and here is my pledge to you  As president  I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed  and I will sign it into law   Applause   I know   I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system   Applause   We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border   Applause   And  America  we must also be steadfast in advancing our security and values abroad  As vice president  I have confronted threats to our security  negotiated with foreign leaders  strengthened our alliances  and engaged with our brave troops overseas   Applause   As commander in chief  I will ensure America always has the strongest  most lethal fighting force in the world   Applause   And I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families  and I will always honor and never disparage their service and their sacrifice   Applause   Audience  USA  USA  USA  The Vice President  I will make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and artificial intelligence  that America  not China  wins the competition for the 21st century  and that we strengthen  not abdicate  our global leadership  Trump  on the other hand  threatened to abandon NATO  He encouraged Putin to invade our allies  Said Russia could  quote   do whatever the hell they want   Audience  Booo    The Vice President  Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine  I met with President Zelenskyy to warn him about Russia s plan to invade  I helped mobilize a global response   over 50 countries   to defend against Putin s aggression   Applause   And as president  I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO Allies   Applause   With respect to the war in Gaza  President Biden and I are working around the clock  because now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done   Applause   And let me be clear  And let me be clear  I will always stand up for Israel s right to defend itself    applause    and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself  because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7    applause    including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival  At the same time  what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating  So many innocent lives lost   Applause   Desperate  hungry people fleeing for safety  over and over again  The scale of suffering is heartbreaking  President Biden and I are working to end this war  such that Israel is secure  the hostages are released  the suffering in Gaza ends  and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity  security  freedom  and self determination   Applause   And know this  I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran backed terrorists  I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un  who are rooting for Trump   who are rooting for Trump   Applause   Because  you know  they know   they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors  They know Trump won t hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself   Applause   And as president  I will never waver in defense of America s security and ideals  because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny  I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs   Applause   Audience  USA  USA  USA  The Vice President  So  fellow Americans   fellow Americans  I   I love our country with all my heart   Applause   Everywhere I go   everywhere I go  in everyone I meet  I see a nation that is ready to move forward  ready for the next step in the incredible journey that is America  I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation and inspired the world   that here  in this country  anything is possible  that nothing is out of reach  An America where we care for one another  look out for one another  and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us   Applause   That none of us   none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed   Applause   And that in unity  there is strength  You know  our opponents in this race are out there every day denigrating America  talking about how terrible everything is  Well  my mother had another lesson she used to teach  Never let anyone tell you who you are  you show them who you are   Applause   America  let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for  freedom  opportunity  compassion  dignity  fairness  and endless possibilities   Applause   We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world  And on behalf of our children and our grandchildren and all those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty  we must be worthy of this moment  It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done  guided by optimism and faith  to fight for this country we love  to fight for the ideals we cherish  and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth   the privilege and pride of being an American   Applause   So  let s get out there  let s fight for it  Let s get out there  let s vote for it  And together  let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told   Applause   Thank you

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373852",9552,"Wow  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Wow  Thank you  Thank you  first of all  to Vice President Harris  Thanks for putting your trust in me  and for inviting me to be part of this incredible campaign  And a thank you to President Joe Biden  for four years of strong  historic leadership  It s the honor of my life to accept your nomination for vice president of the United States  We re all here tonight for one beautiful  simple reason  We love this country  So thank you  to all of you here in Chicago  and all of you watching at home tonight  Thank you for your passion  Thank you for your determination  And most of all  thank you for bringing the joy to this fight  Now I grew up in Butte  Nebraska  a town of 400 people  I had 24 kids in my high school class  And none of them went to Yale  But I ll tell you what  Growing up in a small town like that  you learn how to take care of each other  That family down the road  they may not think like you do  they may not pray like you do  They may not love like you do  But they re your neighbors  And you look out for them  And they look out for you  Everybody belongs  And everybody has a responsibility to contribute  For me  it was serving in the Army National Guard  I joined up two days after my 17th birthday  and I proudly wore our nation s uniform for 24 years  My dad  a Korean War era Army veteran  died of lung cancer a couple of years later  He left behind a mountain of medical debt  Thank god for Social Security survivor benefits  And thank God for the G I  Bill that allowed my dad and me to go to college  And millions of other Americans  Eventually  like the rest of my family  I fell in love with teaching  Three out of four of us married teachers  I wound up teaching social studies and coaching football at Mankato West High School  Go  Scarlets  We ran   we ran a 44 defense  we played through to the whistle on every single play  and we even won a state championship  Never close the yearbook  people  But it was those players and my students who inspired me to run for Congress  They saw in me what I had hoped to instill in them  a commitment to the common good  an understanding that we re all in this together  and the belief that a single person can make a real difference for their neighbors  So there I was  a 40 something high school teacher with little kids  zero political experience and no money  running in a deep red district  But you know what  Never underestimate a public school teacher  Never  I represented my neighbors in Congress for 12 years  And I learned an awful lot  I learned how to work across the aisle on issues like growing the rural economies and taking care of veterans  And I learned how to compromise without compromising my values  Then I came back to serve as governor  and we got right to work making a difference in our neighbors  lives  We cut taxes for the middle class  We passed paid family and medical leave  We invested in fighting crime and affordable housing  We cut the cost of prescription drugs and helped people escape the kind of medical debt that nearly sank my family  And we made sure that every kid in our state gets breakfast and lunch every day  So while other states were banning books from their schools  we were banishing hunger from ours  We also protected reproductive freedom  because in Minnesota  we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make  And even if we wouldn t make those same choices for ourselves  we ve got a golden rule  Mind your own damn business  And that includes I V F  and fertility treatments  And this is personal for Gwen and I  If you ve never experienced the hell that is infertility  I guarantee you  you know somebody who has  I can remember praying each night for a phone call  The pit in your stomach when the phone would ring  and the absolute agony when we heard the treatments hadn t worked  It took Gwen and I years  but we had access to fertility treatments  And when our daughter was born  we named her Hope  Hope  Gus and Gwen  you are my entire world  and I love you  I m letting you in on how we started a family because this is a big part about what this election is about  Freedom  When Republicans use the word freedom  they mean that the government should be free to invade your doctor s office  Corporations   free to pollute your air and water  And banks   free to take advantage of customers  But when we Democrats talk about freedom  we mean the freedom to make a better life for yourself and the people that you love  Freedom to make your own health care decisions  And yeah  your kids  freedom to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in the hall  Look  I know guns  I m a veteran  I m a hunter  And I was a better shot than most Republicans in Congress  and I ve got the trophies to prove it  But I m also a dad  I believe in the Second Amendment  but I also believe our first responsibility is to keep our kids safe  That s what this is all about  The responsibility we have to our kids  to each other and to the future that we re building together  in which everyone is free to build the kind of life they want  But not everyone has that same sense of responsibility  Some folks just don t understand what it takes to be a good neighbor  Take Donald Trump and JD Vance  Their Project 2025 will make things much  much harder for people who are just trying to live their lives  They spend a lot of time pretending they know nothing about this  But look  I coached high school football long enough to know  and trust me on this  When somebody takes the time to draw up a playbook  they re going to use it  And we know  if these guys get back in the White House  they ll start jacking up the costs on the middle class  They ll repeal the Affordable Care Act  They ll gut Social Security and Medicare  And they will ban abortion across this country  with or without Congress  Here s the thing  It s an agenda nobody asked for  It s an agenda that serves nobody  except the richest and the most extreme amongst us  And it s an agenda that does nothing for our neighbors in need  Is it weird  Absolutely  Absolutely  But it s also wrong  and it s dangerous  It s not just me saying so  it s Trump s own people  They were with him for four years  They re warning us that the next four years will be much  much worse  You know  when I was teaching  every year we d elect a student body president  And you know what  Those teenagers could teach Donald Trump a hell of a lot about what a leader is  Leaders don t spend all day insulting people and blaming others  Leaders do the work  So I don t know about you  I m ready to turn the page on these guys  So  go ahead  Say it with me  We re not going back   Crowd chants   We re not going back    We ve got something better to offer the American people  It starts with our candidate  Kamala Harris  From her first day   as a prosecutor  as a district attorney  as an attorney general  as a United States senator  and then our vice president   she s fought on the side of the American people  She s taken on the predators and fraudsters  She s taken down the transnational gangs  And she s stood up to powerful corporate interests  She has never hesitated to reach across that aisle if it meant improving your lives  And she s always done it with energy  with passion and with joy  Folks  we ve got a chance to make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States  But I think we owe it to the American people to tell them exactly what she d do as president before we ask them for their votes  So this is the part   clip and save it  and send it to your undecided relatives so they know  If you re a middle class family  or trying to get into the middle class  Kamala Harris is going to cut your taxes  If you re getting squeezed by prescription drug prices  Kamala Harris is going to take on Big Pharma  If you re hoping to buy a home  Kamala Harris is going to help make it more affordable  And no matter who you are  Kamala Harris is going to stand up and fight for your freedom to live the life that you want to lead  because that s what we want for ourselves  and it s what we want for our neighbors  You know  you might not know it  but I haven t given a lot of big speeches like this  But I have given a lot of pep talks  So let me finish with this  team  It s the fourth quarter  We re down a field goal  But we re on offense and we ve got the ball  We re driving down the field  And boy  do we have the right team  Kamala Harris is tough  Kamala Harris is experienced  And Kamala Harris is ready  Our job  our job  our job  our job for everyone watching  is to get in the trenches and do the blocking and tackling  One inch at a time  One yard at a time  One phone call at a time  One door knock at a time  One $5 donation at a time  Look  we ve got 76 days  That s nothing  There ll be time to sleep when you re dead  We re going to leave it on the field  That s how we ll keep moving forward  That s how we ll turn the page on Donald Trump  That s how we ll build a country where workers come first  health care and housing are human rights  and the government stays the hell out of your bedroom  That s how we make America a place where no child is left hungry  Where no community is left behind  Where nobody gets told they don t belong  That s how we re going to fight  And as the next president of the United States always says  when we fight    Crowd chants   We win    When we fight    Crowd chants   We win    When we fight    Crowd chants   We win    Thank you  God bless ","","",""

not just about us versus Donald Trump  This is not just about us versus Donald Trump  This is about two very different visions for our nation  One  ours  focused on the future  the other focused on the past  And  Wisconsin  we fight for the future   Applause   We fight for the future  We believe in the future    a future with affordable health care  a future with affordable childcare  a future with affordable housing and paid leave  That s the future we believe in   Applause   We believe in a future where we build an opportunity economy  where every American has the opportunity to own a home  start a business  and build wealth  including intergenerational wealth  That s what we believe in   Applause   We believe in the future of our country  We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America s families  And when I am president  I will bring down the cost of groceries by making sure markets are competitive and fair   Applause   Together with Coach  we will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription medication for all Americans   Applause   We will take on the high cost of housing  understanding so many people are trying to fulfill the American dream and we need to give people help to get there   Applause   In fact  last week  I announced my plan to build millions of new homes and help first time homebuyers with a down payment     applause     knowing that s a step to get where we need to go  And my tax plan will give 100 million more Americans a tax cut  including $6 000 to families during the first year of a child s life   Applause   That s about help with a car seat  with a crib  with diapers  with baby clothes  If we care about children  then let s help people    help people     applause     do what they naturally want to do but don t always have the resources to do it  And unlike Donald Trump  I will always put the middle class and working families first   Applause   But now we know he has a different plan    Trump  Right  Just look at Project 2025  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Now  if he is elected  understand what that    you know  by the way  can you believe they put that thing in writing  right  So  that plan  though  tells us what they re up to  Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And he wants to impose what is  in effect  a national sales tax  which will cost a typical family $3 900 a year  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Understand that  And on top of all of this  he intends to end the Affordable Care Act  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And you remember what that was like  when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions  Do you remember what that was  Breast cancer survivors  children with diabetes  grandparents who need help and support being denied care  We re not going back   Applause   AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We are not going back  We are not going back  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We will move forward  Just like Wisconsin s state motto tells us  Forward   Applause   Forward  Ours is a fight for the future  and it is a fight for freedom   Applause   And it is a fight for freedom  like the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do   Applause   You know  I don t know what s up with these people  by the way  I mean  they just seemingly don t trust women  Well  we trust women   Applause   We trust women  And we know how we got to this place  We know how we got to this place  with now over 20    over 20 Trump abortion bans  We know how we got here  The former president  Trump  hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT     with the intention    with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v  Wade  And as he intended  they did  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And then  in state after state  they proposed and passed laws to punish women  criminalize health care providers    in some states  not even making an exception for rape or incest  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And just yesterday  when he was asked if he has any regrets about ending Roe v  Wade  Donald Trump    Donald Trump  without even a moment s hesitation    you would think you would reflect on it for a second     laughter     said no   No regrets   AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  And that s because    I do believe  you know  bad behavior should result in a consequence   Applause   Well  we will make sure he does face a consequence  and that will be at the ballot box in November     applause     in November    in November  And I promise you  when I am president of the United States and Congress passes a bill     applause     to restore the protections of Roe v  Wade  I will proudly sign it into law   Applause   And  Wisconsin  in addition to that  as you all know  we are witnessing across our nation a full on attack on hard fought  hard won  fundamental freedoms and rights    across our nation    like the freedom to vote     applause   the freedom to be safe from gun violence     applause   the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride   Applause   So  we know what we re dealing with in this moment  And we must remember  As the generations of Americans before us who led the fight for freedom  the baton is now in our hands   Applause   We carry the baton  We carry the baton  And so much is on the line in this election  And understand    we have to understand something  This is not 2016 or 2020  This is not 2016 or 2020  And  in particular  the stakes are higher for a lot of reasons  because we know what he does when he s in office  but including that  last month  the Supreme Court of the United States basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune    AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT     for what he does in the White House  Now  think about what that means  Think about what that means  knowing the individual we re talking about  Donald Trump has openly vowed to be a dictator on day one  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  He has openly indicated his intention to weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies  AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  Think about what we know about him and what he s told us  He even called for  quote    quote   the termination of the Constitution of the United States   AUDIENCE  Booo    THE VICE PRESIDENT  So  let us be very clear  Somebody who intends to terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have the opportunity to stand behind the seal of the President of the United States   Applause   Never again  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We re not going back  We re not going back  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re going forward  AUDIENCE  We re not going back  We re not going back  We re not going back  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We re not going back  We re not going back  So    Tim just looked at me and said   We re not going back  I think    Laughter   So  Milwaukee  here s the thing  as you all know  It s why you are here  It s why you have taken the time to be here this evening  It all comes down    AUDIENCE MEMBER  Kamala  I love you  THE VICE PRESIDENT  I love you back  And it all comes down to this   Applause   We re here    thank you  But  yeah    thank you   Applause   But here s the thing  Here s the thing  The reason that we are all here together  spending this time together  truly and deeply  is because we love our country  We love    we love our country   Applause   We believe in our country   Applause   AUDIENCE  USA  USA  USA  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We believe in our country  AUDIENCE  USA  USA  USA  THE VICE PRESIDENT  That s right  And I do believe    I do believe that it is the highest form of patriotism    the highest form of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country  And that s what we are here to do   Applause   And that    and that    and that is how we fulfill the promise of America     applause     the promise of America  And it is that promise of America    AUDIENCE MEMBER  Medical  THE VICE PRESIDENT  We need a medical assistant here  Okay  We need a nurse  We need a medic here  please  Let s just make a    let s make a path  Let s make a path  if you all don t mind  Just let s make a path to right here  Let s just create a path to right here  Let s create a path   Applause   Let s create a path  guys  And thanks for looking out each other    look out for each other  But let s    let s create a path for the medics  Okay   Applause   Okay   Applause   You okay  Okay  Okay  Okay  We re going to be okay  We re going to be okay  All right   Applause   Okay  We re going to be okay  This is who we are  right  This is what we re about  looking out for each other  The thing    we care about each other   Applause   You know  it s about truly understanding what  love thy neighbor  means   Applause   It s about  in the face of a perfect stranger  seeing a neighbor  understanding what that love of each other means   Applause   It s a big difference between what we re talking about and what s on the other side  So  listen  I ll just    I ll end with this point  the promise of America  The promise of America is what we are fighting for  and it is that promise that I think makes it possible that Coach Governor Walz and I would be sharing the same ticket  Think about that   Applause   Think about that  Think about it in the context of the promise of America  Two middle class kids  One born in Oakland  California  to a working mom  The other  a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm   Applause   I worked at a McDonald s   Laughter and applause   But only in America    only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House   Applause   Only in America  Only in America   Applause   So  my last point is this  In this election  we each face a question  And that question is  What kind of country do we want to live in  Right  Do we want to live in a country of chaos and fear and hate    AUDIENCE  No  THE VICE PRESIDENT     no    or a country of freedom  compassion  and rule of law   Applause   And the beauty    the beauty of our democracy    listen  the beauty of our democracy is we each have the power to answer that question  Each and every one of us has the power to answer that question   Applause   Each one of us  That s our power  The power is with the people   Applause   So  Wisconsin  today  I ask  Are you ready to have your voices heard   Applause   Do we believe in freedom   Applause   Do we believe in opportunity   Applause   Do we believe in the promise of America   Applause   And are we ready to fight for it   Applause   And when we fight    AUDIENCE  We win  THE VICE PRESIDENT     we win  God bless you  And God bless the United States of America  God bless you   Applause

who is polling beautifully  I think  Paul  good luck  Good luck  Paul  You re going to do it  And Michigan House Republican leader  Matt Hall   cheers  Matt  thanks  Oh  thanks Matt  Great  You look the role  Matt  Beautiful  Thank you very much  Matt  CROWD MEMBER   inaudible  TRUMP   laughter  You re right  That ll be next  Thank you very much  Michigan Senate Republican leader  Aric Nesbitt   applause  Aric  Thank you  Aric  Nice seeing you again  Doing a good job  We re here today to talk about how we are going to stop the Kamala crime wave that is going on at levels that nobody s ever seen before  And she is  as you know  the most radical left person ever even thought of for high office  certainly for the office of president  People don t know the real Kamala  but I do  And people that do what I do  they also know  But she is so far left that nobody can even imagine and her real thoughts are there  You know she s changing they call her a flip flopper at the highest level that they ve ever seen in politics because she s come out with policy for years  defund the police  You don t mind defunding  do you fellas   looks towards police officers  Would you vote for a defunder   booing  Would you vote by the way  the people that you protect don t want defunders either  but she s been that until just recently  but she s always been for defunding the police  And the person that she s running with  Tim Walz  is equally far left  This is the most far left group  Nobody s ever seen anything like it  and the press is giving them a free pass  And you re not going to have if it was up to them  you wouldn t even have the men behind me  people behind me  representatives behind me  You wouldn t have them  They wouldn t have a job  They think it s going to just police itself  Everything s going to take care of itself  Her father is  as you know  a Marxist professor  and he obviously did a good job  but this is where she s coming from  And you see her now with a smile  and she s gotten rid of the laugh over the last couple of days  I don t know  I haven t seen her laugh   laughter  They ve told her   Don t laugh  please    laughter  But I ll bet inside she was laughing last night when she saw the way Joe Biden left because that was a coup  That was a coup  And I m no fan of his at all  And it started with the debate  and from that point on  it just got worse and worse  But that was a coup  It was a vicious  violent overthrow of a president of the United States  Since Comrade Kamala Harris took office  uh her administration s crime statistics show she s presided over a 43  increase in violent crime  These are all government numbers  43  increase in violent crime  I ll bet the people behind me don t have anything like that  It just gets better  It doesn t get worse  Including a 58  increase in rape  89  increase in aggravated assault and a 56  increase in robbery  The crime in America  the fact is is out of control  I watched last night in amazement as they tried to pretend that everything was great  the crime was great  the border was great  there wasn t a problem at all  No inflation  no nothing  There has been a report that the job numbers over the last period of time were fraudulent  And they I understand that because I know how the job numbers go  And you want to be a bad person in high office you can be a bad person  but the numbers are going to be revised that the job numbers were far less at nobody s ever seen  600 000 to a million people jobs less  And let s see if that turns out to be true  but that s what the rumor is  It was reported by a very respected outfit  group  and we ll see what happens  But that s a terrible insult to our economy because we were seeing numbers that were okay  not great  but now we re seeing numbers that when they re adjusted are a disaster  But crime in America is out of control  I m going to make it  along with the economy  inflation  strong borders and energy dominance  my top priority  I m including crime in America  Normally  that s done locally  And uh we re going to give the local people a lot of help  like I did initially  but not that much  We had a lot of great numbers coming out when I was president  Now  we re seeing numbers that are just absolutely horrific  The Democrats are holding their convention in Chicago in order to showcase it  And yet  as you know  on 4th of July weekend  117 people were shot  Of the 117  17 were killed  This is 4th of July weekend  And 40 were shot last weekend  I don t know how many were killed  but assume a lot  And that s a war zone that s worse than Afghanistan that we read about all the time  Speaking of Afghanistan  the worst and most embarrassing day in the history of our country  in my opinion  we left 13 dead soldiers  47 obliterated  just obliterated the arms  the legs to face  left people behind  and we left $85 billion worth of equipment behind for the Taliban to use as it sees fit  And they re selling a lot of it because they don t need 700 000 guns and rifles  They don t need 72 000 armor plated vehicles  They re one of the largest sellers of military equipment in the world right now  They re selling our equipment because they said  by the way  would ve never happened with me  Abdul would never have done that  but they said we didn t have anybody shot  After my conversations with the leader of the Taliban  uh zero shot in 18 months  We had nobody lost in 18 months  He knew that he was not going to do that  I knew that  But now you look at what s happened and it s back  we would ve kept Bagram  That s the big air base  not because of Afghanistan  but because it s located one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons  So it s one hour away and we had it one of the biggest air bases in the world  We built it for billions and billions of dollars many years ago  Got the biggest runways  the biggest everything  and we just walked away from it  gave it to them  and now China s occupying it  and I thought that the scene a few days ago of the third anniversary  they call it the Defeat of America  was one of the ugliest scenes that I ve seen on television in a long time  I ve seen some pretty bad ones  So have you  we re witnessing some pretty bad ones  Uh they had a parade where the parade was uh all of our equipment  a lot of our equipment  brand new beautiful armor plated trucks coming down a road and people cheering  Not that many people cheering actually  but there were people cheering  but they were making us look very bad  We have a fool  a fool as a president  They lied last night about things that nobody s ever seen  They lied about soldiers at a grave site  They lied about Charlottesville  they lied about uh inflation  The inflation s been absolutely horrible  absolutely horrible  and everyone knows that we had virtually no inflation  They had 9   but that wasn t including some of the things that went up more than anything else  They gave themselves a pass  But mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime free America  We want a crime free America  We re going to stop violent crime in the United States  and it s people like this that can do the job better than anybody  They do the job justly and fairly  but there s nobody like these people   cheers and applause  Thank you  Thank you  There s nobody like them  so they can do it  They have to be given back their rights and their dignity  They have to be allowed to do their job  We re going to be uh guaranteeing immunities  and I m not looking necessarily uh just here  but we have police in various areas that are pretty rough areas  If they do their job  if they re diligent in doing their job  they go after the police officer rather than the criminal  They lose their house  they lose their pension  they lose their family  they lose everything  They lose everything  Then we re going to make sure that doesn t happen  Over the past four years  the Marxist left has waged a vicious war on law enforcement in our country  They ve taken away the dignity and the spirit and the life of some of these police officers  and that s why you see it  The crime is so out of control in our country  I mean  you have cities  I will say this  the top 25 almost all are run by Democrats and they have very similar policies  It s just insane  But you can t walk across the street to get a loaf of bread  You get shot  you get mugged  you get raped  you get whatever it may be  and you ve seen it and I ve seen it  and it s time for a change  We have to bring back our cities  We have these cities that are great cities where people are afraid to live in America  They re fleeing the cities of our country  What we would consider  what we did consider  you know interestingly like New York when I left for Washington  New York was we had a very bad Mayor de Blasio  but he wasn t there that long and he couldn t ruin what took place  But uh we had a city that was so wonderful and so thriving  and just in a few short years that changed  New York state is doing terribly  I heard the governor last night speaking so viciously and violently about me  but she doesn t speak about what they ve done to destroy the state  The law enforcement has been decimated  The judges  what s gone on with the judges in New York  Nobody there s no justice  We re not getting justice in New York  And yet she speaks so bravely about things that she shouldn t be speaking about  But you look at radical liberal Kamala Harris  she s been the ringleader for this anti crime and the anti police crusade  It s a real anti police crusade  They uh just have it out for the police  Nobody knows why  I don t understand why from a common sense  I like to say the Republican Party is now the party of common sense  Conservative  yeah  I guess conservative  It doesn t matter  It s the party of common sense  We want to have borders  We want have strong police protection  We want a military that can protect us  We want great school  school choice ideally  We want have a good life  We want to be safe  But let s review Kamala s pro crime  anti police record  She repeatedly endorsed defunding the police  which I said  and it said a level  and it never goes away  When you re a defunder or when you are even a politician  your first thought usually is the thought that you go with  If she ever had a chance  she would do whatever she could to defund the police  Cause  that s where her spirit is  That s where her heart is  and we can t have a president like that  She sponsored a bill to strip police officers of legal protection leaving you at the mercy of the lawless Marxist prosecutors who want to lock up police officers for sport  They lock them up in many cases long before they lock up the criminal and they go after them too violently  They don t go after the criminals  Murderers are released two hours after the murder  She wants to bankrupt the police unions  She wants to destroy policemen in general  and they ruin your lives  your jobs  and they ruin everything you ve lived for  everything you ve felt that you want to make great  You want to make our country great  When I m President of the United States  again  we will never even think about or mention the words defund the police  We ll never think about that again  It s got to be put away   cheers and applause  It s a bad situation  It s a bad concept  The concept is so chilling and so horrible to think that what we should be thinking about is the opposite of defunding  refunding you called  We ll refund  but we want to help the police  They have a very dangerous job lately  I see if somebody I was with a great family a few months ago  opens the door to a car and gets shot and they have all sorts of protection for the people in the car  You can t have your gun even close to being drawn  You don t know what s happening  A lot of the windows are dark  so you don t know who s in there  but the door opens and just gets shot  Great police officer and many  many cases  A dangerous it s a dangerous business and we have to give them protection and we have to give them love and respect  and that s what we re going to do  We were doing it and they re not doing it now  We ll give our law enforcement heroes the kind of protection and the resources that they so dearly deserve  and I will crack down on local Marxist DAs who refuse to enforce the law  They refuse to put murderers in jail  and you see it all over as the district attorney of San Francisco  Kamala Harris was one of the worst and one of the first Marxist prosecutors in America  She said that uh  and some people said she was the godmother of both sanctuary cities because this was a while ago  This was when it all started  and that horrible shoplifting epidemic  She shielded illegal alien crack dealers from deportation  She fought like hell to have crack dealers not deported  She came up with a concept of $950 and below  You don t even get prosecuted  $950  so guys are walking into stores with calculators to figure out  do you know that they have calculators  They adding it up  They want to make sure they re under 950  but it didn t matter because they didn t prosecute the ones that went over either  She ignored the pleas of victims  families members and refused to seek the death penalty against  as an example  an illegal alien  MS 13 gang member  these are the worst gangs in the world who murdered an innocent man and his two sons were absolutely no reason  They said   Why did you do it   He said   I felt like it  I felt like it   So uh when Kamala  until recently was called a Marxist prosecutor  she didn t even disclaim the title  She sort of liked it  As the California Attorney General  she redefined child sex trafficking  assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person as a nonviolent crime  All of them were redefined by her as nonviolent  Kamala Harris supports abolishing cash bail nationwide  Cash bail has been a disaster  When you abolish the no cash  no cash  don t worry about cash  you murdered somebody  don t worry about it  That was really the beginning of problems for New York  Big problems for New York  but elsewhere also  But it means releasing violent criminals immediately after arrest  No money involved  Don t worry about it  Go home  Enjoy yourself  Many of them disappear  You never find them again  Many of them immediately start killing again  It s just a crazy situation  She supports ending jail sentences for parole violators  She considers a parole violation not to be serious  When the violent mobs of looters and anarchists tried to burn down Minneapolis in 2020  Kamala Harris raised money  bailed to bail out the arsonists and the riders and the killers  People were killed  Many people were killed  Compare that to J6  Nobody was killed  Nobody was killed  There weren t fires set  They burned down the city  They were burning down Minneapolis  and she went out and not only did she work a little bit with them  she worked a lot with them  She worked to get them out and to set them free  One of the criminals Kamala helped bail out of jail was Shawn Michael Tillman  one of the worst  a dangerous repeat offender  Had a horrible record of violence  With Kamala s help  she was set free  He was set free  Soon  went on to murder a man on a train platform for no reason whatsoever in St  Paul  shooting him six times in the head and in the torso  No reason whatsoever  What s the reason  No reason  just felt like it  Kamala Harris will deliver crime  chaos  destruction and death  If she s allowed to be the President of the United States you ll see levels of crime that you ve never seen before  I will deliver law  order  safety and peace  and I will protect those who protect us  These people protect us  These are unbelievable people  They protect us  We have to protect them  We have to give them hope because so many are leaving the forces  I can t speak for this group because I d love to work for them  I would be joining them in two minutes  It looks like a nice job there  So they look because they ve handled themselves and crime and everything else in a stern way  and it s probably uh a lot easier to do  Maybe we should switch them around to different territories of your state  of our nation and let some other guys take would you like that fellers  I have a feeling you don t want that  I don t want to embarrass you   laughter  I don t want to say any particular names of locations  but I can think of a big one in the state  I d love to have them working there during the election  I can tell you  but no  but they have it all very much under control  and that s the way it should be  So we re going to make a record investment in hiring  retention  and training of police officers  We re losing tremendous numbers of police officers  These are men and women that want to be police officers and they re just leaving  We re going to get you reinforcements and we re not going to be doing the negative  Let s pay them much less or let s defund entirely  Let s pay them  There s a movement on now  We won t defund  but we ll pay them much less money  No  No  I ve never realized how dangerous a job it was  I have some papers here where if you watch the event last night this is by the way   holds up chart titled Illegal Immigration into the U S   my all time favorite chart  which is because if you ve watched last night  you wouldn t know that border was so bad  This was right here  this arrow on the bottom  lowest ever  This is made by border patrol  That s the lowest ever we had for illegal aliens coming into our country  And that was the week I left office  That s the lowest ever  Now  this chart is very dear to my heart for another reason  This was the chart  I said   Let me see  Let me see it   But it says a lot  and we had a couple of instances last night where things were mentioned so I got it  Did crime rise under Trump and fall under Biden  They said it rose under Trump  And they go   No  the opposite is true   Take a look at this here   holds up report  It said   Is it true  did crime rise under Trump and fall under Biden    No  the opposite is true   This was a study group that went out and doesn t care  They do the numbers  And there was another one that a historical comparison of the collapse of law enforcement in U S  cities  The drop in arrest rates over the last few years is without precedent  lowest arrest rates we ve ever seen  They don t arrest people anymore  And they shouldn t arrest people for saying the election was rigged  but they liked that  They go after guys like me  but they don t go after people that kill people  It s a shame what s happened in our country  But we re going to turn it around  We re going to win big and we re going to turn it around  We re going to turn it around fast   cheers and applause  Thank you  Thank you  We ll bust up and dismantle the gangs  savage criminal networks and bloodthirsty cartels  and we will stop the Fentanyl  and we ll make sure that Kamala Harris has  and all of the people that she s allowed to come across the border don t forget she was the border czar  whether she wants to hear it or not  CROWD MEMBER  Still is  TRUMP  She still is  Thank you  In fact  you could do it right now  They like to talk  it s all nonsense  that Donald Trump stopped a bill  I was opposed to it  So was everyone else  It was the weakest bill  Under that bill  millions of people would ve been allowed to come in  This was a weak bill  But you didn t need a bill  I didn t have a bill  I said   Close the border   And that s how we got to those numbers  the lowest ever recorded  I said   Close the border   I didn t have a bill  I didn t need a bill  She doesn t need a bill  Biden doesn t know where he is  so where is he  Whatever happened to him  He got out  He got out  He s now sunbathing  He s in a beach someplace  But all he would have to do as president or her is say  close up the border and it s closed  But they don t want to close the border because when they first took over  I had built hundreds of miles of wall and I had 200 miles of wall in addition to what I said I was going to do because certain areas needed it  As we closed areas  other areas became um very  very strong in terms of people wanting to come through  So I bought 200 additional miles  It would ve taken about three weeks to erect it  We re all set to erect it  then we had a terrible election take place  terrible election  And everybody here knows that  And I realized that they don t want to do it  And they actually sold that  And that was designed to the highest specifications of when you look at the steel  it s steel  it s concrete  5 000 pound concrete inside and then rebar  And it also has a lot of technology wires and things in it for high technology  It was designed to the highest specs of the border patrol  I wanted actually concrete plank  I would ve done a beautiful job with precast like you have in parking garages  long span  It s called long span precast  But they had to be able to see through  I understand that  They needed certain things that you can t do with concrete plank  So we did that  and very expensive to do because you needed all sorts in other words  they wanted the steel  they wanted the concrete  It s all different methods of very hard to cut it  very hard to do it when you have different substances  And then very powerful rebar inside  And what happened is  as soon as they came in  they sold it for 5 cents on the dollar  They sold this stuff  Somebody made a lot of money because that steel is very valuable  But they sold all of that hundreds of miles of stuff  You saw it stacked up for a long period of time where they stacked it up in an area because Texas wanted to use it and finish the job  We built hundreds of miles  But Texas wanted it  They would ve paid for it  They refused to sell it to Texas  They refused to sell it to Arizona  And they refused to sell it to anybody  They sold it to the junkyards  I guess  and 5 cents on the dollar  On day one  I will seal the border  I will stop the invasion  We had the border sealed  I had Mexico  I had thousands of soldiers from Mexico  free of charge  I said to the president   You must give us soldiers because they re coming through  The caravans are coming through your country    No  no  no  I cannot do that   I said   Yes  you ll do that  If you don t do that  I m going to put tariffs on your cars   And he said   I will do that  sir    laughter  And he did it  He did it very quickly  And it really  you guys heard all about it  made a great difference  We had thousands of Mexican soldiers guarding our borders that  look  they re coming through your country  You have to guard your southern border  which is their border on the other side  And all of a sudden they started and we had it  We had remain in Mexico  It s called Remain in Mexico policy  which we never had  And they stayed in Tijuana  different places  hundreds of thousands of people that didn t come into our country until they were checked  And then if they were good  we let them in  And if they weren t  we wouldn t let them in  And we worked well with Mexico  actually  But now Mexico has really taken advantage of our country  They want 200 they want billions of dollars just to talk  They wouldn t say that with me  They wanted  I think $2 billion to talk  right   We will talk  We want $2 billion before we even start   That wouldn t happen with me  I would say   Oh really  Is that right  That s the end of trade with Mexico   And they would say   Sir  we will give you two billion  How about that   So I ll send Kamala s illegal aliens back home where they belong  We have a problem because when I came in  they wouldn t accept MS 13 gang members  I told the generals we re going to get the gang members out  ICE and border patrol  the job these people do  But ICE would go into the country  get the MS 13 gang members out  the meanest  the most vicious  They kill people with knives  They killed two young students walking to school  two beautiful  young sixteen year old girls walking to school  They killed them up and chopped them up into pieces with knives  Dead  And ICE goes in and they go into those packs of rough  rough people and ICE is rougher than they are  These are incredible  brave patriots  A lot of people wouldn t want that job  You see fists and feet  you see everything flying  And then two minutes later  they stand up and they grab them and they throw them into what they used to call a paddy wagon  They put them into planes  say   Take them out   The countries wouldn t take them back under President Obama  And I said   Really  They re not going to take them back  Well  if they re not going to take them back  I m going to stop paying them   I said   How much money do we pay these countries  El Salvador  Honduras  Guatemala and others   I said   How much money do we pay   $750 million  I said   Good  Inform them we re not paying them anymore   And the following morning  I got calls from all of these countries   Sir  sir  there must be a misunderstanding  We would love to take them back   cheers and applause  We would love to have MS 13  We would love to have MS 13 back in our country  It would be a great honor to have them back   And before we get too far  we re almost finished  but before we get too far  I want to tell you that we have criminals from all over the world pouring into our country right now   looks towards police  Your job will never be obsolete  It will never be obsolete  unfortunately  It d be nice if we could have peace  but we re not going to have peace  And this is something we re going to have to live with for a long time  She has allowed millions of people  open border  to flow into our country totally unchecked  totally unvetted  And they come from jails and prisons  slightly different  They come from mental institutions  all mental institutions all over the world  This isn t just in South America  People think it s South America  It s from Africa  Asia  the Middle East  A lot of people coming from the Congo in Africa  the Congo  rough  rough  rough  And they re uh prisoners  They re prisoners  And we say   Where do you come from    Africa    Where in Africa    Prison    What did you do    We don t want to say   They turn out to be murderers  These are rough people  And we re allowing them into our country from all ov","er the world  From South America  yes  but from all over the world  They come from insane asylums  And many are terrorists  So we have prisoners  mental patients  mental institution patients  terrorists pouring into our country totally unchecked  unvetted  We have some of the worst terrorists in the world  We know where they are approximately  but we don t know too much  But we know they re the worst  We have the worst terrorists in the world pouring into our country  And she s the president and wants to be the President of the United States  She s vice president  She could do it  She s in charge of the border  She could have closed up the border  She should have closed it up  They could have told Mexico   If you don t do it  we re not going to do something   We re not going to have trade  We re not going to deal with you  We re not going to let you sell your cars into the United States at these ridiculous  where they took 32  of our car industry over many years  They took it out of Detroit  They took it out of different places  But they took it and they took it big from this state  from South Carolina  from a lot of different places  They took 32   And I think now the number is bigger  You know  I don t know if you know that they re building some of the biggest car plants in the world right now in Mexico  Wouldn t have happened with me  Right now in Mexico  And China s the one building them  and they think they re going to build  make these cars and then release them into the United States without tax  It s not going to happen  We ll put a hundred percent to a 200  tariff  We re not going to let it happen  because all of our jobs from your state will be gone  And I watched this union head  he s an incompetent guy  He s approving for what he did for what he s allowed every job  every autoworker here will be out of a job within three years if I m not elected  every autoworker in the state  They re all going to be made in China  They re going to an all electric policy  Well  we have more liquid gold under our feet than any country in the world  but we don t have for what you need for an electric car  But China does  and its territories do and we re not going to let it happen  But they re building some of the biggest plants  And I have a friend who builds plants  He said   Some of the biggest in the world   I think he s doing them   are being built in Mexico   And they re going to sell cars  produce them  and sell them in this country with no taxes  It s not going to happen  I told him  I said   You better hope I don t win   Always dangerous to say these things  Maybe that s why I get shot at and other people don t  right  John James   laughter  That s probably why I get shot at  Other people  they will protect other people because they can t believe they got so lucky  But I have to do what I have to do  I have to do the right thing  The Border Czar Kamala Harris has allowed hordes of illegal alien criminals to literally stampede into our country  We re going to end that on day one  We re going to close our border  We re going to get all of the bad ones out  and we re going to get them out fast  In Shelby Township  Michigan  earlier this year  thirty two year old  previously deported illegal alien  monster  was arrested for repeatedly sexually assaulting a young girl under the age of 13  Local law enforcement described the crimes as absolutely horrific and says he had many other victims  including death is involved  Death  Young girls  In St  Joseph County  Michigan  an illegal alien was recently charged with breaking into a home and sexually assaulting two very little girls  very badly assaulting  In Mississippi  just days ago  an illegal alien child predator was charged with raping a ten year old boy  And there were other cases where they were raping ten year old boys and girls  And in many cases  they were dead  They were killed  Last week  in Coney Island  two Kamala migrants were arrested for the rape of a forty six year old woman  woman who was loved by so many people  throwing her to the ground and raping her over and over again  and then working her over with a knife to her throat  One of them had previously been arrested for raping another woman  but he was shielded from deportation by the New York City sanctuary laws  which Kamala strongly supports  She wants it very much  The woman said he didn t want to rape me  he wanted to kill me  She thought she was dead  She survived  but she thought she was dead  She said he didn t want to rape me  he wanted to kill me  This is what we re allowing into our country  And then you hear   Oh no  the people coming in  they re much less violent than the people  That s not right  They re much more violent and that they make a hat  Sheriff  they make a hat  and I don t want to brag  but it says Trump was right about everything  And if you look  whether it s the border  this  I ve been right about everything  Unfortunately  I wish I wasn t   applause  So when I return to the White House  we will stop the plunder  rape  slaughter  and destruction of our American suburbs  our cities and towns  And I think that women living in the suburbs  I keep hearing about the suburban woman doesn t like Trump  Well  I think it s a fake poll because why wouldn t they like me  I keep the suburbs safe  I stopped low income towers from rising right alongside of their house  and I m keeping the illegal aliens away from the suburbs  I think that they like me a lot  I think it s a lot of fake polls  We ve seen a lot of fake polls over the years  I was not supposed to win anything  and we won the big one  We won it and did a lot better the second time than I did the first  But women want to have safety  They want to have a strong military  They want to have a strong police force  They want to be in their house and they want to be safe   cheers and applause  They don t want to have people pouring into their doors and you can t do anything about it  So I think that s number one thing  I hope they like my personality  I have a nice personality  But to me it wouldn t be very important  the personality  They want to be safe and they want people like this happy  and they want people like this taken care of properly because those are the people that keep them safe  So we ll shut down all deadly sanctuary cities throughout the country because all they do is they shield criminals  They basically shield criminals from prosecution  I will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement  We re going to put a lot of immigration enforcement  We re going to close down the border day one  And we are going to just so you understand  I am not a radical at all  I m just a common sense person that was successful in what I did because of the same thing  We are going to let people  and we want people  to come into our country  A lot of people  we need them  We need them for jobs  We need them for everything  We want people to come in  but they have to come in through a process  They have to come in legally  And we can let a lot of them come in  but John  we want them to come into our country legally   applause  We don t want to let people come in who murdered 19 people and then you hire that person in a plant and all of a sudden you notice that people are being killed all over town  We want them to come in legally  On day one  we ll begin the largest domestic deportation operation in the history of our country  bigger than Dwight Eisenhower  Dwight Eisenhower was very he was sort of a moderate person  but he hated when people poured into our country and he was very strong on deportation  We will remove all criminal aliens immediately  All of the criminals  We start with that  We re going to get them out of here fast  Nothing good is going to happen with thousands of terrorists being in our country  We had one month where border patrol was actually um does a chart  and I don t believe this  I love it in a certain way  but I don t  They said in 2019  zero terrorists came in  Now  I don t believe that  but it s an awfully good statistic  But it was very few that came in  We were very tough on that  We had everybody check so carefully and they added  actually  in 2019  they had zero  Now  you have thousands of terrorists coming into our country  Thousands of terrorists  These are the people that blew up the World Trade Center  Bad things will happen  And if I m elected  we re going to get them the hell out of here and we re going to get them out of here fast  Very fast  And I told you that other countries who really  they put their people into groups  they send them up here  and by the thousands  The caravans  I think it was the name that I came up with  I don t know  maybe somebody will say  he s lying about that  somebody else used the term 14 days earlier   But we came up because it just seemed like an appropriate term  It s a caravan of thousands of people  We have one caravan coming up right now  thousands of people that go right into the country  But I call these they wouldn t take the MS 13 people back or other criminals back  And the generals said   we are just not able to do it  sir  because they won t take them back   They d put planes on the runways so that you couldn t land the plane  They d block up the bus lanes so you couldn t bring the buses and you couldn t get them back  And when I told them that they wouldn t get any more money  I said   let them know they re delinquent  they broken the deal  We re not going to get any more money   We paid them  for years  hundreds of millions of dollars  The next morning  all three countries called me  like clockwork  separately   Sir  is there a misunderstanding  I understand that perhaps you would like to talk to us   I said   yeah  you re sending people into  And they re sending them  by the way  They don t want them  They re sending them  All of the countries are sending them  and now they re coming in because of her  because she s so pathetic and weak at the border  The worst job  The worst border czar in history   applause  I can tell you that  Whether she s a czar or just in charge of the border  it doesn t matter  But they re sending them in levels that we ve never seen before and they re destroying our country  But they all said  all three  it was almost like identical conversations  it was   sir  is there anything we can do to make up for this misunderstanding   I said   yep  you take your MS 13  and you take your gang members and you take your criminals and your drug dealers  We re sending them back and we re sending them back today   And we sent thousands and thousands of people back  This has stopped for years  Under Bush  it stopped and under Obama it stopped  But this had been taking place for years  and I only found out about it  I said   that s good  Get them out   I don t want to put them in our jails because we put them in our jails  what are we going to do  Keep them for 50 years  60 years  And the expense  The really bad ones  we did do that  though  however  because we don t want them coming back  But all of them said   sir  we would be delighted to take MS 13 back  This would be a great honor  They re such lovely people   And we took them out by the thousands  We took MS 13  ICE took MS 13 out of our country by the thousands and thousands and they received them  and that s the way  It s just another little story  but it s a story that s very important because I can t see a guy like Biden making that call  Do you think Biden thinks at night   gee  how are we going to get MS 13 out   He doesn t know he s alive  He didn t know he s alive  And this one is just a Marxist  She s a Marxist  Communist person  and we re not ready for a Communist president  okay  We re not ready for it  We re going to destroy our country  Under my leadership  no community will be surrendered to violent criminals  No citizen will be abandoned to migrant crime  We have a new form of crime  It s called migrant crime  and it s probably more vicious than the crime that we already have  which is pretty vicious  These people are vicious  And please don t let anyone convince you that our criminals  and we have more crime  They are sending massive number of criminals  And you ve heard me say this before  Venezuela crime is down 72   72  Because they ve taken their criminals out of Caracas  they ve taken their criminals out of all of their cities  all of their areas  all over the country  and they re sending them to us  And I m amazed that they re not doing it quicker  to be honest with you  It s happening fast  They re also emptying out the jails  And this is true all over the world  They re emptying out their prisons and they re taking their criminals off the streets  They re taking their drug dealers and their crime rates are down at levels that nobody s ever seen before  And everyone says   oh  so and so s doing a great job running such and such a country   No  they re not  They re just very intelligent  I would do it  if I were them  I would do it much faster  I can t believe they still have some left  But their jails are getting to be very empty  And what they re doing is they re literally dropping them in  They re busing them in and they re bringing them in and they re saying   don t ever come back  If you come back  you get the death penalty   or  if you come back  you get killed  Don t ever come back   And you see the crime statistics are unbelievable  If you look at the jails  the jails are they ve never been so low in the world  I m talking all over the world because they re sending their criminals to the United States of America and they re saying   don t ever come back   And their jails are being emptied and their criminals are being taken off the streets and their crime rates are plummeting  But that s what we want for our country  so we re sending those people back and these are the people that can do it   applause  We re going to have a reformed Department of Justice  We ll  once again  be a friend and partner to our great local police and police officers  general  and we ll be working with victims of crime very closely  but we ll not be working with the criminals that commit the crime  We re going to change it around  Right now  the criminal has a lot more respect within our Department of Justice than the victims  We re going to be working with the victims  We re going to get the gangsters  the drug dealers  the dangerous offenders behind bars  and we re going to get them ideally out of our country  ideally  except in extreme cases  We have some extreme cases where they ve murdered many people  And in that case  we want to make sure they re away  But the amount of crime that we have is unbelievable and the lack of crime that these other places  It just makes so much sense  doesn t it  That s all common sense too  They re taking their criminals and they re bringing them to the United States and they look so great  and cities like Caracas  which was a very dangerous place to be  these are cities that have opened up  they have new life  But our country is suffering  And you know  they just got here over the last two years  mostly over the last couple of years  during this administration  during our great border czar who wants to be our president  They ll be laughing  Watch President Xi  will be laughing  Putin will be laughing  They ll all be laughing  By the way  the war with Russia would ve never started with Ukraine  would ve never started if I was President  October 7th would ve never happened  Iran was broke  They had no money for Hamas  They had no money for Hezbollah  This is a very dangerous time that we re in  It s dangerous in terms of crime and all  but it s very dangerous in terms of a possible World War III  We re very close to World War III and people don t realize it  We re closer than we ve ever been  I think ever since World War II  But this would be the war of wars because of weaponry  This isn t  as I say  two army tanks going back and forth shooting at each other  The level of power  the level of weaponry that there is in the world today is so bad  It s so dangerous  It s so bad  And you need the right person to be President  We had no war when I was President  except that I totally defeated 100  of the ISIS caliphate  Everyone said it would take five years  It took me like about four weeks because we have a great military  We have great generals  Not the ones you see on television  not the ones that did the Afghanistan botchery  but we have great military people  I know them  and they re never going woke  You keep hearing our militaries going woke  The top people would like to see it  but it s never going to these not people  just like these people will never be  turns to police officers behind him  Do you promise you ll never be woke   laughter  I don t see a lot of wokeness  There s not a lot of wokeness   applause  I don t think so  But we re going to stand up for law abiding citizens of America  We re going to be really  I think  an inspiration to the world  But we have to start by remedying a situation that was caused by somebody that right now is running for President of the United States  She would be a disaster as President  I love our country  I didn t need this  I didn t have to do this  I didn t need to get indicted by any time I fly over a state  they indict you  I got indicted more than the great Alphonse Capone  right  For nothing  My father s looking down  my mother s looking down  He was such a good boy  I don t know what happened  But I didn t need this  I had a beautiful life  But to me  I wouldn t change it for the world because we re going to take this country  we re going to make it safe again  and we re going to make America great again  And I want to thank everybody for being here  and God bless you all   cheers and applause  Thank you  REPORTER  Mr  President TRUMP  Thank you everybody very much  Thank you  REPORTER  Mr  President  could you just repond to Kamala Harris  campaign attacking you for being in this town because they say you re a white supremacist or you re a  inaudible  CROWD MEMBER  You re a Democrat   booing  TRUMP  Who was here in 2021  REPORTER  Joe Biden  TRUMP   laughter  Thank you  Thank you  everybody   cheers and applause  CROWD MEMBER  Thank you

beautiful  This is quite a place  It s an honor to be here at Precision Custom Components  a company that has helped to build and defend America for over 150 years  That s really an extraordinary achievement  I want to thank you  President Gary Butler and the members of the wonderful Butler family  members of Congress  Scott Barry  and GT Thompson  You re here someplace in this very big factory  wherever you may be  There you are  Great people  great warriors I will tell you  My trade representative ambassador  Robert Lighthizer  who s fantastic at a thing called trade  We did very well at trade and you were fantastic  And I want to thank you  Bob  very much  And chair of the York County Commissioners  Julie Wheeler   cheers and applause  Thank you  Julie  very much  Thank you  And a very special congratulations to all of the people of York County today who are celebrating the 275th anniversary of York County s founding  That s pretty good   cheers and applause  That beats most of them out there  But most of all  let me thank the exceptionally skilled and talented workers with us in this room  I know you well  I know them from all over the country they come and they are the most talented people and the most brilliant people in so many respects  So thank you all very much for being here  We appreciate it  Thank you   cheers and applause  For generations  the handwork of Precision Custom Components has strengthened the spine of America  Your products have gone into the Hoover Dam and atomic energy plants  nuclear submarines  and they currently are doing a lot of work  I m here today to deliver a simple message  When I m back in the White House  America s future will be built right here in Pennsylvania   cheers and applause  And it will be built by American workers like you  Be all over the country will be building  but Pennsylvania is always a big factor  And we ve had great success  as you know  politically and otherwise in Pennsylvania  And we expect to have it again  We re doing very well here  Thank you very much  With your vote  we will unleash explosive economic growth and vast due prosperity for all of our citizens  We will put more money into your pockets and create millions and millions of new jobs  Gonna do it like nobody else has ever been able to do it  Our plan will massively cut taxes  unlock American energy slash regulations  big factor  crack down on trade cheaters and stop outsourcing  rebuild our industrial base and bring back those beautiful words  Made in the USA    cheers and applause  And we were doing that four years ago and starting to do really well  And then we had to stop for an unknown reason  Together we will reclaim our nation s destiny as the number one manufacturing superpower in the world  We will do it and China won t even be close  Nobody will be  We had that going at a level that nobody s seen before and we re going to have it going again even better  And this firm and this people standing behind me and in front of me will be a big factor  Every policy in Kamala Harris s radical Liberal playbook sends jobs and wealth to other countries   booing  The jobs go to other countries and the wealth goes to other countries  Every policy in the Trump agenda is designed to bring the jobs and wealth back home to America where it belongs and where it s going to stay  Kamala puts America last  I put America first   cheers and applause  Some facts that are interesting  The year before I took office  the United States lost over 10 000 manufacturing jobs  Everybody said you d never bring it back  But under my leadership  we created more than a half a million manufacturing jobs in less than three years  After decades of wage stagnation and income surged  we had a surge like nobody s ever seen before  but it surged for everybody during the Trump administration  every group  everybody  men  women  We had every household was at a level that they ve never really experienced before  The typical American household saw their incomes grow by more than $4 200 per year  Everyone was better off when you had a gentleman named President Donald J  Trump at the helm  Does anybody know him   cheers and applause  whoever he may be  I kept every single promise I made to the workers of Pennsylvania and to every other place within our country  On day one  I withdrew from the unfair job killing Trans Pacific Partnership  And if I didn t do that  you wouldn t be open right now  You wouldn t have a job  That was a big thing  It was approved by another president who would ve destroyed our manufacturing in this country still further  I imposed historic tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel and numerous other things that were unfair to our country and unfair to our workers  I ended the total disaster known as NAFTA  the worst trade deal ever made by this country  and replaced it with the brand new USMCA  That s Mexico and Canada  the best trade deal ever made by our country  although I will tell you that I think the deal with China was probably even better  They had to buy $50 billion worth of our product  but after Covid  I don t even talk about that anymore  $50 billion they had to buy  and they were buying it too  I stood up to China like never before  bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars when no other president had gotten literally 10 cents from China  brought in hundreds of billions of dollars from China  never happened before  Nobody else literally got 10 cents  We passed the largest tax cuts in history  the largest regulation cuts in history  and built the greatest economy of the history of the world  We were at a level that nobody had ever seen before  and now we re going to do it again  but we re going to do it even bigger  better  stronger  and smarter  When I left office  I handed Kamala and crooked Joe Biden a surging economy with no inflation  You had no inflation  You had Everything was good  great wages  no inflation  Now  you have inflation at levels that I don t believe anyone s ever seen before  The 30 year mortgage rate was 2 6   but it was actually closer to 1 9 if you look at it the way that most people look at it  And gasoline had reached and was basically at levels of $1 87 a gallon  but we had months and moments where it was even less than that  Wouldn t that be nice  $1 87  Gary   steps away from podium  That would be very nice  The family likes it more than Gary  Gary s been around too long  The family likes it more  Our economic future  it never looked brighter  When Kamala and Biden came in  they quickly blew it all up  Destroyed  350 000 Americans joined the unemployment rolls last month  Did you know that  I keep hearing about their economy  Their economy s terrible  and the inflation is eating everybody alive  and it s been doing that for three years  The no inflation or almost no inflation  it kept going during the early part of this administration  this current administration  but it ended very quickly  and then it went to levels  and so quickly  it went so fast  and it was a shame  It was all blown up and destroyed  and jobs were lost  A lot of jobs were lost  Our country is doing really badly under them  and nobody wants to talk about it  The media doesn t like talking about it  because the Democrats  they really protect themselves  It s pretty amazing  Someday  the media is going to become real media instead of fake media  and you re going to see a big difference in the country   cheers and applause  Real incomes are down $2 000 a year since she took office  Kamala casts the tie breaking votes that gave us the worst inflation in American history costing a typical family $28 000  Under Kamala  we have fallen into manufacturing recession with 13 000 manufacturing jobs lost in the United States since just the start of this year  I don t know if you all know that  but that s what s happened  And it ll happen here  and it ll happen in this plant  It ll happen everywhere  If she gets in  if Kamala gets in  the United States will rapidly become a de industrialized third world nation like so many others have become  She s running on socialist price controls  banning gas powered cars and trucks  and private health insurance policies are gone  She wants to defund the police  abolish cash bail  She wants to abolish it immediately  cash bail  She wants to abolish ICE  get rid of the incredible brave patriots of ICE who take MS 13 gang members  probably the worst gang anywhere in the world  horrible situation  They take them out  and they take them out bravely  They re strong  They re fierce  and they love our country  She wants to give free healthcare for millions of illegal aliens  and give them all citizenship into the United States immediately  She then wants to sign them up for Medicare and Social Security  and she wants them to vote illegally if possible  any way they can vote  They don t care if it s illegal or not   booing  and they re signing people up as we speak  They re signing them up as we speak  They don t care  They don t care about the laws  Very simply  Kamala Harris is an economy wrecker and a country destroyer  Our country will be destroyed if she gets in  Her radical liberal agenda ruined San Francisco  It ruined California when she was the Attorney General  It crushed our middle class  demolished our border  set the world on fire  and now she wants to be promoted to the job killer in chief  but much more than job killer  Everything else is going to go bad  She set the standard in California  Think of this  If you steal $950 or less  they re going to leave you alone  They can t be bothered  So  you see criminals going into stores with a little computer adding it up  everything they ve stolen  They want to stay under the 950  but they don t get prosecuted for above that  The only one that gets prosecuted is somebody who would talk about the unfair election  They get prosecuted  But when you steal and rob and kill and so many other things  when you sell drugs and destroy people s lives  nothing happens to you under Kamala  but we will not let this happen  We re not going to let it happen to our country  78 days from now  Pennsylvania is going to tell her that we ve had enough  that we can t take it anymore  Comrade   cheers and applause  comrade  Kamala  Harris  you are fired  Get out  You re not doing the job  Get out   cheers and applause  You are fired  While Biden and Harris have been impoverishing our country  they have been getting rich  very rich at your expense  Now  it just came out  just was reported today by a great young reporter  Brooke Singman at Fox  According to a 292 page report from the House Oversight Judiciary on Ways and Means Committees in Congress  just got out a little while ago just before I got here  I said   No  I want to talk about it just briefly   It s so sad  because he s going to be making his speech tonight  and they don t call him crooked Joe for no reason  They said   President Biden engaged in impeachable conduct  and said he abused his office and defrauded the United States of America to enrich his family   Republicans revealed that since 2014  the Biden family and its associates received more than $27 million from foreign individuals and entities  They also found that while Biden was serving as vice president  the Biden family got more than $8 million in loans from Democrat benefactors  and they said that those loans have never been repaid  Those are the best kind of loans  aren t they  This report says in part that Vice President Biden actively participated in this conspiracy by  among other things  attending dinners with his family  foreign business  partners  and speaking to them by phone  often being placed on speakerphone by Hunter Biden  Republicans are calling out a 2014 dinner that Hunter Biden and his family attended with a Russian oligarch  They said that after that dinner  that oligarch wired $3 5 million to Hunter Biden s firm very quickly  It was a very quick wiring  I m sure he worked very hard for the money  Several witnesses testified that Hunter Biden invoked his father in business dealings with Romanian  Chinese  Kazakhstani  and Ukrainian companies in addition to other companies and people  resulting in millions and millions of dollars flowing into the Biden family  As everybody knows  $3 5 million was sent from the mayor of Moscow  the mayor of Moscow s wife  Remember  I brought that up in the debate I had  I said   Why did this happen   And the anchor wouldn t let me ask that question  They thought it was inappropriate  but then it blew up  $ 3 5 million dollars was sent by the mayor of Moscow s wife to the family  They were also calling out Biden for his handling of classified documents  They said during his tenure as vice president  Joe Biden removed highly sensitive classified documents from the White House  despite having no authority to do so  And remember  comrade Kamala  she knew everything  and the senators knew what was going on  By the way  I had my own classified documents case  and I was totally exonerated  totally   cheers and applause  It was a case brought by Joe Biden and Kamala  She was involved  They did that in order to interfere with the election  and it still goes on different cases  but that was according to most the big one  and we were totally exonerated  The case was won a month ago  Very little coverage of the case being won  I must say  I think that a lot of the media didn t even talk about it  There s no way someone could have stolen that much money without Democrat senators knowing what was going on  He wined and dined them at Joe s houses  They saw his boats  They saw the way he lived  They saw his beautiful mansions  I would ve made billions of dollars in this job if I wanted to play that game the way they played it  but instead  I took the job very seriously and very importantly  And you can see from the recently announced financial reports  I don t need the money  and I m proud to announce that doing and being president  I lost billions of dollars  and I knew that would happen  Maybe not quite as much as that  but I m satisfied with that  because we want to make America great again  That s much more important  We have to make America great again   cheers and applause  Though  I could have played it the other way  I could have made so much  I see some of my friends over here  I could have made so much  No  I didn t want to do that  This is too important  This is too big a thing  We got to save our country  because our country is really in big trouble  We re a nation in decline  We re going down the drain  The drain is the swamp that you ve heard so much about  They get rich  and in Washington  some of these politicians  what they re doing to our country is disgraceful  but he s one of the leaders of the pack  You have others  The number one step we will take to launch a great American manufacturing renaissance will be to end Kamala Harris  war on American energy  It s a war  and you do know that inflation was caused by her cutback on energy  Then what they did is they  in a panic  move shortly thereafter when the numbers for gasoline  oil  and electricity and everything else that comes from energy and out of energy  When they started going through the roof  they immediately went back to the Trump plan  but what they didn t go back to is my plan would ve been doubled  tripled  and even quadrupled from the numbers I had four years ago  They didn t do that  They brought it back to a similar  because they were getting just absolutely destroyed by the numbers  It was going up  and you can bet that if we don t win  she takes over  Your energy numbers will be triple and quadruple  and you won t be producing a drop of oil  They ended the largest oil reserve anywhere in the world  probably as large as Saudi Arabia  The Saudi Arabia has this massive amount of oil  It s called ANWR in Alaska  They ended it on close to day one  They ended it  Ronald Reagan couldn t get it  No other president got it  I got it  and it s bigger than Russia  bigger than Saudi Arabia most likely  They seem to think biggest in the world they ve been after  They ve been after getting that approved for many  many decades  Ronald Reagan worked so hard to get it  He couldn t get it  I got it  and then they ended it  They were just set to start drilling  Everything was done  and he came into office  He ended it  On day one  I will tell the frackers and energy workers of Pennsylvania to drill  baby  drill    cheers and applause  and she s totally a non fracker  You know that  Until a few months ago  she said   Oh   It s just like on tips  We re not going to tax tips  All of a sudden  she comes out and she says the same thing  exactly the same words that I used months later  and other things she said  like trying to copy my policy  but it takes much more than copying a policy  because they re never going to produce it anyway  Our country s going to be in serious trouble  but she was a non fracker  no fracking under any circumstances  She s like 100 times saying   I will not frack   Look at her debates  There will be no fracking  There will be no   Then a few months ago  she said   Oh  we d love to frack with a politician   They go back to their original thought  There will be no fracking if she s elected in Pennsylvania or anywhere else  You ll have energy that will go up three  four  five times  You ll be paying $10 a gallon for gasoline  and a lot higher than that  Unleashing American energy will reduce prices  launch record setting economic growth  create millions and millions of jobs  and produce higher wages for the American worker  You can t be a manufacturing powerhouse unless you have low cost energy  We will have low cost energy   cheers  Electricity rates for a Chinese factory are more than 50  lower than the price of electricity for an American factory  and we were working four years ago at really getting it along  and then we were hit with uh  The Covid came in  We focused on that  We did a great job  If we didn t do a great job in that  we would ve been in a depression like in 1929  which is where you re heading if she gets in  You re heading for the depression of 1929  that type  That s called the big league depression  Since Kamala took office  electricity prices in America up much more than 30  nationwide  and here in Pennsylvania  they re expected to increase by another 30   They think it s going to be actually unsustainable for your state if she gets in  It s not sustainable  It s not sustainable for the country  That s why I ve declared that a top priority for my administration will be to cut the cost of energy in half within the first 12 months of taking office   cheers and applause  So  we ll cut it in half  I think we ll be able to do better than that  We re going to be cutting it in half  guys  That ll help you a little bit  inaudible   CROWD MEMBER  Absolutely  TRUMP  I think we ll do that very quickly  That includes heating  air conditioning  electricity  and gasoline  Your bills will be less than half  When you look at the New England area  they pay some of the highest energy anywhere in the world because they can t put a pipeline in  They ve been restricted from putting a pipeline in through a certain section of New York that is desperately wanting it  They need the job so badly  And if they did that in New England  the prices would come down half just with the pipeline alone  They were getting their gasoline and their energy from a place called Russia  Ships would pull up on the east coast  Russian ships  and that s where New England got it from  and they were paying a big price  And to this day  they re paying the highest prices  but we ll take care of that  We think energy costs  all of it  air conditioning  heating  all of it  including gasoline  will drop by more than 50  within the first 12 months   cheers and applause  So remember that  That includes for factories   cheers and applause  This will help us quickly defeat inflation and make America affordable again  By contrast  Kamala Harris wants to ban fracking  She supports a national carbon tax  which is a horrible tax that will destroy many businesses  that will have a huge impact on this business  but that will destroy a carbon tax  Nobody even knows what it is  Nobody knows how to calculate it  And she imposed a natural gas export ban  all catastrophic things for Pennsylvania   booing  That means all the income coming in  For the most part  you ll have none of it  You ll lose 500  000 jobs and you won t have the income coming up  That means Pennsylvania is going to have to pay  your commonwealth  your beautiful commonwealth is going to have to pay numbers that nobody ever thought even possible or worth discussion  Kamala is also on a regulatory jihad to shut down power plants all across America  Now  Germany tried it just a couple of years ago and they ended up getting rid of their political leaders very quickly  and now they re building probably 50 or 60 power plants currently  and they re looking to build a lot more  But they got rid of everything and they wanted to go to wind and solar and lots of other things  Unfortunately  it didn t work  They couldn t fire up the plants  The plants were closed and they couldn t get them going  and now they ve gone to the other extreme  They ve gone back to fossil fuel  I hope clean fossil fuel  clean coal  They do have clean coal  They have coal that actually has to make your electricity  And if you didn t have fossil fuel  you wouldn t have electricity because that s where it comes from originally  And you can have very clean and efficient natural gas  At least 50 existing power plants have closed since she took office  Kamala took office  They re closing them all over the country  They re closing nuclear  They re closing coal  They re closing everything  We re not going to have   That s why in California  you have blackouts all the time  constant blackouts  and yet they want to go to all electric cars  Let s go to all electric cars  even though we don t have enough electricity to give it ourselves some cool and some heat in the summers and the winters  I m announcing today that when I return to the White House  I will end the anti American energy crusade and terminate Kamala s so called power plant rule  It s a disaster for our country  Our country will have no jobs by the time these communists and Marxists get rid of I mean when they when they destroy the country  probably can never come back either  just so you understand  Too much competition from other countries that are doing it right  We have a lot of competition out there  Not only China  we have a lot of other competition  Instead of shutting down power plants  we will open dozens and dozens more  and they ll happen fast  Kamala stands for energy disappearance and factory obliteration  She will obliterate factories like this  I stand for American energy independence and manufacturing dominance  We re going to be dominant in manufacturing  We re going to be dominant in energy too  not just um getting it to take care of ourselves  We re going to be selling it all over the world  We re going to be reducing our debt  We re going to be lowering your taxes still further  Don t forget I gave you the largest tax cut in history  We re going to be lowering your taxes still further  Upon taking office  I will do rapid approvals for new energy infrastructure  and we will embrace all forms of energy including nuclear  Nuclear is a great energy  This plant is making some things that I just got to see  and it s incredible what you ve done  what Gary and the family have done  The level of complexity  the level of detail  the power that we re talking about is incredible to power our country into the future  including the electricity demands of AI and cryptocurrencies  which is a very big subject  It s coming up more and more  and we have to stay at the top  We want to be right at the forefront  Otherwise China and other countries will take it over  That s both of them  AI and crypto  We will make a historic commitment to bring in advanced small modular nuclear reactors online  building these massive plants that cost $20 billion and don t even get built like we had recently in a couple of other states  I won t mention the states  but they had two plants that got so out of control with cost overruns  massive  massive nuclear plants  Now we re going to do small reactors  small nuclear  we call it  France does that  France does very well with that  They do small  And if they need more  they build a second one  a third one  a fourth one  They hook them up together  With the help of companies like yours  these can be built ultra safe  They re ultra clean  and they re very low cost  but they are absolutely safe  Under Kamala s green new scam  billions and billions of taxpayer dollars are being sent to subsidize solar panel factories  windmill factories  battery production and car production all based in China  We are subsidizing massive amounts of product for solar  for wind  It s all made in China  Under the Trump administration  we will build American  buy American  and hire American   cheers and applause  That s what we re going to be doing  Kamala s economic agenda rewards outsourcers and punishes American workers by making it economically impossible to manufacture in America  What I m promising today is a total pro American overhaul of our tax regulation and trade systems to promote domestic production and punish those who ship jobs and factories overseas or to places like Mexico  where right now  the head of the United Auto workers doesn t know this  They re building some of the biggest car factories  just started  anywhere in the world  The person I know builds car factories  That s all he does  build car factories  He said the biggest ones in the world are being right now in Mexico  And they think they re going to bring those cars in  make them in Mexico  bring them in here  and sell them to our people and destroy Detroit and the rest of our car business  They ve already taken 30  before I got there  30   They did nothing against us when I was there  I told them   If you want to build car factories  you re going to have to pay a 100  tariff to get the car into this country   They immediately said   Well  I guess we re not going to build a car factory   Right  That s what happened  but now they re building the biggest in the world right in Mexico  and they think they re going to take our car  They re not going to do that if I m here because I will be putting massive tariffs on those cars coming across the border  and it won t make any economic sense  So I actually think they should stop building them unless they want to sell those cars to another country  Kamala wants no taxes on Chinese producers  wants no taxes  What s that all about  While imposing the largest tax hike in the history of our country on factories in the United States  Okay  so she wants a no tax policy on China  but she wants to tax factories like this and other factories at levels that they ve never seen before  Under her plan  manufacturers will pay even higher taxes in America than in Communist China  By contrast  I will pass gigantic tax cuts for workers and keep their jobs here in the United States  They re going to stay here   cheers and applause  We re going to beat everybody  We re going to beat them like a drum   cheers and applause  And we were doing that against China  There was a long time expression that China will take over the world s largest economy  It ll take it over in 2019  Well  in 2019 we were doing so well  2018  2017  that China never even came close  We were lapping them  They never came close  And even President Xi said congratulations  They thought they would be long time  this is 15  20 years ago  they said   2018  2019  China will dominate   Nope  we were doing It would never happen  In fact  I said after we started really doing it  as long as we have smart presidents  they ll never catch us because they can t beat our system  We will have big tax cuts for families and small businesses  and we will have no tax on social security and no tax on tips   cheers and applause  So they haven t copied Social Security yet  but they will  Don t forget  he s the one that destroyed our seniors with inflation  Inflation has destroyed our seniors  It s the worst thing that could happen  The people that behaved the best that did it the American way  that saved their money  they got decimated because their money went down because they couldn t live  They were losing money  With me  they were putting money in the bank and making a lot of money  They were saving a lot of money  After I left  they were losing all of that money they saved  Kamala wants to spend $1 7 trillion in wasteful spending  causing more inflation  And she says it s a mistake to ask her how she s going to pay for it   Please  it s a mistake   She just said it  She just said something that nobody has any idea what she said  but she said it s a mistake to ask how we re paying for it  Kamala Harris can t answer how she d pay for any of her new radicalized liberal spending schemes that will bankrupt our country  and do it quickly  destroy social security  destroy Medicare  She has no clue how d she pay for $25 000 to every first time home buyer  including illegals  just like they were going to pay the bills of college students  Unfortunately  that didn t happen and won t happen  They gave up that  Supreme Court gave it up because it was unfair to all of those people  One of the reasons  all of the people for years and years that paid back their loans  and now we re going to give something free  but it didn t happen  It was just talk  He knew it wouldn t happen too  Crooked Joe  he knew that was not going to ha","ppen  No clue how she d pay for free healthcare for illegals  She wants to give free healthcare to illegals  Now  you want to stop people from coming into our country  the first thing you do  and you would have to do this immediately  no healthcare  We can t do that  We can t afford it  It s not sustainable  but they re doing it  Just the opposite  Come to America  Live the American dream  We ll give your children free schooling  We ll give you free healthcare  We ll give you pensions  We ll put you into social security  This is why people are pouring into our country in the caravans  That s a very dangerous trip  Thousands and thousands of people are dying in those caravans coming up to our country  and they re coming up because the promises are being made to them that just can t be kept  No clue how she d pay for the $100 trillion  think of that 100 trillion with a T  dollar green new scam  It s a scam  Out of the $100 trillion  you wouldn t There s not $1 of it that would help our country  not $1 of it  It ll destroy our country  And no clue how she d pay for the hundreds of billions of dollars in new foreign aid giveaways  We re giving away money at levels that nobody has ever seen before  No other country would do it  No other country would be so stupid to do it  That s why it s so important to vote for Trump to stop the reckless spending and the destruction of our country  We will not have a country left  I will stop the special interest giveaways  cut waste  and restore common sense to our government  The Republican Party is the Republican Party of common sense   cheers and applause  That s what it is  Kamala will bury American workers in regulations  I will liberate our workers with the largest regulatory cuts ever recorded  We ve already done some of them  but she put them right back  They put them right back  Repealing every single job killing regulation of the Biden Harris administration  The electric vehicle mandate  which is absolutely so crazy  will be gone  and there will be no costly forced transition to all electric cars and trucks  If you want a gasoline propelled car or a hybrid or an electric car  they re wonderful too  but not all  People need to go longer distances  They want to pay less money  Fantastic  Electric is fantas Everything is great  You have to be able to buy everything  They have a mandate  We don t have enough of electricity for ourselves  and now they re talking about putting all the cars on it  Well  it doesn t work because the cars don t go far  If you d like to go from here to  let s say Washington to look after we fix the capital up and make it safe again  which will take approximately like quickly  but after we fix it up  and if you want to drive there  you don t want to stop five times  you want to be able to go there and you want to be able to enjoy it  and you don t want to be mugged or shot or killed in our capitol  which has become very unsafe  It s horribly run  graffiti stained  and we re going to fix it very quickly and beautifully  We re going to make it the most beautiful capitol anywhere in the world  and we re going to make it totally safe  Police are going to do a great job  Simultaneously  we will modernize our trade policies  The United States has long been taken advantage of by other countries at levels that nobody has any idea  I would sit and look at these trade deals  many of which we renegotiated with Japan  with South Korea  with Canada  Mexico  many  But I d look at these deals before we did the renegotiations and say   Who would make deals like this   I mean  they were either crooked or really stupid  one or the other  probably crooked for the most part because I don t think they re stupid  But we had the worst trade deals  No country s ever had trade deals like  We fixed many of them  made some of them extraordinary  We lose jobs in revenue  They gain everything  We lose jobs  We lose revenue  They destroy our country  They gain everything  and they wipe out our businesses  which is good for them because then they can supply us with whatever we were making  I stopped it four years ago and I will stop it very quickly again  and we ll be making the product ourselves with our labor  We will not let countries come in  take our jobs  and plunder our nation into poverty   cheers and applause  The way they will sell their product in America without having to pay any substantial tariff for tax is to build their factory in America and build their product in America using only American help  and we have the help   cheers and applause  Kamala Harris says that a tariff is a tax on American consumers  She s wrong  It s a tax on a foreign producer  It s a tax on a foreign country  and I proved that better than anybody because I took in hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs on different states  on different countries  And out of all of that money  we had no inflation  We had no inflation  It also gives you power over that country  If they want to have wars with somebody  we can say no  If you do have wars  we re going to raise your tariffs  Oh sir  we won t have a war  We re okay with it when we ve decided not to go after somebody  One thing a little off this  everybody said   Oh  we might have wars with Trump   We had no wars with Trump  First time in 78 years  we had no wars  other than I finished some like ISIS   cheers and applause  100   defeated 100  of the ISIS caliphate  What they did is Afghanistan  the most embarrassing day in the history of our country  And none of the generals got fired for the incompetence that they showed  Most embarrassing moment  We would ve left with dignity and strength  We would ve taken our $85 billion worth of equipment  We would ve taken our hostages  We lost 13 great  great people  We had 47 people obliterated the arms  the legs  the face obliterated  What a horrible day it was  What an embarrassment  What a horrible day to have death  to have such injuries  Nobody talks about the 47 people that lost their limbs that will suffer for the rest of their lives  As I ve said many  many times before  as tariffs on foreign countries go up  taxes on American workers and families come down  According to one recent study  a small 10  tariff on foreign made products will allow massive tax cuts for working families  Create more than 3 million American jobs  raise household incomes by 6   Think of that   cheers and applause  And the 6  equates to $4 200 a year for a household  and generate almost a trillion dollars in economic growth  And it will go very quickly  It will also get rid of a large portion of our deficit  Because we don t want countries coming in here  stealing our jobs  hurting our country  killing our workers  leaving with everything  and we as usual end up with empty factory buildings that are falling down  We end up with nothing  We want tariffs  If somebody wants to come in and take our jobs  if somebody wants to come in and sell us their product that s made in their country  that s okay  but they ve got to pay tariffs  They ve got to pay a price for that  We re going to bring down your taxes at levels never seen before  We re going to pay off debt of our country  because this country owes $35 trillion  But that rapidly can come down  And remember this  we re sitting on the largest amount of oil and gas  We have  I call it liquid gold  We have more liquid gold than Saudi Arabia  We have more liquid gold than Russia  but we don t use it  We go out and we buy from other countries at ridiculous prices  We buy now from Venezuela  we buy tar  It s not really It s tar  And you know where we refine it  At a factory  Only one factory in the world can do it because of the nature of it  It s tar  It s not good stuff  It s in Houston  Texas  So all of that  if you re an environmentalist  all of that s going right into the air in our country  We bring in lots of tar  loads of it  We dump it in Houston  and they refine it  We have pure stuff  We have the best and we have the most right under our feet  It s liquid gold  And we re going to use it  and we re going to reduce our deficit  We re going to reduce our debt  and we re going to reduce your taxes  We re going to do everything right  and it s going to happen quickly too   cheers and applause  And as we reduce burdens on US manufacturers  our workers can make goods better and cheaper right here in our own country  and right here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  We don t need lectures on the economy from a candidate pushing communist price controls  Kamala has no idea what the hell she s doing  Her father is a Marxist professor  and I believe he taught her well  You know he s a Marxist professor  Can you imagine  Does anyone know that  I wonder if they knew that when they did an overthrow or a coup on Joe Biden  I wonder if they knew where she comes from  where she came from  what her ideology is  But you could see it a little bit by this whack job  You know  he said  we are weird  That JD and I are weird  I think we re extremely normal people  like you  exactly like you  He s weird  Did you ever see him go on the stage and go like crazy  It s like between his movement and her laugh  there s a lot of craziness  I d say a step further than weird  Weird is a nice word by comparison  When I m president  we re going to do things right  And when I was president  we imposed historic tariffs and prices  and we did it all  We did it all  Prices didn t go up  Everybody said   Oh  if you do that  prices   No  the country made less money  That s what happened  Gave us tremendous political leverage over those countries too for things having nothing to do with economics  They heard China  not America  That s why the Biden administration had no choice but to leave them in place  They ve left them in place  They wanted to take them off  But so much money comes in from China and other places with the tariffs that I put on  that Joe Biden  as much as he wanted to do his friends a favor  couldn t do him too much money  You couldn t justify it  There was no way to justify it  And my next term  I will revoke China s most favorite nation trade status  It s very unfair   cheers and applause  And by the way  I have great respect for President Xi  I think China and the United States will get along well together  Until COVID came in  that was a step too far  But I had a great relationship with President Xi  I had a great relationship with most of the leaders  I ll pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act  so that if China or any other countries  not just China  the European Union treats us very badly  Nobody knows that  Very badly  We have a 250 billion deficit now with the European Union  But if China  or the European Union  if any other group of countries or country makes us pay a 100  or 200  tariff or tax  we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff or tax of the exact same amount  So it s basically  you hurt us  we hurt you  It s an eye for an eye  and it s common sense   applause  We will ensure that we have 100  domestic American supply chains of all essential goods  Our supply chain has crashed  And you don t write about it now  but it still crashed  And all you have to do is say   Where s the package that was supposed to be here three months ago   People aren t getting them  It s very bad what s happened  They ve destroyed our supply chain  which is something I didn t think could be done  COVID proved that if we need it in a crisis  then we must be able to make it in America  We want to rely on ourselves  We have no choice  This is really a matter of national security  We will bring back electronic production  We re going to bring up electronics too  Electronics  we buy everything  away  When you see the sophistication of the product I just saw at this place  electronics is peanuts by comparison  but pharmaceutical too  it s outside of this country  95  we re reliant on various other countries  good countries  nothing wrong  but we want to do it ourselves  They make a tremendous amount of money  and we lose our jobs  And we want to do it ourselves  Mineral production  car production  We re going to bring back the auto industry  We can do that  We can do better than anybody in the world  They ve stolen 59  of our car making business  The union  the United Auto Workers  I think the people in that union are going to vote for me overwhelmingly  because I m going to bring car industry back  They are destroying it  When they agreed to all electric cars  they re not going to be made in this country  We ll be making no cars in this country  And I was the one with South Korea  they got the tax put on and extended on the small trucks  And if I didn t have that tax  the most successful product made in this country is the small trucks  If I didn t get that tax  South Korea and China would be destroying us now with additional product  We saved them  So I hope the autoworkers are listening  because they have a union boss that doesn t have a clue  He doesn t have a clue  It s sad  I wish he did  I don t have to like him  I wish he did  But he doesn t have a clue  What he s done to the auto business in allowing this to happen  where all of those cars are going to be made in China and it s going to happen quickly  With the help of companies like this one  we will rebuild our hallowed out defense industrial base  ensuring that America is never in a situation where we don t have tanks  missiles  the raw materials to fight and win a war  We have to have those  What would happen if we had a war  We won t  with me  But you will have World War Three  I believe  without me  But we won t have  But what would happen if we did  And let s say it was with China  but they give us all of our steel  So we ll have to call China for steel so we can fight a war with them  How stupid are these people  Upon taking office  I will invoke the Defense Production Act wherever it s necessary to quick very quickly ramp up capacity of essential products  And I will stop Japan from buying United States steel   cheers  We have a foreign country that wants to purchase one of our greatest  If you go back 70 years  our greatest country  our greatest company by far was United States Steel Corporation  That was the big deal  And now we have Japan buying it  They shouldn t be allowed to buy it  We have to make it work  We have to make it work  You don t want to sell US Steel  This is how we will rediscover the industrial heritage of our country  We will reclaim our manufacturing legacy  We will build up glorious American future fueled by Pennsylvania energy  You re one of the largest in this country  You re one of the largest producers in the world  She doesn t know that  You re not going to produce  You re going to go from being one of the largest producers in terms of fracking  the energy produced into a non factor  Your state s going to be third world  like much of our country is being made third world by these people  They don t have a clue  But it s going to all be made with pride of the US and with Pennsylvania pride  and strengthened by strong  powerful Pennsylvania steel again  With your vote  we will destroy inflation  bring down prices  And prices are going to come down very substantially  Achieve incredible economic growth  make America wealthy again  and we will bring back  most importantly  we re going to bring back a thing called the American Dream  The American dream is dead  Right now the American dream is dead  We re going to bring back the American dream  So vote for Trump on November 5th  We will be the most  cheers and applause  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you very much  CROWD  USA   USA   USA   USA  TRUMP  Thank you to Pennsylvania  The reception coming here with the people outside waving  it was a beautiful site  The love that they have for what we re trying to do  and what we will do  I just leave you with this  Vote on November 5th or sooner  November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country  We re going to turn our country around  We re going to make America great again  Thank you everybody  God bless you   cheers and applause  God bless Pennsylvania  God bless America  Thank you very much everybody   cheers and applause   music  Lee Greenwood  God Bless the USA  ","",""

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373857",7847,"GOVERNOR WALZ  First of all  Coach  thank you  To each of you  thanks  I know we re interrupting your practice  The busy part and the important part is out there on the field  but thank you for having us on this  MR  PATRICK  Appreciate it  Thank you for coming  GOVERNOR WALZ  This is a    this is pretty sacred ground  Folks in Minnesota know about this place  We know about this team  We know the people you produce    not just FN     NFL players but    but men of a character that come out of this program  because  as Doug said    I m privileged to be on this team    I m the current governor of Minnesota  but for 20 years  this was the time of year I looked forward to most  I was a defensive coordinator at Mankato West High School and coached football and    and taught school  Public schools are the foundation of our country  And I don t have to tell you  anybody who tells you that it s just a game    this is more than just a game  This is about building character  It s about doing something bigger than yourself  It s about trusting the person that s standing on each side of you  and  on Friday night  you know they ll be there  And if you look around here  the moments that you re living right now  these guys will be around your whole life  You ll remember them  You ll remember these plays  I can still remember every single call during that state    first state championship  how it went  It s that important  I ve told people  and they think I m joking about it  it was harder to win that state football championship than it was to become governor  so     laughter     it s tough work  You got to count on a lot of things  You got to do a lot of things  And on our team  we ran a 4 4 defense   Addressing Jerome Bettis   I wouldn t have wanted to go against this guy  I can tell you that  but     laughter   There s no stopping that run  But the kids played hard and    and they understood that it was something bigger than themselves  And I ll have to tell you  being out here with    with Vice President Harris  I know it d be easy    especially now  our politics has been pretty ugly  Our politics has seemed pretty negative  Our politics is something that I know what I fear most is  is that young people turn away from it rather than turning into it  Politics isn t that much different than this  It s about something bigger than themselves  It s about setting a future goal and trying to reach it  It s about doing it with dignity and hard work  It s about doing it with humility  And when you lose  you walk across the field and you shake hands with the other team and know they played hard too  But we re all in it together to try and make it better  And things like investing in this public school and having    I can t imagine what this place looks like when it s filled with folks and the lights are on and the leaves are turning and that game is in the fourth quarter and somebody has to make that play  somebody has to step up  and you look to each side of you and you know   I trust them  I trust them to make that play   Our country s not that different  Our neighbors want to be with you  Our neighbors want to do what s right  And the more we figure out that we re in this thing together and we have more in common than we have separated  we re going to do a heck of a lot better  So  I have to tell you  thanks for taking some time  Thanks for giving us the privilege to stand on this field  because you earned the right to be on this field  You earn it with a lot of sweat  You earn it with a lot of time in the weight room  You earn it with the folks who came before you and know that they care how you conduct yourselves on this  and we feel the same way  We have a responsibility to the American public to conduct ourselves with dignity  conduct ourselves with a vision  and to conduct ourselves and all of this    when football s done right  it is just fun as heck to play the game  And that s the way things can be  So  I have to tell you  I am just honored to be with this leader  I m honored with someone who s showing us that  I m honored with someone who s out doing politics with a smile on her face and with a sense of that everybody matters  And we re here in this space to say    it s not just a cliché    our future is with you  and we have a responsibility to deliver it to you in good shape  to make sure that we re doing the right things to give you a good shot at the future  And so  for me  it s a privilege to be on this team  It s a privilege to see this leader do it with such joy  And it s a privilege for me to get to introduce to you    and this is  like  some of the first times I m getting to do this    the next president of the United States  Kamala Harris   Applause   THE VICE PRESIDENT  So  I ve been reading about you all and hearing about you and your excellence and how you work as a team  And we ve got 79 days to go until the election  but we wanted to stop by and I wanted to stop by so I could tell you all in person  looking at each of you in your eyes  that our nation is counting on you and your excellence  We applaud your ambition  You want to compete  You want to win  And I will tell you that we  as a country  deserve to give you every opportunity that you have to achieve your excellence that you were born with  that is God given  and that is going to be laying the path to the future of our nation  You all are the future of our country  And you all have known from the day you were born  we re all born leaders  and it s just a matter of when people decide to turn that on  The fact that you re on this field today tells me you decided to turn it on at an early stage of your life    to be a leader and to be a role model  And  you know  it s not easy being a role model  Welcome to the role model club     laughter     right  Being a role model  Pete  means that members of your family  people you know in the neighborhood  others  your classmates  they watch you to see what you do  What goes into that kind of excellence  What goes into being a winning team  And you all have taken it upon yourselves to take on that responsibility of being role models and to inspire people you may not even know are watching you to see how you can achieve success  And by doing that and all that that requires    which is the hard work  the practice  working as a team  knowing that you will be undefeated  even if you don t win every game  but no circumstance or event or moment will defeat your spirit and your fight and your preparedness to win and excel  that nothing will dampen your spirit of excellence    that s what I m counting on from each of you and that s what makes our nation strong  So  you keep doing what you re doing and know that there are so many people you may not see at any one moment who are cheering you on  When they re in the stands  when you re in your classroom  when you are living your life on a daily basis  know that we are applauding you in everything that you are and do    on this field when you are playing and off this field when you are just being the leaders that I know you are  You wouldn t be able to be such a successful team if you weren t leaders in every way  And the last point I ll make is this  One of the other things that we really are counting on for your leadership is to remind folks that we are a team  right  Everybody has a li     little bit that s different about them  But within the vast majority of us who have seemingly differences  the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us  And you guys know that  You know that in the way you operate as one team  So  take that spirit with

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373858",10175,"GOVERNOR WALZ  Oh  man     applause     it is  Doug gets the bro hugs  He brings it  so     laughter   Well  thank you  and it s true  And    and to Gwen and Doug  both  I    all of you    none of us do this alone  We re all in this together  I think this is a room that knows this campaign will be won in rooms just like this all across the country   Applause   It will be run with people sitting on the phone banks in there  dialing numbers  and people picking up the phone on a Sunday and having somebody say   Do you have a minute to talk about the future of our country   That s a pretty big step to pick up that phone and talk  But listening to these folks in here  people are doing it  They re doing it  And the thing I can tell you what Kamala Harris has brought to this for so many things    from experience as a prosecutor to an attorney general to a United States senator to a vice president to the next President of the United States     applause     th     there s that resume  which is out    without question  but the reason they re picking up the phone and the reason that they re standing thousand deep in 109 degree heat in Las Vegas is  She s bringing out the joy in the hearts of Americans  She s bringing out     applause     she s bringing out the kindness that ties us together  the decency  the vision of a better tomorrow  And these     applause     each of these volunteers and the people who put it on  they all said it  They said it is so much better to be for for something rather than against something    to be for the future  not going back  Those     applause    that s what people know  And we    some of us who have less hair and are old enough    can remember when you could go to Thanksgiving  watch a Steelers game with your relatives  and not complain about politics the whole time  not be on each other s neck     applause     because you shared a commitment to democracy  a commitment to personal freedoms  a commitment to public education  a commitment to infrastructure   Applause   We don t call each other names  We don t do it  And we don t use the least fortunate amongst us as punchlines for our jokes because they re our neighbors  They re our neighbors  And so  you re getting an opportunity to see the best side of America  And for the young people here  they maybe haven t seen a campaign like this because of COVID  because of things that s happening  This is a chance to bring out that joy  turn the page  and look to the future  this idea of going forward  so     applause   Doug    Doug is right  He told you my kids were backstage in awe  He didn t tell you they were probably in awe because they could not believe that I got through that thing and through that speech     laughter     that that was amazing to them  But I ll tell you what  they have felt part of this family  because they can feel the decency radiating off these people  They can see the commitment  They know that children matter  They know that family matters  They know that individuals matter  And this leader knows that it s not any of government s business to be in your health care decisions  Those are your decisions   Applause   And this is a leader who celebrates love in all forms that it comes by     applause     that we love each other  And for the young people  you hear somebody talking about this  We have the right to send our children to school to be free from being shot dead in their classrooms  That s what it is   Applause   And this is a nation    can ensure clean water  clean air  and a bright future for our children  So  I have to tell you  we ve got 79 days  And you ll hear me say this    Doug is going to correct me on this    I say   That s easy  We can sleep when we re dead   He s      laughter     Doug said we can sleep on November 6th after this election is over  so he may be right   Applause   But  look  coming into football country and being an old football coach  there s an old saying   You    you don t hope you re going to win  You prepare to win  And you give it the best you ve got  And you know when that game s over  you want to know you left it all on the field   And that s all we re asking  Let s leave it all on the field  Let s get this thing done  because     applause     because when my grandkids and your grandkids ask you about this    because on Nomber    November 6th  you were there  first time when you got to welcome madam president of the United States  Kamala Harris   Applause   THE VICE PRESIDENT  Tim Walz   Applause   Hey  everybody   Laughs   We re back  and we re going to keep coming back and we re going to keep coming back   Applause   I want to thank    I want to thank everybody  I want to start with Tim Walz  Isn t he fantastic   Applause   I like to call him Coach Walz  and  you know  he is    he s done so much for our country  and he s going to make an extraordinary vice president of the United States  Gwen  I mean  girl  just    you just killed it  I m telling you   Laughs   I mean  you know  there s something    I don t know    my first grade teacher  Mrs  Frances Wilson attended my law school graduation  I just love teachers  I think anyone who decides to become a teacher  it s just    it s    it s one of the greatest gifts that one has that they give  And I thank you  Gwen  for doing all that you have done  Thank you   Applause   And my husband is    Doug  you are doing so much and you ve been traveling all over our country  and I want to thank you  And you are going to  yet again  make history as the first gentleman of the United States   Laughs    Applause   There are a lot of incredible leaders here  I want to just  for a moment  mention my friend Bob Casey   Applause   You    we have got to send him back to the United States Senate  For the time that I was in the United States Senate and worked with Bob    I m going to tell you something  You know  we had these    we would have these meetings where all of the Democratic senators would get together for lunch  no cameras in the room  Bob  to     almost every time  was one of the ones who would stand up in that room with all the other senators from around the country talking about the working people of Pennsylvania and why we needed to have you in our mind when we were thinking about national policy every single day  That s who Bob Casey is  Let s send him back to the United States Senate   Applause   Chris Deluzio  we want to thank you   Applause   What he is doing in the halls of Congress    again  I mean  you send some fighters to D C   Pennsylvania  You sent some fighters to D C  Your next attorney general    DePasquale  where are you   Applause   I ve done that work  I know what it requires  and you re going to be outstanding  So  you ve got a lot of work  Pennsylvania  on your shoulders right now that you re carrying and you who are here volunteering to do this work  And it s    AUDIENCE MEMBER   Inaudible   THE VICE PRESIDENT  And we re going to get it done   Applause   And Malcolm Kenyatta knows exactly what I m talking about  I see him almost every time I come into the state  So  I want to just address you all right now  as the volunteers  You know  Tim said it  This campaign for us is really born out of love of country  We all here  we love our country  and we know our country is going to be as strong as our willingness to fight for it and to fight for what we stand for   Applause   You know  when you know what you stand for  you know what to fight for  When you stand for working people  you fight for working people  When you stand for freedom  whether it be to make decisions about your own body or love who you love  you fight for those things   Applause   When you believe in ending child poverty  you fight for that  When you believe in what we need to do to lift up the middle class  you fight for the middle class   Applause   These are the things we stand for  and these  therefore  are the things we fight for  And that s what our election is about  Our election is about understanding the importance of this beautiful country of ours in terms of what we stand for around the globe as a democracy    as a democracy  We know there s a duality to the nature of democracy  On the one hand  incredible strength when it is intact  what it does for its people to protect and defend their rights  their liberty  and their freedom    incredibly strong  And incredibly fragile  It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it  And that s what this campaign is about  This campaign is about a recognition that  frankly  over the last several years  there s been this kind of perversion that has taken place  I think  which is to suggest    AUDIENCE MEMBER   Inaudible   THE VICE PRESIDENT     which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down when  When what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up   Applause   That s what we see as strength  We know what strength looks like  That s what strength looks like   Applause   Anybody who s about beating down other people is a coward   Applause   This is what strength looks like  So  we know what we are about  We know what we stand for  And one of the beautiful things about these next 79 days is what the people in this room have already been doing and know  Let s build community  Let s reinforce community  You all  as volunteers  what you know    and we re going to spread the word    is how you can look at the face of a perfect stranger and see in their face a neighbor  that we see in each other our connection  our interdependence    what we see in each other    which fortifies and reinforces that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us  That s what this campaign is about  Yes  it is about winning  and we will win    and we will win    and we will win     applause     God willing  And through these next 79 days  we will continue to build community  build coalitions  and remind each other we are all in this together  So  I thank you all so very much for what you are doing   Applause   Now  let s get back to work  shall we   Laughs    Applause  ","","",""

USA  USA  USA  TRUMP  Thank you very much  Thank you  I really give a very big hello to Pennsylvania   cheers and applause  It s great to be back in this beautiful Commonwealth with thousands of proud  hard working American patriots  which is what you are  Think of this  Who would believe this  80 days from now  we are going to defeat a communist known as Kamala Harris  the most radical left person ever to run for office  This is not what this country needs  We ve had enough of them  We re going to win back the White House and we re going to take back our country   cheers and applause  Kamala Harris is a super left liberal who ruined San Francisco  ruined California  booing  and delivered a badly broken economy  a badly broken border  which gave us a dangerous world of chaos  death  and destruction  Just take a look at what s happening today  We were a respected country  Now the whole world laughs at us  We re a bunch of foolish people to have allowed this to happen  but we re going to bring it back  We re going to bring it back very fast  We ll close up the borders  We ll drill  baby drill   cheers and applause  We re going to do things that are going to be very good  very good  very fast  It ll happen very quickly  but she breaks everything that she touches  But soon we re going to fix every single problem Kamala Harris and Joe Biden  Crooked Joe have what happened to Biden  I was running against Biden  All of a sudden I m running against somebody else  It s true  You know  it s interesting  I said   Who am I running against    Harris   I said   Who the hell is Harris    You don t know  Who the hell is Harris    laughter  She was the first one out last time  She was the first one to lose  and now all of a sudden she s running  She never got a vote  They are a threat to democracy  remember that  Starting the day I take the Oath of Office  I will rapidly drive prices down and we will make America affordable again   cheers and applause  We re going to make it affordable again  Under Kamala Harris and crooked Joe Biden  the American dream was dead and it is dead  It s dead as a doornail  They ll never bring it back unless we win  If we win  we re going to have the American dream alive   cheers and applause  All for your beautiful children  your grandchildren  we ll have the American dream  will be back with us   cheers and applause  Her radical liberal policies  of course  horrific inflation decimated the middle class and gutted the finances of millions of American families  And you know what I m talking about because everybody in this room has been devastated by what they ve done  They have no idea  They re grossly incompetent people  Real incomes are down by over $2 000 a year  Think of that  Minimum  And ours  up five times that amount  more than five times that amount  Her price hikes have cost a typical household a total of $28 000  and that s called the Kamala Harris Inflation Tax  She was there for everything  You know when she sits and complains  hey  look  look  Joe Biden hates her  okay  hates her  You don t mind if I go off teleprompter for a second  do you   cheers and applause  Joe Biden hates her  This was an overthrow of a president  This was an overthrow  They went out and I spent a hundred million dollars fighting Joe Biden  They told him he couldn t win  His debate performance wasn t the best ever   laughter  but they said mine was the best ever  But they said his debate performance wasn t  I look forward to debating her  by the way  She ll be easier  she ll be easier than him   cheers  Her policies are so bad  Her policy  remember her father was a Marxist economic professor  He was a Marxist  an avowed Marxist  This is not what we want in this country  And think of it  Does anyone here feel richer under Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe  CROWD  NO TRUMP  Is anything less expensive under Kamala Harris or Crooked Joe  CROWD  NO TRUMP  No  no  It s been devastating  Inflation  Inflation has been devastating under this group of people that have no idea what the hell they re doing  Are you better off with Kamala and Biden than you were under President Donald J  Trump  I don t think so  They do polls and this stuff and I m at like 93   I said   Why are we having an election  They didn t have an election  Why are we having an election   How would you like to be Biden  He s working  He s spending money  He s trying  They wanted to have a debate  That s the thing that started it all  If I didn t debate him  he d still be running right now  But I believe she will be easier to beat than him  cheers and applause  because she s a truly radical left lunatic  And with him  he never really believed it  Of course  I don t know if he knew anything  I am not sure  But he didn t really believe it  She totally believes it  She wants to destroy our country  With four more years of Kamala  your finances will never recover  They will only get worse  They re only going to get worse  The stock market  and we have some of the most brilliant people on Wall Street saying the stock market is only up because they think I m going to win and if we don t win  according to many people  including one of the greatest Wall Street prognosticators  Scott Bessent has anyone heard of him  One of the most brilliant guys on Wall Street  if I don t win  you will have a 1929 style depression  Enjoy it  I believe that  I believe that  I believe it  A lot of people believe it  so we re not going to give them the chance  okay  We re not going to give them  And your state s going to be ruined anyway  she s totally anti fracking  She s been anti  fracking and anti drilling  anti oil and gas from practically the day she was born  All of a sudden a couple of months ago  she said   Oh  I d love to have fracking   No  she won t have fracking  Vote Trump and your incomes will soar  Your savings will grow  Young people will be able to afford a home   cheers  and we will bring back the American dream bigger   cheers and applause  We are going to bring it back  Bigger  better front row Joe  Bigger  better  and stronger than ever before  We re going to bring it back  Look at all these front row Joes over here  They ve only been  we have a couple of groups here  They re at about 222 events  Front Row Joes  stand up  wave your hands  there  you guys are great  Patriots   cheers and applause  But I have another group from a place called North Carolina  Has anybody ever heard of North  We love North Carolina  The beautiful ladies over there  This is number  what  217  so this is number 217  and supposedly they re happily married  How the hell does that work  Look at them   gestures towards crowd member  They re beautiful and they  oh  there s a husband  Are you a husband  Who are you married to husband  Oh  that was a wise choice  Beautiful  Very nice  How do you handle it  right  How do you handle  But they re great women and they ve been with us from the very beginning   cheers and applause  They were with us from the beginning in 2016 when we had the four greatest years this country has ever had  They were with us then  Thank you very much  North Carolina  We re doing well in North Carolina  Thank you  darling  It s nice to not have to travel to California and other places  right  Yesterday  Kamala laid out her so called economic plan  She says she s going to lower the cost of food and housing starting on day one  but day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago so why didn t she do it then   cheers  This is day 1 305  We re at 1 305  So why isn t she doing it now  Why doesn t she get away from her nice little place with her wonderful husband  go to Washington and do it now  You could do it right now  Why does she go to the convention  Because it s a rigged convention  obviously  She got no votes  He had 14  you know sleepy Joe had 14 million votes  She got no votes  She failed  She was the first one out  She failed  She never got to Iowa  Great state  Iowa  We re going to win it big  The farmers love Trump and I love the farmers  but she never got to Iowa  She was the first one to quit and now she s running for president   I don t know   Somebody s going to have to explain our system to our many enemies all around the world  They re watching  they re saying   This place doesn t make a lot of sense anymore   Everything Kamala Harris says in her speeches is a lie  She gets up and just lies  I was watching her yesterday  She talked about all the taxes I was going to raise  I never said that  I m lowering taxes  Yesterday she got up  She started ranting and raving that Donald Trump wants to put a tax on gasoline  a tax on food  a tax on medication  a tax on clothing  a tax on every single thing that was ever invented  Your hat  he s going to tax  Your shirt  he is going to tax  He s going to tax your wife  he s going to tax your husband  And I m saying  I never said any of that  They make it up  Here s the truth  Kamala wants to put massive taxes on American jobs and American industries  I want to cut taxes on Americans while putting tariffs on China and foreign countries to bring our jobs back home to Pennsylvania and to take in billions and billions of dollars   cheers and applause  I m the only one that ever took in any money from China  China was really hitting us hard  ripping us apart  that means many  many presidents  And what happened is I put a tariff on then I raised the tariff  We took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China and Biden gets so much money  he s trying to rescind it for a couple of reasons  Number one  he got a lot of money from China  Didn t he get three and a half million  4 million that they know of  But he got a lot more than that  His family made a lot of money with China  He wants to get rid of the tariff  but he can t because there s so much money they can t do anything with the budget  A tariff is a tax on a foreign country  That s the way it is  whether you like it or not  A lot of people like to say it s a tax on us  No  no  no  It s a tax on a foreign country  It s a tax on a country that s ripping us off and stealing our jobs and it s a tax that doesn t affect our country   cheers  And you could see hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs on other countries also  I took in hundreds of billions and nothing happened to us  They make less money  And you know what  Our jobs come back because there s no tax if they build their factory in Pennsylvania  there s no tax if they build their factory in the United States  So what do they do in order to avoid paying the tax  They say   Let s build a place over here  No tax   Come on over  We love it  Just hire our people  That s all you have to do  It s very simple  As we speak  and this really goes to Michigan more than you  but I look at Michigan and South Carolina  a lot of other places that do the auto stuff  and they are building some of the biggest auto factories in the world right now in Mexico  right off our border  They think they re going to make cars  not pay any tax and sell those cars into the United States  Not going to happen  Not with me  They re building some of the biggest auto plants in the world  And you know who owns those auto plants  They re built  They re made and being built in Mexico  You know who owns them  China owns them  China s very smart  I had a good relationship with President Xi  When Covid came  that was the end of that relationship  But I had a very good relationship  But we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China  Think of it  Bush  Barack Hussein did you ever hear of Barack Hussein Obama   booing  Have you heard of her   booing  There are those that think he is currently running the country  Does anybody think   booing  I don t know  I don t know that that s true  We know it s not Biden  Every attack Kamala makes on us is a fabricated  it s a lie  She s a bad storyteller  She doesn t know how to tell a story very well  but she gets caught  she got caught up in her own words  She s not a very good wordsmith they say  I don t know  We re going to find out  We re going to have a debate at some point  They gave me the worst network to me is ABC  worse than NBC  worse than CBS  worse than CNN  The home of George Stephanopoulos   a nasty guy  I said   George  I ve had you up to here   It s true  He s a nasty guy  The hatred  And yet when he interviews Biden  two weeks ago  he interviewed Biden  it was like the nicest interview   What flavor ice cream do you like    George  I tend to vanilla very much    laughter  With me they get into a lot of subjects that a lot of people don t like talking about  But ABC is the worst  And that seems because they won t do it on Fox  They ve turned down the Fox  I ve approved three debates  They ve approved one  The only one they ve approved was their network  And now it came out in the New York Times of all places that the head of the news and the head of the whole thing practically is Kamala and her husband  lovely husband  best friend  her and her husband are best friends with Kamala and her husband  And I m supposed to do the debate  But with Biden  they thought I wouldn t do it so they offered me something that I couldn t accept  They said   The debate is at CNN in front of no audience   So far  I m oh for two  And see  they didn t want to do the debate  That would ve been a good idea if they didn t do it  but I was going to accept anything  Then I guess we ll do it here too  right  We ll accept anything because otherwise she s not going to debate  She doesn t want to debate  but they said   CNN and no audience  and we want to have you sit down   I objected to that  They wanted us sitting behind the desk  I said   Give me a break  We have to at least stand for the American public   Wouldn t that be nice   cheers and applause  That was the only thing  and I would ve done it if they insisted  No  I would ve sat down if they insisted  But I thought it was sort of a little strange  But I had Dana Bash and I had Jake Tapper  But I have to tell you  they were very fair  I really thought they were very fair  Jake and Dana  nobody knows how to say her first name  Is it Dana or Dana  Nobody knows  It s been going on for 20 years  She s been around a long time  Is it Dana or Dana  And now the fake news will say   Trump didn t know how to pronounce her first name   She doesn t know how to pronounce  but look  but Dana and Jake  I used to call him Fake Tapper  Now I call him Jake Tapper because he treated us very fairly and so did Dana treat me very fairly  I think it was just about neutral  But he kept saying he gave very short answers because he wasn t really doing too well  And I kept saying   I ll take it   But what happened   Sir  you have 92 seconds left   This is not what he wanted to hear   gestures to David McCormick  Right  David  They said   You have 92 seconds left   going to be your next senator I ll tell you  David McCormick   cheers and applause  I hope you can vote for him  I hope you vote for him  I hope you vote for him  He is a great gentleman  great hero actually in many ways  He s a great guy  But so they gave me this thing and they assumed I was going to turn it down so I have the wrong network  I have the wrong anchors  I have no audience  I like an audience  I love people   cheers and applause  It s oftentimes a mistake  Everything was wrong  So what we ll do is we ll offer him this thing that he can t accept  He won t accept it  And then we ll say   Trump didn t accept the debate  He s afraid to negotiate against Biden because Biden is so sharp  He s so sharp  He s sharp like a razor   But I surprised them  I said   I ll take it  I ll take it   And people said   Are you crazy   I said   Look  it s the only way you re going to debate  If we do anything else  they re not going to accept it   And these people are the same way  They offered me   we  we were supposed to have Fox on September 4th  And they said   No   I accepted it  I don t even know what s going to happen because I ve accepted it  They haven t  So maybe they show up  maybe they don t  But I think it s sort of on for September 4th  but I don t think they re going to come  And then we go and we do the debate with ABC  ABC  again  I call it ABC Fake News  so bad  They re so bad  They re so dishonest  in my opinion  Very dishonest people  But I find them to be the worst  And I really am a professional at this because I watch the who treats me the worst  Now  NBC is horrible  CBS is horrible  They re all horrible  These are horrible human beings  But who treats me the worst  ABC Fake News treats me the worst  And that s where they want it  Where her best friend it just came out the other day  Nobody told anybody about this  is the head of the whole deal  right  But I ll probably say   I ll take it  because you know what they re not going to do a debate  But just remember  these are phony  fake  disgusting people that hate our country   cheers  Remember that  And also remember that every attack that we make on Kamala is something that she said on tape or something that she s actually done  All of these attacks are things because she said all of it  She said   I don t want fracking in Pennsylvania   She said it hundreds of times   I don t want it anywhere   then a couple of months ago  when the polls are showing that she s getting clobbered  well actually  nobody actually thought they were politically correct  They wanted to be politically correct because they wanted  they had 11 different people and they put her name in to be number 12  and they had a vote  She came in last  So she picked somebody  think of it  how about the guy she picked  how bad is he  right  How bad is that guy  David  where do these people come from   cheers and applause  He recently signed a bill in a state that I love  but a state that hasn t been won by a Republican because it s a corrupt state  but the people are not corrupt  The people are great  Since 1972 hasn t been won  And I thought we won it twice  I said   There s no way we lose Minnesota   But he signed a bill for all young men s bathrooms and men s bathrooms  have to be equipped with a tampon selling machine   booing  And she turned down  your governor  by the way  just so you understand  I know some of you probably like him   booing  I don t think he s a good person  I don t think he s good  I don t think he s good  But they turned him down because he s Jewish  Okay  That s why they turned him down  Now we can be politically correct and not say that  I could say   Well  they turned him down for various reasons   No  no  They turned him down because he s Jewish  that s why they turned him down  And I ll tell you this  any Jewish person that votes for her or a Democrat has to go out and have their head examined because if you see what s happening with Israel and Jewish people right now  there has never been a more dangerous time since the Holocaust  If you happen to be Jewish in America  there s never been anything like it  I m seeing things  I can t even believe it  and we want to bring about unity and peace and everything else  It looks like they re going to have nothing but riots out there in Chicago  It s really a sad thing  But they turned him down for that reason and they turned him down for a couple of other reasons too  But the primary reason was that he s Jewish  And you don t think I know what goes on in their campaign  I know it well  I know it very well  She s a nation wrecker who is more liberal than crazy Bernie Sanders  You know Crazy Bernie  He s pretty bad  right  She is substantially more radicalized than Crazy Bernie  You cannot have her as your president  She ruined San Francisco  She ruined the state of California  No  she was a district attorney  and she was the attorney general of the state  I heard the other day  and this isn t anything  I m just saying they ll say   He was rambling   I don t ramble  I m really smart guy  really smart  I don t ramble  But the other day  anytime I hit too hard  they say he was rambling  Rambling  I get up and I make a speech  I go for sometimes two hours  two and a half hours  because people are waiting outside for three days  four days  You guys were waiting out there for a long time  Front row Joes are waiting out I don t know how you guys do it  And I feel I have an obligation to speak  and speak in a certain way  and speak a little bit longer  You know  How would you like it  A guy s waiting with his family for three and a half  four days  They have a tent  and the tent is set up  They have hundreds of them  and they wait  And then I walk in  speak for 15 minutes  and leave  I don t know  somehow  would that be okay  North Carolina  I don t think so  right  CROWD  NO TRUMP  They want me to speak all day  When I leave  I did one  two hours and 15 minutes  and I m leaving  and they re screaming   No  sir  more  We want to hear more   I said   I can t   I said   I can t speak more  What the hell else am I going to say  Our country s going to hell  That s all I can say  We re a nation in decline   You know we were talking about that before  My phrases are copied so much  right  I use the term  oftentimes in closing   We are a nation in decline  We are a failed nation   And I think it s a beautiful phrase  although I don t like the topic very much  I don t like what it represents  but there s a certain beauty  All of a sudden  all of these candidates  including Republicans  are saying   We are a nation in decline  We are a failing nation   And I say  You know  what the hell do they have to copy me for  Right  But they have a lot of words that they copy  many of our words  We were in the plane before coming in  and our people said we went through a list  I think we re going to release a list  Let s release it  But so many of our phrases  they copy  Really  that should be a nice thing  Not an insult  But crazy Bernie Sanders has said a lot of things  and one of the things he s arguing about is who s more liberal  And after about two minutes  he gave up  He said   This woman is nuts   Look  people say be nice  Have you heard her laugh  That is the laugh of a crazy person  That is the laugh of a crazy  It s the laugh of a lunatic   cheers and applause  Have you heard it  You know  they prohibited her  They prohibited her for laughing  I ve been waiting for her to laugh  because as soon as she laughs  the election s over  But we re winning by a lot in Pennsylvania  I think the fracking got her   cheers and applause  The fracking got her  But she has been prohibited from laughing  She used to do an interview  she d go ha ha ha  Who the hell laughs at an interview like that  I m interviewed all the time  I may smile  They re asking you questions about things that It s not like a comedy club  And she d break out  That s one of the reasons she refuses to do interviews  I think  because she laughs  it s so horrible  No  it s so horrible  But you know she hasn t done an interview in 30 days or something like that  And I do one every day  If I pass I just did one backstage   cheers and applause  I just did one backstage with a very good reporter  But you re supposed to  Don t you sort of have an obligation  You know you re running  They re going to try  This is her form of the basement  Now  the basement for him was good because they had COVID  they didn t want him to catch COVID  he ended up catching it anyway  But uh the whole system is very dishonest  but she should be at least talking to the press  She hasn t done anything  But she s prohibited from laughing  They said   Your laugh is horrible  Never laugh  ever   So  she s walking around with her mouth almost sealed shut  She won t laugh  I want her to laugh  And then we ll just claim victory  Ladies and gentlemen  like to thank you very much  But we have a little video that we just put up  Would you like to see it  CROWD  YES TRUMP  Go ahead  Just one  KAMALA HARRIS  montage of clips from Harris s statements   Yeah  I am a radical  You need to get radical about what we re doing  and take it seriously  As president of the United States  I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal  There s no question  I m in favor of banning fracking  We have to have a buyback program  and I support a mandatory buyback program  JAKE TAPPER  I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance  HARRIS  Let s eliminate all of that  ERIN BURNETT  But would you support changing the dietary guidelines  HARRIS  Yes  BURNETT  You know  the food pyramid  HARRIS  Yes  BURNETT  To reduce red meat specifically  HARRIS  Yes  I would  INTERVIEWER 1  Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants  EBRO DARDEN  Where do you stand on defund the police  HARRIS  This whole movement is about rightly saying we need to take a look at these budgets  UNNAMED COMMENTATOR 1  Harris asserted that ICE is perceived as the modern day Ku Klux Klan  HARRIS  Are you aware that there s a perception  UNNAMED SPEAKER 1  I see no  HARRIS  Are you aware that there s a perception  SPEAKER 1   perception that puts ICE in the same category as the KKK  Is that where you re asking me  I see no parallel  HARRIS  I m not finished  SPEAKER 1  I see none  HARRIS  Maybe I am a radical  We need to get radical about what we are doing  CROWD  BOO TRUMP  Now  over the years  and right up until the present  she wanted to openly defund the police  How do you like that  CROWD  BOO TRUMP  In Minnesota  when they were burning down the state  and in particular Minneapolis  they were burning it down  Remember the CNN fake reporter  He got up the one with the nice  shaved head  he got up   This is a peaceful rally  This is a rally of love   Behind him  the entire city was burning  It looked like World War II  right  And by the way  speaking of World War II  she will bring us into World War III  and it will be that ll be a war like never before  because of the weaponry  No more army tanks going back and forth shooting  We ve left a lot of our   you know  I rebuilt the entire military  and we left a lot of that in a place called Afghanistan  You know that  Billions and billions of dollars  we left it  In the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country  we left billions of dollars  13 great soldiers killed  Think of it  Left many hostages  Many people have been left behind  But think of what happened there  We got out in disgrace  We should have gotten out with strength  I was getting out  We would ve been out even sooner  but strength  dignity  we would ve kept Bagram  The big air base  You know who occupies Bagram right now  China  Because it was one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons  Not because of Afghanistan  but because of China  But China occupies it right now  Thank you very much  President Xi  enjoy our billions of dollars of construction that took place years ago  They spent billions of dollars many years ago  One hour away  think of that  where they make their nuclear weapons  It s so embarrassing  the stupidity of the people that have run our country  But we did things the opposite way  We were very smart  we were very respected  we were a respected country  They respected your leader  elected leader  But remember this  Viktor Orban of Hungary  prime minister of Hungary  they asked him pretty recently  they said   What s going on  The world is coming to an end   He said   If you want to stop it  reelect the United States  reelect Donald Trump   cheers and applause  Because when he was there  he didn t have any problems  We didn t have problems   Russia wouldn t have happened with Ukraine  Israel would ve never been attacked on October 7th  never  You know Iran was broke  Iran was broke  They had no money  I told China   You buy oil from them  you can t deal with us   I told that to many countries  anybody that dealt there  so they didn t buy oil  Oil s the whole thing  the big deal  And they were broke  Now they have $3 billion  think of it  They have $300 billion now  they have plenty of money  We re run by stupid people  and we have to change it  or we re not going to have a country left  We didn t let countries take advantage of us  France was going to charge our corporations tremendous amounts of money for doing business in France  You know this  David  David is very familiar with what happened  And I went to my people  I said   Tell them we re not going to put up with it  They re not going to charge our companies  because we want our companies to do well so they can employ people   It s sort of simple  I didn t even like a lot of the companies that they were dealing with  I should have said   Oh  great  let them charge  What the hell do I care   But they re American companies  And I said to Macron  I said   Call him  because my people failed to make a deal   I said   You make a deal  you have one week  Come see me   At the end of a week  they came to see me  Good people  smart people  very smart people  Secretary of Treasury  smart guy  Mnuchin  others  They came back to see me   Sir  we re not able to make a deal  They re going to charge our companies a tax   I said   No  no  they re not going to do it  You don t understand  They re not going to do it  Come back and see me  You have one more day   They came back   Sir  they won t do it  They ve already passed it in their so called legislature  We re not going to do it  They re not going to be able to stop it  sir   I said   We ll stop it  Get Emmanuel Macron on the phone   I got him on the phone   Emmanuel  how are you  So nice to talk    Oh  Donald  Donald  it is so nice to speak to you   It s beautiful  I wish"," I had his accent  I would ve been president 20 years ago  But I said   Emmanuel  I understand you re charging our companies a lot of money    Oh  well  this has been in the works for many years  you know Donald  Yes  it is done  it is really done  There s nothing we can do about it   I said   Okay  good  Emmanuel  here s the story  If you don t get rid of that tax within 24 hours  starting on Monday morning   it was a Friday   I m going to charge every bottle of wine and champagne that you send into our country  I m going to charge you a tariff of 100  on every bottle  and you will not be sending too many bottles of champagne    cheers and applause  And he said   Donald  Donald  that is not fair  That is not fair   I said   No  no  It s not fair for you to be charging American companies to do business in your country  No  it s not fair  Emmanuel  Emmanuel  get back to me in five minutes and let me know   He called me back in two minutes  He said   Donald  we have decided that we will not be charging you any taxes for the American companies    cheers and applause  I did so many of them  I did so many  I could stand up here all day and tell you different stories  I just used the telephone  I could stop the war with a telephone  I could stop what s happening in the Middle East with a couple of telephone calls  properly placed   cheers and applause  Horrible  Horrible  horrible  horrible  We have people that are babies  In many ways  I guess they re stupid  People say   Please don t use bad language  Please don t call people stupid   They re stupid people  How else do you describe it  I want to use a different word  highly a more sophisticated word than stupid  but there s no word  It s a perfect word  They re stupid people  I think they re also  by the way  if I might  they re also corrupt  They really are  they re corrupt  They get a lot of money from a lot of people  We re not going to let this socialist lunatic and she s a socialist lunatic  That s the other thing   Please  sir  Please don t call her a lunatic   I said   But that s what she is   She s a lunatic   cheers and applause  She s a lunatic  She s going to destroy our country  And she s going to break our economy even more than it s broken  We have a broken economy  Our supply chain is gone  You order something now  I don t know how many of you are in business  or even if you re ordering as a personal order  the order doesn t come  The supply chain is broken  Whoever thought of it  we never even talked about supply chain  Supply chain just worked  And because of what they ve done  they ve broken our supply chain  On election day  we re going to tell her that we ve had enough  We said   Kamala  you re a horrible vice president  you re going to be a horrible president  We re not going to take it anymore  KAMALA  you re fired  Get out of there  You re fired    cheers and applause  Not going to take it anymore  Kamala   cheers and applause  CROWD  USA  USA  USA  TRUMP  We re not going to take it anymore  We have a country to save  And how about the fake news   gestures towards media  Oh  look at them all back here  look at all those cameras   booing  TRUMP  Look at all those cameras  Wow  Look at all those cameras  all those fake writers  Look at them   booing  Time Magazine  think of this  Time Magazine doesn t have a picture of her  They have this unbelievable artist drawing her  And I said   Is that Sophia Loren   I couldn t who might that be  Is that Elizabeth Taylor  They say she was a beautiful woman  Who is it  It s so beautiful  Drawing  It s a drawing  They took a lot of pictures  it didn t work out  so they hired a sketch artist  I said   I m sure  oh  they must be celebrating the great life and times of the magnificently beautiful Sophia Loren   And you re not allowed to say this anymore  You know  David  don t ever get caught in this trap  David  please  Don t ever call a woman beautiful  because that ll be the end of your political career  Please  I want to make your life much easier  David  By the way  he s also got a great wife  I have to say  he s got a great wife   applause  But you know  I read a so called Republican  who Ronald Reagan didn t like  by the way  and she didn t like him  but she got credit for being this Reagan speech writer  Highly overrated  I don t know anything about her  I don t know her  Treats me badly  but that s okay  She called it wrong  She s called it wrong now for about eight years  But she said one thing that got me  She said Kamala has one big advantage  She s a very beautiful woman   laughter  CROWD  BOO TRUMP  She s a beautiful woman  So  I decided to go back and reread the clause   I m not saying he s    but I say that I am much better looking than her   cheers and applause  I think I m much better  much better  I m a better looking person than Kamala  No  I couldn t believe it  I had never heard that one  They said   No  her biggest advantage is that she s a beautiful woman   I m going   Huh   I never thought of that  I m better looking than she is   cheers  In her speech yesterday  Kamala went full communist  You heard that  She went full communist  She wants to destroy our country  After causing catastrophic inflation  Comrade Kamala announced that she wants to institute socialist price controls  You saw that  Never worked before  Never ever worked  This is the Maduro plan  Venezuela Maduro plan of the old Soviet Union  They tried it  How did the Soviet Union work out  It became Russia  smaller version  It was a smaller version  It will cause rationing  hunger  and skyrocketing prices  just like their Inflation Reduction Act caused  One of the great scams of all time  They got it approved with a beautiful name  Inflation Reduction  Because inflation  under their system  has been so bad  It s gone up much more than 50   They say   30  40  50   Much more  People are being devastated  They re being devastated  But it s gone way up  way up  And they made a big mistake yesterday in her speech  I think she said  I had to play it back  I love the playback controls you have nowadays  They used to call it TiVo  now they have TiVo  all the I think it s the single greatest invention  It s better than television  because television would drive you crazy if you couldn t do a playback  right  Now I can playback  I heard the statement  and I heard that statement that she made  and she made a statement yesterday that  from her time in office  essentially  prices have gone up by 50   something like I said   Did she just say that   I said   That speech writer is going to be fired   In fact  we took that section and we actually made a commercial on it  and we got the best commercial of the week  and we didn t do anything  We just played her back  But here s the problem  The things that she said yesterday don t work  They have never worked  They ve never been used  Many times before  in many other countries  they ve never worked  They ve just never worked  They ve been used oftentimes  many countries  and in every single event  it ruined those countries  It s a communist system  It s what her father  a Marxist  he was a Marxist  it s what her father taught her  from a young girl growing up  She s promising to hand out things she can t deliver  She can never deliver them  she ll never get them approved  Just like when she and Crooked Joe tried to give away student debt  Remember  She wanted to pay  How did that work out  Not too good  The students are saying   I love him because of student debt   But he got rejected  And this will be rejected even more so because what they re doing is a communist takeover of our country  Her plan is very dangerous  because it may sound good politically  and that s the problem  And we have to be very careful  because when somebody gets up and says   We re going to give you everything  $25 000 for a house  we re going to give you all sorts of little goodies  free healthcare  we re going to give you everything  universal healthcare   Sounds so beautiful  And I told my people  you got to be very careful  I told the Republican Party  you have to be very careful  She s giving all this away  and somebody that really isn t into it  We re largely  even groups like this  we re into it  We think about it all the time  We want to take back our country  We want to save our country  And you understand how bad this stuff is  This is communist  this is Marxist  this is fascist  But you know what  It s dangerous because she s saying that she s going to give away things that she ll never be able to get approved  She wants to increase the number of justices on the United States Supreme Court to 27  27  booing  I used to hear she was going up to 11  and then I heard it was 13  But then they said that s an unlucky number  so they went to 15  Yesterday for the first time  I heard 27  We ll have to rebuild the entire Supreme Court  because they won t have enough room for the judges  They won t have enough   And by the way  how courageous were our justices of the United States Supreme Court   cheers and applause  What they did  they re saving our country  They re actually saving our country  What they ve done is they ve passed things that were so important  and they did it for the right  not for the wrong  They did the right thing  They did the right thing  And I just have such respect for them  The job they ve done against and the radical left plays the ref  You know the great Bobby Knight  He supported me  He used to fight with the referees all the time  Scream at them   Bobby  Bobby  please don t do that  It s not going to work   He said   You re right  it s not going to work now  it s going to work for the next one   And the next call  there d be a flagrant foul and they wouldn t call it  They didn t want to get screamed at  The radical left harasses our judges  and harasses our justices  They scream at them  They call them names  They say they re incompetent  They re horrible  They re this  they re that  They should be impeached  They re constantly saying they should be impeached  But they re screaming  And you know what  It has an effect on some people  But so far  they ve been very strong  It s really horrible  I believe it s illegal  what they do  And I m trying to give you things that you ve never heard before  and this is true  I believe they are playing the ref  They re constantly criticizing our great  some of our greatest  justices  and a lot of great judges  I kept hearing so much about the Florida case  because you know they weaponized our system  Our government totally weaponized it  First time it s ever happened  And they said my biggest case is in Florida  Florida  Florida  We had a very brilliant  I don t know the judge  but a fair and very brilliant judge  who took tremendous abuse  Would ve been so easy for her to just rule against me  But she didn t do that  She ruled for threw out the whole case   cheers and applause  It was thrown out  That was a big case  And I have such respect for her because she is  in fact  brilliant  But they were hitting her so hard   She s going too slow  She s not  she should be removed immediately from office   These people are horrible  I really think it s illegal  what they do with judges and justices  They re playing the ref  No different than Bobby Knight  And he was great  He endorsed me  and Indiana was mine  he was a great coach  He s the last coach to go undefeated  I guess he was like 38   For some reason  they ve never had another college team since then  That was many years ago  And he came out in favor of Donald Trump  and it was a big thing  I won Indiana by a landslide  Because when Bobby Knight from Indiana endorses you  you win   cheers  Sort of like when I endorse you  you win too  We have a very good record of endorsement  But we can t let these radical left thugs constantly scream at our judges and say   We re going to impeach him  We re going to take him out of office   Or her   We re going to do horrible things to him   Continuous  When you heard Schumer get up on the stairs of the courthouse  Supreme Court  and talk about Kavanaugh   We re going to get you  Kavanaugh  We re going to hit you   Or whatever the hell he said  If a mobster said that  they d be put in jail immediately  He frankly should have been put in jail  or certainly spoken to very strongly   cheers and applause  He got lucky  He got lucky  He had a couple of guys that didn t want to do it  and I understand that also  But he got lucky  But we can t let them do that  And I just want to pay my respect to the judges that have suffered abuse at the hands of the radical left lunatics  And I really admire them for because you know what  All they have to do to end it is rule against me or whatever it is  If they say   Trump  you re guilty   Oh  now all of a sudden they say   Oh   That s the last time they ever say a bad but they can t do it  because these people have weaponized the Justice Department  including local DAs and local attorney generals  And Fani  Fani  You know Fani  Spelled F A N I   My name is Fani  F A N I   I don t figure it  She put a little French accent on the word with her lover  Wade  Right  Lover Wade  we call him  Lover Boy Wade  She hired and paid him almost a million dollars because of his great knowledge of the law  He never did it before  With us today is Daniel Campos  a pilot in Venezuela who now lives in Pennsylvania  Great gentleman  Daniel came to tell us what you think of Kamala Harris leading our country into socialism  We re being led into socialism  but the socialism will be short lived  It s going into communism  If you would ve told me  and if you remember many times during State of the Unions  I would say   We will never have a socialist country   And everybody would applaud  But I was right because we re really  I think  skipping socialism  We re going into communism  When they weaponize our government like this  that s what they do in Third World countries  That s what they do in South American horror shows  That s what they do in banana republics  They ve weaponized it  But I believe ours is even more corrupt  The New York court system is totally corrupt  They use the state and the city to go after me  They take top people in the Department of Justice and put them in  The Attorney General Leticia James  she campaigned  and   I will get Trump   And they then go there  and then they go into the Manhattan DA s office  They use Hillary Clinton s lawyer and the Democrats  law firm to leave the firm and go into the DA s office in order to prosecute Donald Trump  free of charge  They re not going to charge  Then he writes a book  this guy writes a book  before the thing even went anywhere  And in the book he said   I do it for free  it s so great   These are corrupt people  and we have to call them out  So  remember the term  playing the ref with our judges and our justices should be punishable by very serious fines and beyond that   cheers and applause  But I d like to ask  because because we re into that whole system  And I d like to call up Daniel  Please come up and tell us about your experience in living in a country that went very  very bad  went radical left  and the experience has not been good  Please come up  Thank you  Hi  Daniel   cheers and applause  DANIEL CAMPOS  Thank you  I m so pleased to meet you  TRUMP  How are you  Appreciate it  Nice to see you  Please  CAMPOS  Okay  All right  First of all  hi  everybody  Thank you for coming here and supporting the president   cheers and applause  I m going to say the first part of the speech  well  of my story  in English  then I m going to repeat it in Spanish in order to allow our Latino voters to understand and hear what the situation is going on   cheers and applause  First of all  as the president already said  I m from Venezuela  I left the country in 2007 because of communism  I still have family there  There s been family that has left even before me  or continues leaving little by little  But going farther back  my grandparents from my mom s side were from Cuba  They were at university when the communist revolution was going on  and they ended up leaving to Venezuela  They only have the money they received for as their wedding present  and they were living in a mid house  going to school  and trying to move  you know  ahead  My granddad ended up becoming a doctor  and had a family  raising three children  my mom and my two uncles  when  in the early 1990s  Chavez did a military coup  And right after he run for president  my granddad saw the similarities to what was happening in Cuba  and he told everybody that would listen to him that it was coming  And everybody was like   No  this is Venezuela  This is not Cuba  This will never happen to us   And guess what  It happened to us and has been happening to other Latin American countries as well  TRUMP   points down  Right here  CAMPOS  So when they tell you here  it will never happen  that s not true  We lived it  Now here we are  So  in 2007  we ended up leaving because the socialists and the government  they start changing the education system to make it more like the Cuban education system  It might ring a bell to what s going on here as well  So  it s extremely important for everybody to keep this in mind  And if you don t mind  I m going to switch to Spanish for our Latino speakers   cheers and applause  TRUMP  Yeah  good job  CAMPOS  Thank you  Para todos latinomericanos  gracias por venir aquí  soportar Presidente Trump  Es importante que entendamos que lo que ha pasado en otro países en Latinoamerica puede pasar aquí  Como mencioné  mi abuela mi abuelos son de Cuba  Se fueron por el comunismo  llegaron a Venezuela sin ninguna base  solo un poco dinero salieron adelante y se mi abuelo se convirtió en doctor y crió mi madre y mis dos tios  Cuando Chavez hizo el atentado perdón el golpe de estado y duespués corrió por president  Mi abuelo trató de advertir al todo el mundo que eso es exactamente como Cuba  Nadie le hizo cazo   Que paso  Chavez entró y veinte años duespués  aqui estamos  Tiene que recordar  que si paso en un lugar  puede pasar aquí también  No crean que porque Estados Unidos  gran economia  no puede pasar  Puede pasar y vamos encaminados al menos que tomemos un paso differente y yo por esto pienso que Trump es la major persona para ser lo  Going back in English  that we are going on a path that is taking us to what Venezuela became  and the only way right now that we can avoid keep going down that path is making Trump president again   cheers and applause  Thank you  It s a pleasure   cheers and applause  TRUMP  Have you done that before  CAMPOS  No  TRUMP  Oh  wow  Thank you  Daniel  CROWD  USA  USA  USA  USA  TRUMP  Great  CROWD  USA  USA  USA  USA  TRUMP  What a fantastic job  I said   Have you done that before   He said   No  sir   You are something   cheers and applause  All right  What office is he going to run for  I think we re going to endorse him so fast   cheers and applause  Thank you very much  No  it s such a problem because it s a very dangerous situation  She s giving everybody free everything  It s never going to happen  Remember the college debt  the student debt they were going to give  It never happened  It was just all talk  Then he said  after getting totally rejected he came up with another plan  which is even dumber  But what happens is they talk  These things will never happen  but it s very dangerous because politically maybe somebody says   Oh  that s great  That s great   It s the end of our country  We can t do it  We can t do it  So  I really appreciate that  That was beautiful  That was so well done  Amazing  Thank you   cheers and applause  In addition to defeating Kamala Harris  you need to defeat your terrible Democrat Senator Bob Casey   booing  You know I ve been there  I ve been in Washington for a long time  I mean  I barely met the guy  Most of these guys I get to meet in one form or another  for better or worse  I hardly know this guy  I never really remember meeting him  He obviously created a great impression  But he s not a hard worker  He s cruising on his father s past  I met the father  I think I knew the father better than I knew the son  But Bob Casey voted for every bill that caused the worst inflation in the history of our country  in my opinion  They call it decades  but I believe it s the history of our country because they re not using the real things  Like  mortgage rates went from 2  to 10   They don t say that  That s inflation  They don t say that  And you can t get any money at 10  either  We had it down to two and 2 4  2 5   and now you can t get the money at 10   They don t have any money  He voted to open borders and the war on Pennsylvania energy  You know  Bob Casey voted against all of this stuff  against your state  but you don t know because you have other jobs  You re not watching Bob Casey  That s why you need to fire Bob Casey  and you have to elect a man named David McCormick for the U S  Senate  Dave is strong on borders  great on taxes  He wants to reduce your taxes  All my life  I ve been involved  usually from the other side  it s called writing checks  but I ve been involved  I ve made lots of contributions to politicians all my life  And politicians always talked about   We will lower your taxes   That s all they talked about is lowering tax  This is the only group I ve ever seen where they say   We are going to increase your taxes   I ve never heard of it before  And by four times  I gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country  and bigger than the Reagan tax cuts  And they expire in a few months  and they want to not renew them  If that s the case  you re going to pay four times the tax that you re paying right now  And then they  on top of that  want to increase your taxes to pay for the green new scam  You know what the green new scam is  CROWD MEMBER  YEAH TRUMP  The oceans will rise one eighth of an inch over the next 400 years  but they don t talk about a madman that s building nuclear missiles right now  That s your real global warming  It s not this  Your global warming is war  Your global warming is going to be nuclear weapons  Nobody talks about that  They don t ever mention it  but they talk about an ocean that s rising  which will give you slightly more beachfront property if it happens  Now  think of it  But they don t talk about somebody that s got very evil intentions  Look at Iran  I stopped them from building a nuclear weapon  but this guy is going to give it up   cheers and applause  He s going to give it up  So  David McCormick  And I ve known him for a long time  he s an amazing man  a tremendous education  tremendous military background  and he s a very strong guy  and he loves the state  I really hope you give him a chance  It s not easy  And I was just talking to him  A guy s been in office for years  He s done nothing  He s done nothing  In that way  it s good  but in another way  it s tough because you ve seen his name a little bit  You don t even see his name  Most people don t even know  If you asked   Who are the senators   they may choose the one that didn t do so well in a debate but won  right  He didn t do too well in a debate  I wonder who did worse in the debate  Biden or him  I think maybe Biden did  I think  actually  CROWD MEMBER  Fuck Joe Biden  TRUMP  he s made more sense than a lot of other people over the last few months  in all fairness  He actually has  I commend him on that  But nobody knows about Casey  Nobody knows about him  even though he s been there for years  His father was there for years  I just want to ask  It s very important because we want to turn our country around  We need to get great representation even beyond the presidency  And this is a dead seat  It s a seat that voted with this group of people  Barack Hussein Obama  and Biden  and her  because she was a part of it  She s now trying to claim that she has nothing to do with Biden  She had nothing to do with the administration  They put him on  Now  maybe they change it  because I said this a couple of days ago  Usually  when I say something  they immediately change it so I can t say it anymore  but they gave him speaking on Monday night  Now  have they changed it  I don t think so  Monday night is considered  on a convention  Death Valley  It s Death Valley  because people aren t watching Monday night  So  they deposed a president  It was a coup of a president  This was a coup  Nancy Pelosi  Crazy Nancy  she s crazy as a bed bug  Crazy Nancy went in and laid it out  And she never thought he was good  because she s smart  cunning  nasty  mean  but she s crazy  And she went in and she said   You re getting out   And he said   No  I m not  Only God will get me out   Right  Isn t that what he said   Only God   And within about 24 hours  he announced that he was going to get out  And he won it  He went through a primary system  She didn t  He beat her in the primary  She ran along with 22 people  She ran  She was the first one out because she was no good  She was no good  And now she s running  And this is not what our country s all about  And he feels terrible  and he s a very angry man  I watched him yesterday  He s a very angry man  I think he hates them more than he hates Donald Trump  and that s hard to believe  I really do  He s an angry man  and he should be an angry man  They walked in and they stole the presidency of the United States from him  Now  I think he was a terrible president  I think he was the worst president in the history of our country  I think that Jimmy Carter is the happiest man on Earth today  He s not a young man  Because Jimmy Carter s presidency was brilliant  brilliant by comparison to this  But she was a big part of it  and she s going to be an even bigger part  Now she wants to give her a whole country away  And just as Daniel and others have said  I mean  its  its our country s going to die  and yet it s scary because she s given so much away  I mean  who s not going to vote to get some money for House  It s never going to happen  It s trillions of dollars  It s never going to happen  But who s going to vote  I mean  people will maybe vote for this  I said before  it may be good politics  but it s going to destroy our country  The Washington Post  one of the most evil print journalism  I mean  they ve lost a lot of people over the last couple of years  it s nasty  they came out with an editorial excoriating her  Actually  I spoke with Jeff Bezos just for almost the first time  I met him once before  And he was so complimentary on the way we handled the horrible situation that took place recently  and I appreciated that  But we talked a little bit about the paper  And their radical left paper  they excoriated her in today s editorial  Excoriated her  And I give The Washington Post tremendous credit  I believe The New York Times did  or is about to do  the same thing  But when they re going after somebody because they re far  far it s not even left  Every single country that s done this it s been done many times because it s so easy to say   I m going to give you this  I m going to give you that  We re going to put price controls on food   How do they do that  We re going to say   The beans are going to cost this  Cereal s going to   It doesn t work  And what happens is you end up with huge inflation and no product because you can t make it anymore  because they lose money hand over fist  So  it doesn t work  But it s scary because sometimes people vote for it because it sounds good  It sounds good  but it s really bad  We re going to give you tax cuts   cheers and applause  We re going to give you additional tax cuts  We made our country wealthy  We made our country better than it had ever been before  and we did it  We did it  The big difference is we had a man serving for three and a half years with her at his side  and we had us  And prior  we did a great job on COVID  never got the credit  I got great credit for the economy  in all fairness to the fake news  I got great credit for the economy  great credit for the military  We defeated ISIS  We had no new wars  We rebuilt our military  Think of that  We came up with a new and very important organization  to put it mildly  first time since the Air Force  almost 80 years  Space Force  and we took space  where we were languishing to China  falling way behind China and Russia  we took space  and now we re dominating them  We put some incredible people in there  Space Force has been so important  It ll end up being one of our truly important already is  I mean  it s coordinating with but we created Space Force  We did so many things  Right to Try medically  Right to Try  If you re terminally ill  you had no right to get medicine  Now you sign a document  They tried to get that for 58 years  58 years they were unable to get it  I sat everybody down  the labs  the doctors  the insurance companies  and the country  because they didn t want to be sued  Somebody s terminally ill  they take something  they die  and then the family sues them for killing the mother  the father  the sister  the brother  And I said   No  you re going to sign a document  and you re not going to sue anybody  but you re going to go home  and you re going to have the greatest drugs in the world that won t be approved for another four or five years   They re terminally ill  And we have saved thousands and thousands of lives  Thousands   cheers and applause  So we did a lot  and we have a lot of other things planned  Oh  by the way  all of that great work done  we had the greatest lab technicians  the greatest doctors  the greatest laboratories in the world  all of that  under her system  gets wiped out  They re close to a lot of great cures  I worked very hard on that  I also worked very hard on the FDA  getting them to bring it down  bring it down because it was going to ","take an average of 12 years to get something approved  I got it down to five  I wanted to get it down to two  but things have to happen  But we got it way  way down  and we came up with things  And we have thousands of people that are living today that were considered terminally ill just a short while ago  It s one of the things I m most proud it s called Right to Try  And hopefully  nobody in this room needs it  but if you do  you don t have to go to Asia  You don t have to go to Europe  Or if you have no money  you go home and you die  That s what happens  Mostly  people don t have any hope  They go home and die  Now you have Right to Try  and thousands of people are living right now that would not be living  We re also pleased to be joined by a very special man  a friend of mine who s been a warrior from day one  Dan Muser  Congressman Dan Meuser  Thank you  Dan  Great job  Mrs  Meuser  thank you

went through  Great job  That was a big win  Candidate for the 7th Congressional District  Ryan Mackenzie   cheers and applause Ryan  thank you  Congratulations  A man who we picked because  unlike a lot of states  including this one  we were leading by a lot  and then  all of a sudden  a miracle happened  We had another miracle happen about four weeks ago too  but this was a big miracle  and they found millions of votes  They found a lot of votes  But they didn t do that in North Carolina where he was the head of the Republican Party  And I said   Who is that guy   His name is Michael Whatley  and we appointed him the head of the RNC  the Republican National Committee  and he is doing a fantastic job   cheers and applause Really  really a great job  Thank you very much  He s going to keep their cheating down to a minimum  right  Maybe nothing  but we know them better  They won t stop  They won t stop  We have an expression   Too big to rig   right   Too big to rig    cheers and applause  And we re leading by a lot  even though we now have to run against some think of it  I spent 100 million  Now I have to run against somebody else  Is that fair  I think they should reimburse me for the 100 million  Who wants to collect  Does anybody want to go and collect  I ll get Front Row Joe to collect  The mayor  who s really a wonderful man  by the way  Mr  Mayor  it was good meeting you  Carl Curran  Thank you  Carl  Thank you very much  Thank you  Carl   cheers and applause  Good man  New York s Broome County DA  Paul Battisti  Paul Battisti   cheers and applause  Thank you  Paul  Thank you  Good job you re doing  I wish you were in Manhattan  We could use a good one in Manhattan  And Lackawanna County Commissioner Chris Chermak   cheers and applause  Chris  Thank you  Chris  Thank you  Chris  Good job   cheers and applause  On my first day back in the Oval Office  I will immediately sign an executive order directing every cabinet secretary and agency head to use every power we have to drive prices down  But we re going to drive them down in a capitalist way  not in a communist way  At the center of this effort will be to end Kamala s war on American energy  and we will drill  baby  drill   cheers and applause  We re going to get your energy prices down  We re going to get your energy prices down by 50   The Kamala presidency will mean death for Pennsylvania energy  Remember that  It ll mean death for Pennsylvania energy  Kamala imposed a natural gas export ban to cripple Pennsylvania energy producers  You do know that she s against this whole energy thing that you have going  which is by far the most important thing you have from an economic standpoint  a job standpoint  She s against it  Kamala supports a carbon tax on the working class  and she s vowed that she will ban fracking  which means 423  000 plus at least 150 000 jobs beyond that  Pennsylvania is going to always be fracking because we desperately need the energy  and we desperately need the jobs   cheers and applause  But she will end it  She will end it  In addition  your state and local government will be starved of billions of dollars in oil and gas revenue  which means higher taxes  lower property values  worse schools  and plunging quality of life in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that I love  I ve spent a lot of time here  I told you I went to school here  the Wharton School of Finance at Penn   cheers and applause  Under my leadership  we will make America energy independent and energy dominant  and Pennsylvania energy workers will lead the way  You re going to lead the way  It s big stuff  To further combat inflation  I will terminate Kamala Harris s green new scam  it s the greatest scam maybe ever played  and rescind all of the unspent funds  We re going to take those unspent funds and use them for roads and bridges  and we re going to give back a lot of money into the Treasury and pay down debt   cheers and applause  To make both new and used cars more affordable  I will end the Biden Harris electric vehicle mandate on day one  one of the most ridiculous things   cheers and applause  One of the most ridiculous things  Kamala now claims to want to cut red tape  but in less than four years  she s buried American families in regulations costing a typical household much more than $5 000 per year  Think of that  Just with their red tape  I will cancel Kamala s crushing regulatory onslaught  and I will immediately eliminate every costly job  Now  just so you know  I cut regulations more than any president in history by far   cheers and applause By far  So you can t say to me   Well  why didn t you do it   With me  you can t say that on anything  I did do it  everything I said  They said   Promises made  promises kept   What I said  I kept  I mean  unless there was some crazy thing somewhere  But I got it done  I got it all done  Even the wall  I built hundreds of miles of wall   cheers and applause  And I had to fight Congress  I had to fight the Senate like you wouldn t believe  I built hundreds of miles of wall  And I ended up taking it out and winning in court  We had 11 lawsuits by mostly Democrats like Nancy Pelosi  We had 11 different we won every one of them  But think of it  I built the wall  I said   I m taking it out of the military because our country s being invaded  This is an invasion of our country   And we built hundreds of miles of wall  Then we built and had made an extra 200 miles that we were going to use to expand it further than I ever said  and it was made and ready to be installed  and we had a rigged election  And what happened after that was they didn t want to do it  and they sold it for 5 cents on the dollar   booing  5 cents  Very sophisticated stuff  too  To get economic relief to workers and families  I will make the Trump tax cuts permanent  and we will have no tax on tips  which she copied   cheers and applause  She copied  You all know by now  she came out a few days ago  and she said   There will be no tax on   I said   I said that months ago   But here s one that she hasn t copied yet  to help seniors on fixed incomes who are suffering the ravages of horrible inflation caused by Crooked Joe and Kamala  there will be no tax on Social Security  so get out  And I get it done   cheers and applause  I will get it done  They won t  They haven t even promised it to you  but they won t get it done if they do  And I will always protect Social Security and Medicare for our great seniors  just as I did for four incredible years  By contrast  Kamala Harris has a three step plan to destroy Medicare and Social Security  She s going to destroy your Medicare  She s going to destroy your Social Security  First  she has thrown open our borders  Second  she is flooding our country with millions and millions of low wage migrants and giving them welfare  free healthcare  food stamps  public benefits   booing  And third  she wants to make them all citizens of the United States   booing  Many of them coming from prison  many of them coming from mental institutions  and many are terrorists  She wants to make them citizens  dumping them onto Medicare  and dumping them into your beautiful Social Security program  Remember  for four years  I saved Social Security  I never gave an increase  I never raised the age by five years  which is what they re going to end up doing  With me  it s staying the way it is  We have a lot of ways we re making money  We don t need to take it away from our seniors  The millions of illegal aliens pouring in under border czar she was the border czar  right  She was the border czar  Now  about a month ago  she said   I wasn t wasn t the border czar  She was the border czar  But it doesn t matter  She was in charge of the border a hundred percent  But border czar Harris are coming in from the worst places  some of the most dangerous countries in the world  And as I said  they re emptying out their jails and prisons and they re emptying out their mental institutions and they re dumping them into our country  What s happening to our country is shocking  It s unacceptable  And we have no choice  We re going to do the largest deportation in the history of our country   cheers and applause  We have no choice   cheers and applause  Just this week in Coney Island II  Kamala migrants were arrested for the rape of a 46 year old woman  throwing her to the ground and raping her with a knife to her throat   booing  She thought they were going to kill her  She said   They weren t looking to rape me  They were looking to kill me   And it was a terrible thing  One of them had previously been arrested for raping another woman at a migrant shelter  but he was shielded from deportation by New York City sanctuary laws  which Kamala Harris strongly supported and doesn t want to change   booing  In Virginia  three weeks ago  a 54 year old mother of four was leaving a 7 11 when she noticed an illegal alien trying to steal her car  When she tried to stop him  he ran her down and left her dead on the ground before going on to hit two more cars  killing two other drivers  And in May  the leader of a Peruvian gang known as Los Killers  was released from border patrol custody  and set free into America and Kamala s direct orders  she said   Set him free   Meanwhile  he was wanted for 23 murders in Peru  Kamala refuses even to call these criminals  and we not going to use the term  she said  illegal aliens  No  they are illegal aliens  but she said   Don t ever use that term   But they re not just illegal aliens  honestly  they re monsters  These are savage monsters   cheers and applause  The Harris policy is to let thousands of migrant killers and rapists into our country  She was asked the other day  but she didn t respond  We have detention centers where we have some of the worst criminals in the world in those detention centers from other countries and not just South America  They come from Africa  they come from Asia  they come from the Middle East  They come from countries that are seriously crime ridden  And those countries  the crimes are going way down like Venezuela  We talked about Venezuela or before  and think about Venezuela  Their crime is down 72   They ve gone to Caracas and they ve gone to different places in Venezuela  They ve taken their murderers  their drug dealers  their rapists  their thugs and they ve taken them out of the country  They ve said   You re going to the United States of America and if you come back  we will kill you   And they are now living with us  All will be criminals soon  And don t forget  they re just getting used to the experience of being in a country where criminals are treated better  far better than the people that are being hurt and victimized   booing  And when they see that and they re going to have levels of crime  I call it migrant crime  we ll call it Kamala migrant crime  She destroyed San Francisco  She destroyed Los Angeles  I call it migrant crime  She had something that she went with  You re not a criminal  It s a very minor offense if you steal anything from a store that s less than $950  did you know that  So guys are walking into stores with they walk into stores with a calculator  keep it under 950 and nothing s going to happen  By the way  if it goes to 9 050  nothing happens either  What s happened in California with Governor Newsom and guys like this  people like this is terrible  But Kamala  but Kamala  what environment  what a beautiful place  what a great place  The weather is so beautiful  the ocean  everything s beautiful  Its crime ridden and horrible and changes have to be made  The Trump policy is to keep these savage criminals the hell out of our country   cheers and applause They re going to be out of our country  If Kamala wins  you ll have mass amnesty and citizenship for all  She wants to give all of these people citizenship  In Venezuela  their crime is down 72   In other countries all over the world  their crime is way down  And in our country  wait till you see the real numbers because they re not counting migrant crime  which is going to make our crime look like baby stuff  If I win  you will have the largest operation of police to take care of us  They have to take care of us  They want to take care of us  They want to do their job   cheers and applause  As border patrol wants to do their job and it s going to start on inauguration day  January 20th  2025  It s going to start immediately   cheers and applause  They want to do their job and we don t let them  And if they do their job and if they re a little bit strong about doing their job  they re dealing with a lot of very tough people  They take away their pension  they take away their job  they lose their family  they lose their house  they lose everything  They end up in squalor  And we re not going to do that  We re going to defend our great local police and law enforcement  In general  we re going to defend them   cheers and applause  We re going to defend them  We want them to protect us and we re going to need them much more than ever before because the criminals pouring into our country by the millions  I believe the real number is over 20 million people  You don t hear that  10 million  12 million  even if it was  it s still so many  But the real number is over 20 million people  That s larger than New York state  Kamala Harris wants to eliminate private health insurance and give free taxpayer funded healthcare to every single illegal alien in the country   booing  And then you wonder why do they come up  You know why they come up  Because guys like Newsom and others are saying   Come up  come to our country  We ll give you healthcare   You know what they re doing to your school system is incredible  People are taking the seats of your children  Your children can t go to school  And you have people taking their seats that don t speak a word of English  come from a foreign country and your kids aren t getting educated  Your kids are not getting educated  They re considered like secondary citizens  And this is Kamala and Joe to a lesser extent  Look  Joe  Joe s lost  He s forget him  By contrast  I m going to keep the Affordable Care Act unless we can do something much better  We ll keep it  but we can do much better  It s too expensive for the people  They can t afford it  It s lousy healthcare  If we can do something better  we re working on it  If we can do something better  but we will never let anybody touch it unless we have something better  We re going to deliver lower prices  lower drug costs  and new options that will dramatically reduce the crushing burden on all American patients  And Kamala and Crooked Joe  they try and take credit for $35 insulin  but I was the one that did the $35 insulin  not them   cheers and applause  Just kicked in during their administration  I remember a couple of years  a few years ago  I said   Boy  oh boy   They said   Sir  this will kick in over the next two and a half  three years   I said   What about now   You couldn t do it  just to process  I said   I hope I win the presidency because I want to get credit for that   But he gets up there   Oh  we got $35   I got it  Kamala Harris   Democrat Party is the party of healthcare for illegals  The Republican Party is the party of common sense  We really are the party of common sense ultimately   cheers and applause  So we will bring back our supply chain  the supply chains  and they ve been so devastated  Our supply chains are  You order something and they say   Sir  that ll be four months   And then four months comes up and they say it s going to be another four months  It s stuck at sea  They have no idea where the hell it is  But we re going to bring them back from China and other foreign countries ending costly supply chain disruptions  And they are really bad  There is bad now as they were but we get used to it  We re living like a third world country  Who thought  As we reduce burdens on domestic manufacturers  American workers will make our critical goods better and cheaper right here in the USA and right here in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania   cheers and applause  And I will  with David  revoke China s most favored nation s trade status  You know  hey have a huge advantage  Because they are a growing nation  Well  we re a growing nation too  We re a nation that is crippled  We are a horribly crippled nation  And China gets all of these advantages in trade because they consider themselves to be a growing nation  Well  we re a growing nation too  And I did that already  I will pass what will be known as the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act  If China or any other country makes us pay 100 or 200  tariff  we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff of 100 or 200  right back  You hurt us  we hurt you  It s called an eye for an eye  I will also restore peace through strength and I will prevent World War III from happening  We will stop it   cheers and applause  When crooked  Hillary Clinton was running against me  She said   Look at him  Listen to him  He will start a war  a world war   We had no wars other than I defeated ISIS in its entirety  100  of the ISIS caliber   Listen to his rhetoric  Listen to his horrible tone   I said that horrible tone is going to keep people from fighting us  and that s what happened  We had no wars  It s been 81 years since that happened for a president  No wars other than ending some wars that we are in and defeating ISIS  Two days ago  I watched a parade of the Taliban in Afghanistan  Did you see it  The Taliban were they were showing all of our equipment that they took from America  $85 billion worth  two days ago  celebrating three years of the defeat of America by these guys  And I knew them very well  Abdul was the head  Abdul was not playing games with me  They were executing a lot of our soldiers  And I spoke to him  I said   Abdul  don t do it anymore  There ll be no more   Anyway  I said it pretty tough  And you know what  For 18 months we didn t have one American soldier killed in Afghanistan   cheers and applause  And then I left  And then I left  And this bunch of incompetent people took over and it all started up again  And then they had the most embarrassing day in the history of our country  I thought  But she bragged about being the last person in the room that night  the night that they decided to do whatever they decided to do  In other words  she had the final vote and she bragged about it  It s been the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country  Afghanistan  It should have never  ever happened  We should have gotten out with dignity and strength  And you don t take your military out first  You take your military out last  They couldn t believe we did it  Under Trump  we will have no more wars  no more disruptions  and we will have prosperity and peace for all  And again  we re going to bring back that American dream for all of the young people in this audience and some of the old ones  This is how we will end the era of inflation  mayhem and misery under Kamala and crooked Joe Biden and unleash safety  prosperity  and promise for Americans of every race  religion  color  and creed  Every single one of them are going to understand peace and wealth  And we re going to be a dominant force again  We re going to be respected as a country again  Right now  we re being laughed at that   cheers and applause  Together we will deliver low taxes  low regulations  low energy costs  low interest rates  low inflation  We had almost no inflation during my four years  almost nothing  And they went up to nine and a half percent  And that number s a fake number because they don t add the worst categories  It was much higher than that  But it was record setting inflation that everyone can we re going to make sure afford your groceries  afford a car  afford a home  low interest rates  We re going to get it all down  We will stop the invasion  We will end migrant crime  We ll support our great police  We will strengthen our military  build a missile defense shield over the top of our country  an iron dome  It ll be a great iron dome and much of it will be made right here in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania   cheers and applause  Why shouldn t we have that  Why shouldn t we have that  Other countries can have it  but we can t  It was our idea  Ronald Reagan wanted it many years ago  But then in all fairness  you didn t have the technology  Today  you do  We re going to have an iron dome to protect us from the lunatics out there  And we re going to keep critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools and we are going to keep men out of women s sports  No men in women s sports  Did you see in the Olympics  They had two transitioned  They transitioned  Uh they were men  They transitioned to women and they were in the boxing  And a young Italian woman was boxing one of the transitioned men  And she got hit with a jab   mimes punching  Just boom  A jab is not like the hard this is the harder one  right  If you re right handed  Boom  And she backed up  She said   What just hit me  I just got hit with a horse  What just hit me   Think of that  Then he did it again  Boom  And she said   Okay  that s enough   Two jabs  Then the other one and by the way  he went on to easily win the gold medal  He just walked through everybody   booing  He won the gold medal  Then there was another one  a transitioned man  and he also won the gold medal  He transitioned and he won the gold medal very easily  So the two fighters won the gold medals very easily  And she came out  the Italian girl  beautiful girl  very good boxer  And she said   Nobody s ever hit me like that   Two jabs  She said   I ve never been hit   She just said   That s enough  That s enough   It s crazy  It s so demeaning to women  How about the weightlifting  Hundreds of pounds more hundreds  Records that haven t been broken in 18 years  One eighth of an ounce here  one eighth of an ounce  And they can t do it  You could do it  They can t do it  And a guy comes out  excuse me  a transitioned person  How much more is that  Oh  that s 128 pounds more  How crazy is this  Our country has gone crazy and we re going to put it back on track  We are the party of common sense   cheers and applause  We will defend the Second Amendment  restore free speech  and we will secure our elections  Everyone will prosper  every family will thrive  We re going to be a thriving country again  And every day we ll be filled with joy  opportunity  and hope  Right now  it s filled with sorrow  It s sorrow  People are so embarrassed by what s happening to our country  They re waiting for Iran to drop weapons all over Israel  But it hasn t happened  You know why  Because our country is willing to pay them billions and billions of dollars  How about where they negotiate  I had 58 people  we negotiated and we didn t pay  58 hostages I got out  59 I think  and got them out even from North Korea  the toughest  Had a good relationship with Kim Jong Un  But I got them out  But you never pay because once you pay  you got to pay  How about we pay $6 billion  6 billion and we get some out  And in the case of Russia  they get the Prince of Doom  You know who the Prince of the greatest arms dealer  they say in the history of the world and they got him  And we also gave $6 billion  It s so embarrassing  And the world is watching  And when you pay $6 billion  all of a sudden people are going to be disappearing from the streets all over the place  And it s a very bad precedent is being set in many ways  including the weaponization of our government  I could have done that with Hillary Clinton  And I said to myself   How would it look  We re trying to unify the country  How would it
